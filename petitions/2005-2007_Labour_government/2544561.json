            "background": "Young and experienced drivers are currently allowed to drive in the UK if they have a driving licence obtained in their country. In many countries the driving standards required fall well short of those required in the UK and driving in the UK offers challenges to these drivers that they are unable to meet (left hand side, UK cities, country roads, UK motorways etc). Drivers from overseas countries who cannot demonstrate 5 years regular driving should be required to take a UK driving test before they are allowed to drive in the UK",
