They need to have a fair and level playing field in order to survive. I propose a levy for each time a Foreign registered HGV enters the UK to redress the balance and help to maintain our roads and give our haulage industry a chance.\n\nAlso For customs to check each HGV as it enters for current documentary evidence of roadworthiness and Insurance.\n\nThank you",
