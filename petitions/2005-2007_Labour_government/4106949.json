        "background": "As far as I understand man made CO2 is a heavier than air gas. Therefore I would urge the government to further investigate the claims that this gas is responsible for global warming, when it would be impossible for this gas to be able to travel upwards into the area of the Earths atmoshere where the Greenhouse gases are. Basic chemistry tells people that heavy gases sink rather than rise. It is my opinion that the Government is looking at a product of Global Warming and not its cause, and that as a gas it is not responsible for the climate change that is being sited by the IPCC",
