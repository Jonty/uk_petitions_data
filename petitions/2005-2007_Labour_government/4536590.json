            "background": "Airport security is a bigger threat today than it was 15 years ago, back then the security was police. We need to get this back to stop the abuse, also security is not taken seriously by anyone passing through uk airports, where as police was! If you go to America you do as they tell you, and it should apply here too at all uk airports! Why have police 15 years ago when threat levels are low, and security when threat levels are high! This is the only country i know of that uses security!",
