            "background": "I have read countless stories, in local and national newspapers, about people who have caused the death of innocent people by driving while over the legal alcoholic limit and who receive what I believe to be very lenient prison sentences. People who have been found guilty of this crime should be tried on charges of manslaughter, at the very least, given higher sentences than are currently issued and banned from driving for life.",
