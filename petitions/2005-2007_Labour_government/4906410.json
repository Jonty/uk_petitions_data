        "background": "The UK has a serious binge-drinking problem.  Alcohol is a dangerous drug but also one of the oldest most pervasive so there's little chance of it being outlawed.  Almost every adult has consumed alcohol, as well as many children, but a growing number are consuming it to dangerous excess.  Although the new 24 hour licensing law was is meant to be a way of trying to combat this problem, unfortunately the powers at be just dont understand the power of alcohol as a mind altering substance. The idea that if we can drink at any time we won't be in such a rush to get drunk is a complete nonsense.  The law should be reversed with immediate effect.",
