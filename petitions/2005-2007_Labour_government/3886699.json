Since employers value previous work experience far more than degrees graduates are discriminated against, and often have to wait for months or years before they can get a suitable job.\n\nFor this reason the Government should provide more opportunities for graduates at Jobcentre Plus, to enable them to find a job rather than continue to claim unemployment benefits.",
