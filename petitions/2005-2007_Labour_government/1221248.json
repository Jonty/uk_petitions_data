            "background": "The good people of Basildon, Essex have for far too long been castigated in the media for our lack of culture. The town was taken by surprise last year when over 40,000 people attended an exhibition of local art held over a six month period. Having reaffirmed its love of art, Basildon now wants a\ncontemporary art gallery and seeks your support in this. We the undersigned support the people of Basildon in their quest for a Contemporary Art Gallery. Furthermore, we hope that they will be successful in persuading their elected representatives to save the Swimming Pool building for this purpose.",
