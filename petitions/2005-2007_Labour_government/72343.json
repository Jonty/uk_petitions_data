            "background": "To tackle the drugs problem requires military strategy against the energy of the illegal drugs trade, easy and vast profits. The target is to diminish such profits by drug dealers. Action.\nMake the selling of prescribed drugs government monopoly, selling to registered drug users at very low prices, decriminalising the use of drugs so obtained. Result.\nDrugs dealers would have no returns on their investment as the government agencies (hospitals, GPs, pharmacies etc) would take their markets away.\nDealers would face fines by HM Customs and Excise, rendering the exercise futile and neutralised. \nDrug users would turn to government agencies for their supply who  provide the drugs against controlled registration, allowing the authorities to know  who the users are, where they are. In turn,  to take control of the problem and help reducing the drug dependence for users.\n\nThe need for users to commit criminal action to finance their habits would be reduced.  \nGeorge Bekes, Whitstable",
