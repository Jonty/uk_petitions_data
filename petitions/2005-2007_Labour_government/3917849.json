This afternoon i searched one of the auction sites for \"Police tickets\" and found 1190 entries. Clearly these are not real fans who have found themselves unable to attend the concert, they are the lowest form of pond-life TOUTS. This practice hugely inflates the price of tickets to the real fans, plus the louts who blockade the venues before the concert make the whole process a very unpleasant one. Why is this allowed to happen? The government needs to work with the ticket agencies and venues, and also make the selling of tickets, either in the street or electronically totally illegal.",
