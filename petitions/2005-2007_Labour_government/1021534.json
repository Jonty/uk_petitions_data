The picture of my car shows that it was taken at angle, meaning that the police were skulking in the bushes at the side of the bridge. Internet research shows that an angled shot is more likely to be inaccurate. They said I was doing 88, but my passenger, cruise control and Road Angel say different. Then they blackmailed me by saying that if I didn't accept \u00a360 and three points and went to court it might be \u00a31,000 and more points. The Government and the police are no better then the Robber Barons of old.",
