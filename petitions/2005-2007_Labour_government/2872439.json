        "background": "An initial face to face interview to gain a passport is a good idea; however having to attend an interview to RENEW your passport is a waste of tax payers money and also very inconvenient for the general UK citizen.  For people that do not live near a passport office this could involve a whole day wasted traveling to their nearest office and cost a lot of money in travel fares.  Once you have passed an initial interview, I can see no purpose in having further interviews every 5 years for under 18's and every 10 years for adults.",
