They have had to accept \"positive discrimination\" which changed the face of the industry from predominantly 88% male to 54% female in less than ten years, the introduction of hundreds of new channels which caused budgets to fall and watered down the quality of product supplied, and now, since the government introduced the new tax structure in March 2007, the amount of their work has drastically reduced because of better deals for producers to be found abroad.",
