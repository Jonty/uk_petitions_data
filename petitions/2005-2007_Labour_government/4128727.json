            "background": "It's true to say that the road fund licence is an unfair tax; everyone pays the same levy irrespective of vehicle usage. Some people only drive a few thousand miles a year, whilst others travel 50,000 miles a year, yet we pay the same levy each year. Doesn't quite add up does it. Now we have a further proposed increase for so called gas guzzlers. 4X4's are the natural target for this tax, but what about all the people carriers that are of a similar footprint and capacity to the 4X4's? Where will this increase end? If the road fund licence is put on the fuel that we use, it will be impossible for individuals to dodge payment of the duty, and those that use more fuel will pay more for the privilege.",
