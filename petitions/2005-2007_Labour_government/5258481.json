            "background": "This so called lady has seriously insulted members of the armed forces who have been injured whilst serving you, NATO and their country in Iraq or Afghanistan.  She has stated that these injured heroes should not be protected from the insults of Muslims whilst under treatment in Selly Oak Hospital.  She is obviously at odds with the Government, does NOT support Nu-Labour Party policy in that she doesn't agree with the action being taken in the war against terror and should be removed.  Consideration should also be given to bringing her to trial on a charge of treason.",
