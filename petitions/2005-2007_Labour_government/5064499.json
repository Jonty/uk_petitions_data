            "background": "The sports centres in Enfield have become bankrupt due to incompetence and mismanagement and receivers have now been called in. Fees to all sports clubs and individuals have rocketed by between 100% and 300% during the last month and clubs and residents of Enfield are being priced out of the Sports Centres. In spite of this incompetence another sports centre is in the process of being built and this has drained recourses from existing sports centres, hence the hike in charges.\nClubs will not be able to afford these charges and will go under unless something is quickly done. These local clubs that have taken years to build up will not be able to be 'resurrected' at a later point.\nChildren and parents depend on the clubs and the sports centres which form part of the social character of the area.\nJoan Ryan the MP for the area is trying hard but as yet had no results. Clubs have been given one month to accept these charges and sign a new contract or get out.",
