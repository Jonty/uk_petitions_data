        "background": "The bus lanes in London are to allow public transportation to move freely in a very congested city. They are also open to cyclists to help these vulnerable road users travel in greater safety.\n\nLondon Taxis are prohibitively expensive to most Londoners, and are not part of London Transport. They do not constitute public transport.\n\nFurther, if the number of passengers carried by taxis and buses is compared, and the area they occupy on the road is considered, it can be seen that Taxis relatively increase congestion, rather than diminish it.\n\nBanning taxis from bus lanes is a move to improve public transportation and the safety of London's roads.",
