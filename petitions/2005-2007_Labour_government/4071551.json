You can make a change, but not like this.\n\nDon't give anyone in a position of power the smug feeling they've engaged with voters just by \"reading\" this constant stream of petitions. There's more than 4,500 of them on this site alone!!! Don't give them free market research. They can work for their jobs. At this rate, soon there will be a Minister For Petitions, at great cost to us the taxpayers. \n\nGo and do something real that engages with people and share your passion, your knowledge, your feelings, and really make a change.\n\nThanks\n\nStrummerbus",
