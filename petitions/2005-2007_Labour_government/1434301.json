        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A petition to highlight the outrage felt by viewers of the C4 programme Dispatches. \nThe documentary showed a 12 year old girl having to act as the parent to 5 other siblings of reducing ages, whilst the the parents sat by and watched. \nThe parents of these children are both partially sighted and used this as an excuse to not take part in raising their six children. Infact they seemed intent on having at least another 2 children so they would have plenty of siblings \"to take care of them when they are older\". \nThe house in which the family lived was filthy, but the parents would only accept 2 hours per week, of cleaning help from Social Services. \nOn the whole I feel that the treatment of the children, by the parents, was neglectfull, and tantamount to child abuse. \nPlease sigh the petition in the hope that the plight of these children, and others like them does not fall on deaf ears.",
