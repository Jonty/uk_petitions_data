        "background": "This is a large issue for younger drivers, but hits learner drivers the hardest as it is nearly impossible for a male to get car insurance for less than \u00a31700, whereas females have no trouble getting insurance for less than \u00a31000. I believe that this is discrimination against younger male drivers and in some way this should be prevented.\nYour support is vital.",
