It makes no mention of stealth taxes and, even though it does object to a single tax rate, it does not ask for tax bands to be increased in line with inflation.    \nRe banning all taxes except on purchases: if this happened the rate of such a tax would have to be so extortionate (to make up for the loss of all other revenue) that few people would be able to afford anything other than the most basic of necessities.  \nThe idea of charging everyone the same percentage of taxation might SEEM fair but not if you think about it: a rate of, e.g., 10% would leave someone on an income of \u00a320,000 with \u00a318,000 whereas someone on \u00a3200,000 would be left with \u00a3180,000; how can that possibly be fair?",
