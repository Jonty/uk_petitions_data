            "background": "Although the recent Eddington Review made some sensible short term recommendations to help with some local congestion issues, the Review failed to provide a long term vision to transform rather than fix our transport infrastructure. \n\nWe need urgently to exand capacity nationally to reduce costs, reduce travel time, increase national cohesion and reduce environmental effects. \nA national fast rail network would be as transformative to the British economy and society as European high speed railways have been. \n\nTravel in the UK is currently dramatically more expensive than in Europe, is frustrating and less reliable than is acceptable. It takes too long - and too many cannot afford it or have to tarvel in uncomfortable conditions on slow trains or buses over long distances.\n\nThe network should seek to eliminate the need for internal air travel inside England and cut dramatically the need for that with Scotland and Wales.",
