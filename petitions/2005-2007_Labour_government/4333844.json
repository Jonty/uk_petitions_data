        "background": "Newsreader Moira Stuart has been forced out of presenting early morning bulletins because she is too old, it was reported today. \n\nThe 55-year-old blames ageism at the BBC for her being removed from reading the bulletins on Andrew Marr's Sunday AM programme. \n\nMs Stuart, Britain's first black female newscaster, told friends she was \"very disappointed\". \n\nOne said: \"This was not her decision, it was the BBC's.\" Another added the move was a \"source of great disappointment\" to the broadcaster. Friends said Ms Stuart believed it was due to the fact that there are other, younger, presenters ready to take her place. \n\nI demand they bring he back, and drop this agest attitude!\n\nShe one of the most liked and respected news readers.",
