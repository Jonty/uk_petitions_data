(leading to a culture of \"you can't do anything!\" by many children.) Unfortunately some children need tough love to put them on the right path, and others need the reinforcement that there is concequences for negative actions. It must be considered also, that if a child is being told they can get away with whatever they like without any physical challenge or restrainght is giving them unrealistic expectations, better for the child to have negative behaviour challenged and nipped in the bud? Bring back the cane!",
