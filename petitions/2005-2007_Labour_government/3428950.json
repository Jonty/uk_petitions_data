            "background": "This petition is concerned with ensuring that before the emplacement of any USA interceptor missiles with UK Sovereign jurisdiction that appropriate agreement(s)are in place governing use and launch.  The petition seeks a bilateral agreement between the UK and USA Governments that would provide that before the hostile launch of any interceptor missile from UK soil that the UK Government of the day has full knowledge of the launch and the intended target and has permitted such a launch by not exercising its inviolable power of Veto.  The petition seeks to put in place the structure that ensures that the UK is a full partner with the USA and not simply a North Atlantic missile emplacement controlled exclusively to serve a US Foreign policy interest that has no support in the UK.",
