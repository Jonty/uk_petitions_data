            "background": "Our children are being taught a very narrow curriculum in many respects. How many children leave school knowing very little history beyond the 20th century, The tudors and perhaps the slave trade. Surely children should know (at least in passing) more about the past than this. If we know more about the past we can understand ourselves and our culture better. Moreover, look at the very heart of our culture, it comes from either the Reformation, the Anglo Saxons, the Normans or the Greco/Romans. As John Mill famously said the Battle of Marathon was more important in British history than the Battle of Hastings. Moreover, our children should be equipped with the skills and knowledge they need to make well informed choices in many fields such as politics, morality and ethics, and banking. As such our children should be taught some form of philosophy so that they have the tools to enable these choices. They should also be taught about banking and other related matters so that when it comes to university or work they understand how these essential parts of daily life operate.",
