            "background": "Tenants of period conversions regularly have their lives blighted by noise from neighbours as these properties have no sound insulation at all. Also the construction of older houses enables noise to amplify as it travels through walls and along joists. The sleep deprivation and stress related illnesses this causes is unacceptable. \nThe law does not require L/As to investigate normal behaviour but due to the amplification effect even normal conversations/movements can be disturbing especially at night. Furthermore, current legislation allows L/As to consider antisocial behaviour in the form of door slamming, stamping on floors etc, normal. \nIt is astonishing that even the quietest tenants cannot have basic privacy at home without being heard by or forced to listen to others. Also, young children being forced to listen to the sex lives of neighbours is abusive. This petition calls for social housing providers to soundproof older properties as is required for new homes.",
