            "background": "Richard Brunstrom North Wales Police Chief has used photographs of a decapitated biker in his latest anti-speeding campaign.\n\nThe man has taken his hard-line against speeding too far on many occasions and this latest event is just pushing things too far.\n\nRichard Brunstrom is the most controversial policeman in the UK. He has been criticised in the tabloid press and by motoring organisations for his hard-lined and uncompromising support for speed cameras.\n\nHe isn't shy to speak out on issues such as drugs. He likes colourful language and regularly criticises motoring organisations, but his outbursts suggest that he doesn't actually think anything through.\n\nMost people in the UK would support of sensible traffic policing. Brunstrom takes such an extreme and damaging position that the police and the public will have a firmer wedge between them if this man continues his empolyment with the police force.",
