            "background": "It's a sad state of affairs that few local water authorities fluoridate the drinking water supply while it is nigh impossible to get on an NHS dentist's list. The least we could be doing is fluoridating all tapwater so as to reduce tooth decay. At a recommended 1.0 mg/l it is a safe and easy way to help fight tooth decay. For so little, we could help so many who live in areas where the water contains little natural fluoride.",
