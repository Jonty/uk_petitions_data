Rather than just arresting them or assuming that adults know what young people want, let's actually ask them!!\n\nYouth forums or councils are pretty cheap to run and begin to break down barriers within communities. All it involves are a few adults in charge of parts of a community, lots of young people, a comfy venue and loads of pizza.",
