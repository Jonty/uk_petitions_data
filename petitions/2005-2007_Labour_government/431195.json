The services that we recieve continue to deteriorate whilst the cost of living continues to escalate. It has become totally unaffordable to live in london, manage student debts and our studies. We would like to request the Right Hon'ble Prime Minister and the Honorable Chancellor of the Exchequer to do something to make student life more affordable in the capital.",
