            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Hundreds of small animals are kept and sold in pet shops. More often than not they are poked at, shipped around from one store to another, and kept in poor conditions, with staff having little knowledge about how to care for their needs, If people want to buy small animals they should be directed to reputable breeders who will provide good quality, well cared for animals, and will be able to pass on the correct knowledge to the prospective owner on how to care for their chosen pet. To many times do children and adults impulse buy rabbits, mice, hamsters etc, only to become bored with them at a later stage and the rescue centres have to deal with the sad obvious outcome. If you had to arrange to buy your pet from a reputable breeder, there would be time to seriously consider if that is the right pet for you, and the breeder will always be there to offer free advice in the future.",
