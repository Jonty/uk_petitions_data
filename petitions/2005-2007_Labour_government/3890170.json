I am a student who is taking my GCSEs this year, and I, quite honestly, am frustrated with the standards of the Edexcel mark schemes. One must jump through numerous hoops, but these hoops are moved, or shrunk in diameter to suit THEIR needs. I therefore ask the PM to investigate the appropriateness of Edexcel.",
