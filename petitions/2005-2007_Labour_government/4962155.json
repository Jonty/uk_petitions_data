The types of events that I grew up with in the country were Belton Barrow race and the Haxey Hood (please feel free to google).  The barrow race consisted of a 3 mile run pushing a wheel barrow with your team mate in it then swopping over at intervals - and stopping at a range of pubs to drink a pint very quickly.  The Haxey Hood was also a similar event - but more rugby style and consisting of pushing the Hood to a pub.  Its what our country needs and was something the people really looked forward to - great family fun.",
