            "background": "As people using motorcycles will be well aware, this is a form of transport that not only creates no congestion, but also sucessfully bypasses any existing congestion. Further, even older generation of motorcycles are far more environmentally friendly than the average car on today's roads. This gap is only being exaggerated by time.\nFurther still, the majority of motorcycles do not require the provision of parking spaces.\nFor these reasons, we consider it unfair to be expected to pay both road tax & fuel tax, which should be illegal regardless, due to it being a form of \"double taxation.\"",
