            "background": "Is it me or are spaces getting smaller or cars getting wider?\nEither way, I am fed up of parking my car in a tiny space, only to return and find a dent in it where some individual has hit it with their door. It is clearly the plan of developers to cram as many spaces in as possible and turn us into sardines, with all the damage that goes with it.\nThe space given to disabled drivers is great, but why not for the rest of us? Maybe everyone should buy an old banger just to take to these awful carparks.\nIf you believe you should be entitled to have your property treated with respect and be given a reasonable amount of space, then please sign this petition.",
