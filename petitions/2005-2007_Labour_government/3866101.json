            "background": "Criminals often make a mockery of the Criminal Justice System by exploiting loopholes in the law provided by the human rights act, I propose a simple law, if you breach someone elses human rights, You automatically void your own. This will stop the necessity for criminals to be treated with extra care through fear of breaching human rights they are not entiitled to.  There is no problem with the human rights act, just it is being abused by those who should not be entitled to the benefits of it. I am not advocating mis-treatment of offenders in any way, Just stop them using a law of protection they denied thier victim to thier advantage.",
