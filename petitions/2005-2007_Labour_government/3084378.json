        "action": "Re-instate the death penalty for serious criminal offences such as murder of a minor and murder of a police officer.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Prison sentences no longer act as a deterrent and many of those released from our jails go on to commit more serious offences.  Prison as a means of rehabilitation is questionable and expensive with each prisoner costing approximately \u00a350000pa to incarcerate.  The death penalty, whilst harsh, is merited in some cases for example the Soham murderer Ian Huntley.  I believe strongly that these cowardly criminals would seriously think twice before committing these heinous crimes if the result would mean losing their own sorry lives.  Today\u2019s\u2019 society shows a marked lack of respect for authority, human life and other peoples property.  It is time to re-introduce the death penalty and give our law enforcement agencies and criminal justice system some real teeth in order to restore respect in our country.",
