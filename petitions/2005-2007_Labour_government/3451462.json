The Road Fund Licence disk currently displayed on each vehicle should be replaced with a DVLA disk that confirms the vehicle is both insured and has met any relevant testing by the existing agencies.  Further, all driving licence-holders should be required to sit a driving re-test every 10 years at their own expense. THIS (and not \"snooping on the public\" with so-called road pricing) will REALLY reduce congestion.",
