            "background": "I belive there are thousands of mothers of children who are sexually abused by thier childrens father's, and losing custody of their children because Judges and social services are adiment the mother knew the abuse was happening and failed to protect I know families are being further dammaged by the court system as the social services and judges in civil cases that are baicaly designed to give the social services exactly what they want and not what is REALLY in the best interest of the child, these cases often lead to adpoption or fostercare for an already traumatised child and often needless destruction of families of then human rights of mothers are breached an she is left with no support, no children and no life she will often loose the right to a family life and can be placed through many years of emotional trauma being made to relive what happened not once but many times over the years depending on how many children are invoved there is no after support for the mother",
