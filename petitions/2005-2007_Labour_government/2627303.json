            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "These changes to the law will help keep cannabis off the streets and dissuade sellers to sell to those under the age of 18 therefore keeping our youth away from drugs until an age when they can make an informed decision about use. This will also dissuade people from using cannabis on the streets and keep sales out of public areas. We have seen in the past year a huge amount of cannabis being sold contaminated with silica particles which is a public heath risk. These changes to the law would put a stop to drug gangs damaging the user.",
