And despite many generations having invested into these vital national assets for its future wellbeing.\n\nNo UK CE has the right to asset-strip the Co's heart for short-term (Treasury) gains.\n\nIt was immoral and undemocratic to do so in the first place; now ALL present problems stem from those myopic acts.\n\nIt must be remedied before British society decays further. And soon, even if it costs us all dearly in the short term.",
