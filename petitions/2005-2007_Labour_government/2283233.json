            "background": "A fairer way to tax the use of road vehicles is to link it in with the mileage covered. The lost revenue from road tax may be offset by increased duty on fuel. Those who travel the furthest, use the roads more, pay the most tax. From a green angle it will also encourage the use of more efficient vehicles. A large percentage of high mileage is carried out for businesses who can more easily afford to pay for using the roads. Let those who use the roads most pay the most.",
