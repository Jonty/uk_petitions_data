            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Children from lesser financial backgrounds are less likely to attend private fee paying schools due to a lack of financial resources by parents to pay tuition fees. The system of \"assisted places\" which existed until recently, should be restored to enable children receive financial assistance to attend private schools. Although many private schools offer scholarships, these limited in number. A system of \"assisted places\" would enable a greater number of children to attend a secondary school within the private sector. A system could be established in which instead of money paid by the LEA (Local Educational Authority) to the state school for a pupil to attend, it is paid to the private school of choice(% of tutition fees/based on ability (via exam)). This would enable a greater access to the private educational system, using the same money paid to educate a child in the state system diverted to a private school, enabling greater access for all to education within the private sector.",
