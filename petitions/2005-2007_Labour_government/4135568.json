These crates are untidy and don't hold very much. \n\nIf councils were forced to supply and collect weekly a suitable large bin to collect the recyclable waste, more waste would be recycled.\n\nBefore there is any reduction in waste collections, or increase in charges recycling should be made easy. Better to use the carrot than the stick!!",
