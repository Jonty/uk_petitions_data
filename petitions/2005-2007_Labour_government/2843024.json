            "background": "The introduction of the proposed passport application interviews is an attempt to \"cut down on passport fraud\".\n\nThe proposal is that every first time applicant will have to undergo an interview just to be approved for a passport. However there is a second more worrying clause.\n\nIt is being promoted as for first time applicants only. This is not the case; it is actually going to mean that in 2009 UK citizens will have to undergo a personal interview EVERY time they wish to renew a passport.\n\nIt is a restrictive practice to expect a citizen of a country to go through interviews every time their passport expires; just to retain the right to travel outside the UK.\n\nIt is also creating an opportunity in the future that passport applications be turned down for genuine applicants as a result of the interview - which could potentially be used to restrict the movement of people from this country.",
