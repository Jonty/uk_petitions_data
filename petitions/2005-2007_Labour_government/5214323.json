        "background": "I am a working parent, who gets paid monthly, as does my husband. We find it difficult to manage financially sometimes. Because we both work, we CANNOT have our Child Benefit paid weekly, we have to recieve it once a month. I find this grossly unfair, as a regular income each week would help us, (and I presume other families), greatly. Again the Government is discriminating against working parents. We should be given the choice to have this money paid to us weekly or monthly.",
