Because we both work, we CANNOT have our Child Benefit paid weekly, we have to recieve it once a month. I find this grossly unfair, as a regular income each week would help us, (and I presume other families), greatly. Again the Government is discriminating against working parents. We should be given the choice to have this money paid to us weekly or monthly.",
