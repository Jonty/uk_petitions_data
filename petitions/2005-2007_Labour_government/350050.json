        "background": "The re-introduction of caning in schools would give the authorities a weapon against the disobedience of todays juveniles. Administering the birch as previously used in the Isle of Man would act as a deterrant and/or punishment for offences committed while under the influence of drink. People are willing to pay small fines for offences that they seem to enjoy perpetrating, but a sore backside might make them think twice.",
