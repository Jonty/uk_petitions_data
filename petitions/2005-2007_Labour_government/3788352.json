I was already working for only \u00a330 a month once all bills and childcare were paid but now \u00a3730 short. Why should I work when you get hardly any help and my finances are not in my control when all I've done is be honest with the amount I've earnt! I'm sure theres many stories like these....If you know anyone who has had simiular problem please sign this petition.!!!",
