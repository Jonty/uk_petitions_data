            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I recently read that the Bank of England has a considerable number of these notes in its vaults but that it will not release them because high-street banks do not put \u00a35 notes in their ATMs.  Be that as it may presumably these banks do have \u00a35 notes in their tills; the Bank of England could therefore release its notes for that purpose.  The main reason for this petition is my frustration at so often receiving pound coins, rather than \u00a35 notes, in my change when I pay for my shopping; why is it apparently not possible to supply shops with more \u00a35 notes?",
