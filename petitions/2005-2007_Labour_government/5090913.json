Now it seems that the Real face there dimise.  What is needed is a new secretary/chairman to give management team lord ward and richy prev some finances and help solve this crsis and save this great club.  we do not need massive funding, just 25 a week for drunken ducan, a few bob for the pitch and a new kit would be nice.\n\nso hear i am askig the government if they could loan out this chancellor fella.  he manages the finances of the country by collecting millions in tax so maybe, just maybe he could manage to get 3 quid every sunday from the bear.\n\nplease support us with your signature",
