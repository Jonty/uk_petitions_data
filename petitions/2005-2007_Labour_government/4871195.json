        "background": "Many members of society, including the electorate and politicians, are increasingly worried about increasingly low turnout in elections. We petition the government to enact legislation to include an option declaring 'none of the above' or 'abstain' on every ballot paper in local and national elections. Should, upon completing a vote count, this option be in the majority, the election will be declared 'null and void' and another vote be called. In this way the electorate will have a way to show if they are truly discontented with contemporary politics by registering a vote of no-confidence in the electoral process.",
