Record profits yet again linger in the clouded atmosphere as corporate fatcats rub their hands together with glee whilst choking on the poor quality air around us all. The only way to save the earth is to sacrifice the economy. 1 year of dedication to sacrifice profit and make all our businesses greener would set an example for other countries and also give our country a head start in the race to become green. We all beleive it would be worthwhile because we can't wait any longer for someone else to lead the way.",
