How good than their behaviour possibly be when they are convicted criminals?\n\nPrisoners should serve their FULL sentence, otherwise why sentence them at all?  What is the point of saying life, when for some it could only mean 7 years?\n\nIts time to sort out our sentencing laws, and ensure that convicted criminals are punished as the judge saw fit.  How these laws still be in existence when they are simply crazy is beyond me.",
