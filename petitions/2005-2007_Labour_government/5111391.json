The residents of these  villages pay council tax etc to Darlington Borough Council, yet our votes are not counted for the Darlington  MP,  but for the  election  of  the  Sedgefield  MP ( currently T Blair ). Darlington &  its  villages heritage is railways, market town, rural affairs,  not  like Sedgefield's history  of coal mining / coke works etc.",
