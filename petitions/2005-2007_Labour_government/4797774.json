        "action": "set the amount of Child Tax Credit payments retrospective with regards to income paid in the previous tax year, rather than basing it on an estimate of future earnings.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently the amount of Child Tax Credit paid is based on what you may earn in the following tax year.  If this amount changes throughout the year then HM Revenue & Customs will reduce your claim and order you to repay the overpayment immediately or receive NO CTC until the overpayment has been recovered.  In the majority of cases it is impossible to give an accurate figure of future earnings, therefore forcing claimants to estimate their income.  If the claim is based retrospectively based upon last years income, this will mean that families can set themselves a realistic budget.  This will save the millions of pounds in overpayments and prevent many families getting into financial difficulties.",
