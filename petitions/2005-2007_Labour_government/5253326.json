            "background": "Currently the BBC make their web content available in two, propriety, formats: WMA and Real Audio. The BBC are now proposing to use DRM technology. This will unnecessarily encumber listeners and viewers. Further, the BBC's use of propriety formats make listening to or watching BBC content unnecessarily difficult on platforms such as GNU/Linux and hinder its adoption. We therefore urge the Prime Minister to encourage the  BBC to use free formats such as Ogg Vorbis.",
