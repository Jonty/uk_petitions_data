If a patient has a seriously ill relative/friend oris themselves seriously ill and needing to visit the hospital often ( as is the case for cancer, renal patients) this can be very expensive. Often relatives who have to deal with grief and bereavement also have to worry about finding change for the parking charge. it is unethical and immoral and Trusts aremaking a fortune out of those in need.",
