            "background": "1. Promises are frequently made by organisations and/or their representatives for the purpose of attaining public office through the mechanism of local or national elections.\n\n2. We believe such promises may reasonably be said to be of the essence of a contract agreed between an elected candidate and/or organisation and the electorate.\n\n3. We deplore the frequent breach of such promises and note that no mechanism currently exists to monitor and/or hold to account the defaulting parties\n\n3. We therefore petition the Prime Minister to use public funds to study the establishment of an independent permanent Commission to create and administer the framework within which the monitoring of such breaches and the holding to account of their perpetrators would take place.",
