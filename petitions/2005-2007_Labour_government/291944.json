There have also been identifiable cases of swastikas and various other obscenities dubbed on synagogue walls. This has resulted in the Jewish community receiving protection from the Community Security Trust, an organisation tasked to protect and offer safety guidelines to Jewish places of worship.\n\nThe Government ought to assist the Jewish community in bringing forward policies and solutions in targeting anti-Semitism and provide constructive mechanisms for the community to work with various other faith communities.  As community engagement and community cohesion is vital in promoting understanding and tackling anti-Semitism on the ground. \n\nAll Government departments ought to be committed to tackling all forms of anti-Semitism at every level of society.",
