            "background": "In light of recent events. it is clear that a culture, with a total disregard for human life is developing in this country. \n\nDespite legislation making firearms illegal, gun crimes are on the increase. A five year prison sentance is no deterant for carrying firearms, and likely to force the offenders to be ever more younger. \n\nIn the current gang culture, receiving a custodial sentance with parole for \"good\" behaviour is more of a badge of honour than a meaningful deterant.\n\nThe death sentance may be considered by many as not humane, and not an ideal solution.  But until alternative methods can be developed to protect the decent, innocent people of this nation, and keep gun toting, mindless murdering gang thugs off of our streets, it is the ONLY solution.",
