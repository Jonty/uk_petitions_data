It is a sad fact that the achievements of black people have been overlooked and ignored. I believe that very little progress has been addressed upon the issues about, past and present black achievers who have contributed their own successes in Education, The Arts, Media, Commerce, Politics, Agriculture, Architecture, Science, Inventions, Explorers, and the Military within cultural society.",
