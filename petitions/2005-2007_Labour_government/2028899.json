            "background": "Council tenants have been cheated out of owning their homes due to capping of discounts at around \u00a326,000. I have 21 years tenancy and would have got my house at approx 50% discount ( ie value \u00a3150,000 right to buy price approx \u00a375,000.) When I applied for right to buy I was told due to maximum  discount of \u00a326,000 I would have to pay \u00a3128,000 for my house. Long term tenants have been cheated out of their discounts and were not adequately informed before the changes. My local council said they did not have the \"facilities\" to inform the tenants. I agree that some people misused the right to buy and bought just to sell but what about people like myself that want to buy my house and have no intention of moving again. I cannot afford to buy my house now but with the discount would have been able to do so. The Government should allow long term tenants to buy at previous discounted rates even if we have to pay the discount back should we decide to sell within a set time.",
