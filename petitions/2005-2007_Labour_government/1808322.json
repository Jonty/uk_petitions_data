Typing this in would simply bring up a name, address, date of birth, and a 'recent' photo. This would be enough for most basic ID purposes. (Much better than \"a recent utility bill\"!) Internet access is rapidly becoming universal, including totally mobile access. For example, even foot patrol police could have internet access. Implementation involves existing proven simple technology. Individuals could upload their own details + photo. Those without access to the technology (an ever decreasing number) could hand details into a post office (an ever decreasing facility) for 'upload'.",
