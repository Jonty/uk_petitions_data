            "background": "There is a growing problem in this country of parents failing to raise their children properly and the law having no powers to punish either. My solution to this would be to bring back the stocks for both the children offending and the parents who failed to bring them up properly. A day of standing in the cold being pelted with rotten fruit should make bad parents aware of their responsibilities both to their children and society as a whole.",
