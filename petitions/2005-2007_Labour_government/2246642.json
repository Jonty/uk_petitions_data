            "background": "Aviation is the fastest-growing source of greenhouse-gas emissions, already accounting for eight million tonnes of carbon dioxide each year - more than 10 per cent of the UK total. If we do not try to cut carbon emissions, by the end of the century, human civilisation will have almost been wiped out, with only a few groups of survivors clinging to life near the poles (according to a recent report).\n\nAnd the government give the flying industry \u00a39 BILLION in tax breaks. That's enough to buy over 30 new hospitals, build 2,000 new schools, put at least 450,000 new police on the beat, and pay the tuition fees of over 3 million students!\n\nMost flights, especially short haul flights, are completely unnessecary.\nTaking the train is ten times better for the environment.\n\nplease don't destroy our planet",
