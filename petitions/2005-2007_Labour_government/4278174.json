Cat has neither the personality, nor charm, to carry off the show, which was previously enjoyable.\n\nCat is apparantly also in talks to host X-Factor. Please spare us.\n\nCat is perfect for an American audience. Need we say more. So please spare the UK audience this unfortunate turn of events, which threatens to destroy family entertainment as we know it.",
