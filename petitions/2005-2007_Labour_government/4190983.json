Does the Prime Minister or the Chancellor have any idea how difficult it is to pay a mortgage, all household bills, council tax, road taxes etc., etc., on a salary of \u00a320,000?  If we want a holiday we have to pay a single supplement.  So let's have more help for those of us who've worked since leaving college 26 years ago, have never had time off and have always paid our taxes etc.  Could we please have our taxes lowered to thank us for paying our way?",
