In view of this all MPs of the present Government together with all civil servants and public bodies with the exception of the emergency services should be restricted to using vehicles that emit less than 130g of CO2. They should not be allowed to tell us what to do and then be hypercritical and do the opposite. I.E. No more 4x4 for the Prime Minister or Jags for the deputy PM",
