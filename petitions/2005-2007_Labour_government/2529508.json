Christmas banned by some councils, school children not allowed to play tag in case then touch each other, snowball fights banned in case of injury. I enjoyed Christmas, played tag and love the snow, I'm still here, so wheres the harm? Scrap all this legislation, afterall, we all live here in this great country and it is ruining peoples lives.",
