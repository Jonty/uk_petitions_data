But that is only for people that have been put in for \"higher\" tier.\n\nBut for those who are injustly put in for \"foundation\" tier they will never get a A as it is impossible, the highest they will get is a C.\n\nNow think about how much better students will do if the system changes and all students will have an equal chance to achive the grades they want. \n\nFor in this country that boasts freedom and equal opportunities there are flaws and equal oppertunitys are non existent.",
