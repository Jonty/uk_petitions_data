Capturing this data to establish how big this problem is and to take positive action to ensure that at the very least public awareness is raised. Growing anecdotal evidence suggests that an un-quantified percentage of the population experiences varying degrees of health impact after consuming certain additives.",

        "background": "Government scientists have recognised that susceptible people have adverse health reactions to certain additives i.e. Sodium Metabisulphite E223 is known to trigger severe asthmatic reactions in some people, Aspartame E951 is known to be a danger to people suffering a certain genetic condition - Phenylketonuria. No one seems to know exactly what this situation is. The public surely at least deserve warnings on products containing the 60 or so additives known or suspected of carrying side effects?",
