            "background": "The wearing of shellsuits has become the default uniform of many teenagers (and lazy people), removing the ability to think for themselves and express any kind of individuality through their dress. We are creating a country of drones. Besides which, shellsuits are just plain awful - nobody looks good in a shellsuit. I don't think it goes to far to say that there's a direct correlation between crime, the appearance of \"Boozebuster\" shops and the wearing of shellsuits.",
