            "background": "LA's are finding it very difficult to adequately fund enough Social Workers and a lot of young people are slipping through the net. Once in the system the Social Workers are unable to cope with the heavy workloads and each child is not given adequate attention.  This makes the situation difficult for families who are trying to work with Social Services to facilitate a return to the family for the young person in care. I would also like to see earlier intervention to prevent some cases from ever getting that far.",
