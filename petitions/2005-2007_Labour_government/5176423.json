            "background": "We have all seen the rise in recent years of drunken underage teenagers and the chaos they create in the community. We feel that access to alcohol should be much more strictly regulated starting with the banning of off sales at supermarkets and corner shops. This to be further reinforced by making entry into wine merchants illegal for under 18's and pubs and clubs to be returned to shorter opening hours with if necessary council regulated prices to prevent \"happy hours\" and other such promotions that encourage excessive consumption.",
