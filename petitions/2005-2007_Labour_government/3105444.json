            "background": "Over the years, the cost of low-energy light bulbs has fallen to the point that the total cost of ownership over just 12 months is now lower than using traditional incandescent lighting.\n\nDespite this, people still buy incandescent bulbs - out of habit.\n\nThis petition calls for the UK to follow a recent decision in Australia to slowly ban the sale of incandescent light bulbs by 2010.\n\nThe incandescent light bulb is a hugely inefficient way of lighting a room - and switching to low energy lighting will make a significant impact on the UK's carbon emissions - and it will do so AT NO COST to the consumer.",
