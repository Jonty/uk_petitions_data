I feel it is an embarrassment and portrays our country in the worst possible way. \n\nThe original London 2012 Logo was better by far. We need a new logo now, or at least a return to the old one!\n\nI should add I am proud and excited about the Olympics coming to London, and the UK, and it is for that very reason we need to get this terrible logo dropped as soon as possible.",
