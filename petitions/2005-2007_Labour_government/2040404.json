Instead of doing nothing at home, people should have to do community type of work,  public gardens ,  help with elderly,  anything .  A fortune could be saved by local govements and authorities, and small business's.\n Instead of 1000's of people sat idle they should ahve to work voluntary,  I feel it would get people of there backsides and if they didn't like the job they were given,  they might search themselves a little bit more to find something they prefer,  if they don't work, top payments",
