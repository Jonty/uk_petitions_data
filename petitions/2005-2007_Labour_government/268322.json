            "background": "The advent of devolution for Scotland and Wales gives us the anomalous situation, dubbed the 'West Lothian Question' by Scottish Labour MP Tam Dalyell, whereby English-constituency MPs will not be able to vote on matters devolved to Scotland, but Scottish-constituency MPs will be able to vote on these matters for England.  Furthermore Scottish-constituency MPs can vote on English only matters safe in the knowledge they will have no effect on their constituents.\n\nThis last point would be compounded if we had a PM with a Scottish constituency.\n\nLegislation for the creation of foundation hospitals in England, and to introduce university top-up fees was passed only due to Scottish MPs voting in favour. The majority of English MPs voted against.  The Scottish Parliament made its own decisions on the same matters.\n\nThe simplest solution, given the continued existence of a Scottish parliament, would be to prevent Scottish-constituency MPs voting on English only matters.",
