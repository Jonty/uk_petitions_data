Any private institution, public body or ordinary member of the public has to then pay a high price to use this information and to obey draconian restrictions on use.  I believe that this situation is detremental to innovation and efficiency in many industries and to academic projects and that such information should be provided as a free public service. I believe the most that could be justifiably charged is the publishing cost of paper-based products and that digital downloads should be freely available.",
