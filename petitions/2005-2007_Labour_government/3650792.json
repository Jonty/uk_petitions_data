            "background": "if the public is allowed access to foreshore areas they are at risk of being injured by shot and falling birds. they also pose a risk to the shooters themselves and could lead to a rise in complaints against the shooting community. this would lead to bad press which will further harm wildfowlers reputation. there would also be a huge impact on the natural enviroment and eco systems which are vital to the foreshore and inland areas. the public would cause unecessary disruption to feeding and nesting habits and any litter left behind by inconsiderate individuals could seriously injure fowl and create an eyesore for all visitors. protecting these foreshores is in the vital interest to the whole nation to protect bird species and the natural enviroment and also to protect the public from unecassery harm due to dangers such as quick sand and changing tides.",
