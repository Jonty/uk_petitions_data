            "background": "This is insulting to the majority of benefits claimants who are genuine. They work and pay taxes, so have a right to help from the state when they need it, usually through no fault of their own. I suspect that human beings can detect fraudulent claimants far better than a machine can. Lie detectors are not 100% accurate, as they simply detect stress, so they can give false positives, for example, if someone is having a stressful day (or upset that they need to claim benefits). This will only deter genuine claimants; fraudulent ones can lie convincingly and pass.",
