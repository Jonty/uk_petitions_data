            "background": "For more than ten years the British government has refused to ban new\ninvestment in Burma, despite repeated requests from Burma\u00b9s democracy\nmovement. The regime in Burma has used foreign investment to double the size\nof the army, reinforcing its grip on power, while ordinary people have\nbecome poorer.\n\n\nTherefore I urge The government  immediately ban new investment in Burma via the BritishVirgin Islands and other Overseas Territories. (The government can do this using a mechanism called a Queens Order in Council)\n\nAlso ask the Prime Minister to introduce legislation that will also enable the\ngovernment to ban British companies from investing in Burma (Labour is the\nonly major political party in the UK that does not support a unilateral\ninvestment ban).",
