We, the undersigned, petition the Prime Minister to introduce a ban on prams in coffee shops, not only to protect the peaceful environment required by so many of us, but also to reduce the number of pram-related ankle injuries suffered by non-pram driving patrons of these establishments (and consequently reducing the load on the NHS A&E departments).",
