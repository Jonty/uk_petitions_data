        "background": "The peacefulness off our high-street coffee shops has been destroyed by pram-weilding individuals who insist on pushing their prams down every narrow aisle in the coffee shop, causing disruption and injury (pram \"hit-and-run\" incidents).  We, the undersigned, petition the Prime Minister to introduce a ban on prams in coffee shops, not only to protect the peaceful environment required by so many of us, but also to reduce the number of pram-related ankle injuries suffered by non-pram driving patrons of these establishments (and consequently reducing the load on the NHS A&E departments).",
