            "background": "The stem-cell research area is clearly one where the British tradition in research and innovation gives us a starting advantage. Too often, we have surrendered such advantages to the US by being slow on the uptake or slow to maximise returns from such developments.\n\nNow we understand the UK government is unable to provide a stamp of quality which would underpin and add value to the work produced by stem-cell research laboratories. Apparently the US is already geared up for this and moving ahead down this path.\n\nSurely this area is important enough to future UK productivity to quickly move funds from another area or, better, pre-allocate some funds for use now from next years budget ?\n\nWhere there is a will, there is a way. This is clearly an area where investment now is vital to future ability to compete in the global economy.\n\nPlease make every effort to ascribe funds and priorities immediately so that the relevant government department(s) can start to underwrite this important activity.",
