        "background": "I feel that many of these magazines result in problems that we are facing today.  They give out false information and dumb down the nation by showing us nothing but negativity.  Our children read them and then base their life ambition on being like someone who was in them.  It shows us nothing but CELEBRITIES who are supposed to set an example, do the complete opposite!  We are paying for them to do that!  Due to this I feel we have lost who we are and who we aspire to be as individuals.  This is why I feel gossip magazines should be withdrawn.",
