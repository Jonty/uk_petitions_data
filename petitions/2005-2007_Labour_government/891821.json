These trucks contribute to damage to both the roads and the environment, with any repair costs being forced on us, the tax payer. I propose that any vehicle not carrying a UK Tax Disc, is subject to pay a toll on entry into the UK. The French do it, the Germans too, so lets get some contribution back into the UK!!",
