        "background": "The government has this week gone against the recomendations of the Pay Reveiw Body and has insulted our nurses by offering them a 1.9% pay rise. To add insult to injury the government has staged this pay rise robbing nurses of what is rightly their's.\nThere is much protest over this decision and therfore would like your support in overturning the governments offer and force them to offer the recomended 2.5%. Afterall we all use the NHS and come into contact with our nurses at some point so please dont allow this government to destroy our NHS by forcing nurses to look elsewhere for appropriately paid employment.",
