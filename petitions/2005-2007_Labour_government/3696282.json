            "background": "Relationship breakdown, be it marriage or any other form of relationship is difficult, especially when children are involved. \n\nIn these cases it is almost impossible for parents to make dispassionate and sensible decisions with respect to their children. It is often more important to the individuals involved in the relationship breakdown to hurt each other, rather than resolve issues.\n\nChildren and their access are effectively used as weapons to hurt the other party.\n\nWe need a compulsory structure in place where ex. partners are encouraged, in a positive environment, to make proper provisions for care both financially and emotionally of their children.\n\nPlease join me then, by signing this petition to make mediation compulsory in the event of relationship breakdown where children are involved.",
