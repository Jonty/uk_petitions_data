He became assistant manager of Everton in 1981 at the same time that Howard Kendall became manager. He held this position during Everton's highly successful years in the mid 1980's (two Championships, FA Cup and a European Cup Winners' Cup). \n\nHarvey was appointed manager of Everton in June 1987 after the departure of Howard Kendall. Harvey's time as manager ended in October 1990 but six days later he was appointed assistant manager by the returning Kendall. Harvey left Everton when Kendall departed in 1993 but returned as youth team coach in 1997. He retired in June 2003 due to an ongoing hip injury.",
