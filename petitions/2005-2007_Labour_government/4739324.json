        "background": "Given recent world events, I submit that the ability of the ruling party to hold it's own Prime Ministerial elections is undemocratic.  During the tenure of Tony Blair's leadership, the role of Prime Minister has become 'statesman like'.  Tony Blair's word on the world stage is held in similar esteem to that of the US president and as such repercussions can be great.  In light of this it is undemocratic to allow the role of Prime Minister to change hands without a referendum of the people.  The people should decide who is to lead the country.",
