            "background": "If a 60 year old was being paid less than a 30 year old, for doing the same job, then that is regarded as age discrimination, which if I\u2019m right in saying, is illegal in the U.K?\nSo why is it permitted for an 18 year old to be paid less than a 30 year old, for doing the same job?\nIt is exploitation, wrong, and discrimination against young people, this ruling needs to change. We have had enough of being used as cheap labour.\nWe demand that you abolish the age restrictions on the payment of the minimum wage, and ensure that age discrimination does not affect the young, elderly, or middle aged. We firmly believe that everyone should be entitled to equal pay for doing the same job, whether or not your 17, 34, or 65. Please change this ruling, it's unfair.",
