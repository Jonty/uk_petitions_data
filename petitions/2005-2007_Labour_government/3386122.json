        "background": "Give back authority and respect to teachers.  Re-introduce caning at our schools across Britain.\n\nGive parents the right to discipline their children as well using corporal punishment.\n\nIntroduce caning to the judiciary system so that caning can be meted out as part of the sentencing procedures on youth and the youth too young to be dealt with in other ways.\n\nChildren in Britain have lost all respect for authority and their elders, re-introducing caning and corporal punishment will greatly assist in restoring our youth to a more respectful manner of behaviour.",
