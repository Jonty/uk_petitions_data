            "background": "The NHS is still in dire need of money and we are constantly being told of newly developed drugs which are approved by NICE yet are then refused to patient because of lack of funds.\nI have inoperable prostate cancer\nMy hormone treatment has failed and an MRI scan was recommended. The only MRI scanner suitable was one of two new privately run units recently inported from the USA.  In order to get my scan I had to pay nearly \u00a3500 myself.\nA new drug has come on to the market recently which shows good results in the control of Prostate Cancer but this costs approx \u00a37000 to treat someone and so it has now become a postcode lottery to get treatment.\nI have paid taxes for 40 years as well as National Insurance and now find that I should really have kept my taxes back to pay for private treatments.\n\nFUND THE NHS PROPERLY FROM THE LOTTERY AND STOP GIVING MONEY TO OPERA HOUSES AND DOME BUILDERS and other projects that waste our taxes whilst I am dying.",
