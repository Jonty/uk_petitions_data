            "background": "There are occasions when we wish to go to local shops to make a quick purchase or to carry out tasks. Recent examples I can think of are: buy a paper, pick up dry cleaning, deposit money at the bank, pick up contact lenses, buy household essentials such as milk, bread, etc. \n\nIt\u2019s marvellous that we have so many parking spaces in town so that we can park in peace and without blocking traffic. However, it\u2019s disgraceful that we have to pay, sometimes up to 60p, to stop for reasons such as those above which may take 5 or 10 minutes, sometimes less.\n\nThese tasks enable us to get on with our everyday lives, to earn a living and help to keep local trades people in business. As far as I can see local councils are using this as a means of extracting money from us as a captive audience. \n\nIf we need to park for a more prolonged period of time then certainly charge us a premium for that privilege. But please, not for such short, everyday, essential stops.",
