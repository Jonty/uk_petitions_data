        "background": "In light of the governments move to allow the teaching of intelligent design in shools, I feel we should open the flood gates to other equally pseudoscientific ideas.\nAstrology is an ancient tradition which has been followed by millions of people for centuries.\nEvery day millions of people throughout the world consult the astrology section of their newspapers for guidance.\nThe fact that astrology is so widely accepted by the public is not represented in the curriculum of our schools.\nI therefore urge that astrology and other widely held pseudoscientific ideas \nbe made a mandatory part of the school curriculum.",
