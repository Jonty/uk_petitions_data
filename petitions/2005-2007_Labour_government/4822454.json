It seems were only scared of America if we do anything without asking for their permission. Innocent lives of soldiers and their families pain can be felt throughout the whole uk. Nothing will be be sorted there, the only best idea is to leave the country to sort themselves out, as their bringing in new weapons and ammunitions ie: shaped charges, which damaged our Challenger 2 tank which is the British Armys best weapon, if they can damage that then who knows what they will do next.",
