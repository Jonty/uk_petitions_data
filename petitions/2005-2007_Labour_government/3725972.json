            "background": "In many countries such as Germany, the legal age for buying alcoholic drinks is 16, and this has had no bad effects - in fact in Britain, due to the high age limit, teenagers are compelled to binge drink in order to make the most of whenever they can get alcohol from others or illegally.  Lowering the age limit would reduce the amount of binge drinking and would align Britain more with Europe and less with the unsavoury USA.  The recent change to smoking laws are another part of the obvious changes our government is making in order to make us the 51st state.",
