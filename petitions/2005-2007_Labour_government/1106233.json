It, or the fear of it, does not require the detention or punishment of people who have not been convicted of any crime; indeed such laws damage the Nation more than the terrorism itself.\n\nThe same is the case with ASBOs, SCBOs and other, pseudo-civil, measures which deliver criminal punishments without criminal convictions.\n\nWe must return to the theory of the Bill of Rights of no conviction or threat of fine or other punishment without due conviction by a jury.",
