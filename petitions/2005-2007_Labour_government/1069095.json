If this country is not a racist country, let us rid ourselves of the religious (firmly held belief) filth of Darwins teachings!  Do not teach his arrogant and UNSCIENTIFIC theology (his god was himself) in our schools and misname it as \"science.\"  \nIf we teach Evolution, we should teach other (and more plauseable possibilities - i.e. Intelligen Design) beliefs.  \n\nLet us not forget that \"race\" is a made-up concept anyway.  We should run away at full speed from any thing that has encouraged the actions of Adolf Hitler!",
