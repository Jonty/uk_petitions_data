            "background": "Despite millions of people saying NO to road pricing as a means of easing congestion, government continues to insist it is necessary to introduce extra tax and tracking. At the same time congestion is deliberately created by government policy. A major cause is road works, often un-manned. All contracts placed for road works should insist on 24/7 manning, with fines for contravention, and the earliest possible completion. Roads should be engineered for maximum traffic flow, not narrowed with empty bus lanes or festooned with un-necessary traffic lights.",
