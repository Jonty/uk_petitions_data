            "background": "Earth's 4.5 billion year history is one long story of climate change. This fact is pretty much accepted by those who think global warming is a natural process, and those who think it's caused by man.\n\nIn more recent history there has been: a mini ice age in the seventeenth century when the Thames froze so solidly that fairs could regularly be held on the ice; a Medieval Warm Period, even balmier than today; and sunnier still was the so-called Holocene Maximum, which was the warmest period in the last 10,000 years.\n\nEarth's climate has already undergone many dramatic swings and this was long before we created technologies capable of altering the atmosphere. We need to fully appreciate this picture in order to put global warming (or cooling) predictions into perspective and to understand the degree to which we humans may be the cause.",
