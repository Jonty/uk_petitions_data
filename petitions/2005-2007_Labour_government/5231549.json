            "background": "Working women who choose to have a family are positively discriminated against versus those women who choose not to have children and work all their lives. Employers see pregnant women as 'untouchable'where sickness/lateness is concerned. Women who choose to have children are allowed paid time off work during their maternity leave.\nWomen who choose not to have children, spend most of their lives in industry and have far less time off sick receive no benefits whatsoever.\nIf a woman decides to have a family, she does it knowing full well that there may be health issues along the way - why then should they be treated any differently when taking time off work sick than a woman who is not pregnant?Why should they be treated any differently if they arrive late for work because they feel unwell ? \nA full review of this situation is called for to redress the balance.",
