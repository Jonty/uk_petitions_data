        "background": "Half of the Souths transport budget is paying for the much needed road improvements on A3 Hindhead. But this is pulling away much needed funds to improve the traffic congestion of Gosport, Hants. Gosport is becoming a densily populated town due to its locality to Portsmouth and cost effective housing. I want government to halt further house building to prevent further increase in road traffic and extra pressure on local services.",
