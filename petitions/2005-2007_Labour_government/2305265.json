        "background": "Private hospitals in the UK are allowed to operate without having, on site, emergency facilities to cater for any emergency which arises while they are treating their patients outside the NHS.  Private hospitals, when they have an emergency, merely dial 999 and request an ambulance to take the patient to the nearest A & E Department.  Because of this anomaly the true cost of private medical treatment is being borne, mainly, by the UK taxpayer through the NHS.",
