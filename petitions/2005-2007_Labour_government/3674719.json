        "background": "I believe that the EMA system is unfair, payments of \u00a330 a week is very generous for students, however those who only recieve \u00a310 is not enough. With travel and food costs, as well as books and other educational materials the money doesnt stretch. Those students whos step parents bring up the household income are not likely to give the child in question money as they are not there responsilblity. They should not be accounted for.",
