            "background": "I submit this petition on the grounds that this is a serious and immediate risk to public safety. \n\nCurrently, you may browse eBay and browse a wide variety of knives for sale, from swords, to hunting knives, flick knives and even military knives. The potential this offers for an individual to purchase an offensive weapon is huge, and it is quite frankly astonishing that such items can be bought and sold in an online marketplace.\n\nThere are a number of potentially lethal weapons available on eBay, and action needs to be taken fast to prevent these weapons from entering circulation in the wrong hands throughout the UK.\n\nAt present, any individual regardless of age may register for an eBay account without any check being made as to their age or proof of address; even so, the purchase of a large hunting knife by an unidentified individual is still a very dangerous risk. Therefore the only way forward would be to prohibit all sales of knives and such potential weapons within online marketplaces.",
