            "background": "The petition referred to suggests that unemployed people should work in the community, and be paid for that, rather than receiving Unemployment Benefit (U.B).  In order to be eligible for U.B. one has to be available for work; if one is working in the community they can't be can they?  More generally (and more importantly) many petition creators seem to think that all, or most, people receiving U.B. are lazy and \"work-shy\"; maybe some are but, for the majority, problems can include being the wrong age (or even personality; however relevant, or otherwise, for the specific vacancy!).  Other issues can be that there are no jobs for which one has the qualifications or experience; just because there are, say, 100 vacancies in a specific area, and 100 people on the unemployment register, it does not therefore necessarily follow that the 100 unemployed INDIVIDUALS are suitable for the 100 vacancies.",
