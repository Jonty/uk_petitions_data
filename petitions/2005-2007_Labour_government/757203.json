            "background": "This tax will hit the non-commercial boat industry hard. The price of fuel in the UK is set to more than double some time in the next year, inline with what Europe calls 'harmonisation', the net effect being that marine diesel will be the most expensive in Europe. We are an island nation, and this will affect many members of the nautical community more than in other nations, which do not even have a coatline.",
