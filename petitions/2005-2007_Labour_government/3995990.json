            "background": "The European Union created a directive that came into force last October. It has standardised measurements across the EU meaning that the famous Crown stamp is prohibited on glasses - a tradition dating back to 1699. It is also now illegal to place the Crown stamp alongside the CE (Conformite Europeene) certification. This petition seeks to revoke this undemocratic and unnecessary interference into British tradition.",
