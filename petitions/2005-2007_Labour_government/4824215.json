            "background": "Many young offenders have no respect, pride, morals or work ethics.\nThis petition is to ask that, if young offenders are caught and convicted on more than one occasion they should automatically be given a 6 month 'sentence' to an Army Training Centre specifically designed and set up for the purposes of discipline, and of giving young offenders the opportunity to reverse these negative and destructive trends in their lives.\n\nIt has been proved time and again that, if youngsters become part of a functional group and are given back pride in what they do in a controlled environment, they re-evaluate their lives in a positive way.",
