            "background": "From the Think 21 website : Think 21 is an attempt to reduce the instances of age restricted products being sold to underage people. Through the campaign, retailers can refuse to sell age restricted products to anyone who appears to be 21 years old and does not have an acceptable form of photo identification.\n--------------------------\nTHIS CANNOT BE RIGHT ! However well intentioned !!! If you are 18..20 years of age and going about your lawful business of purchasing a can of beer...to be challenged and potentially refused service because you look 'Under 21' ie: not 'Under 18' is fundamentally wrong. Either change the law so alcohol cannot be bought by under 21's and EVERYONE has to prove their age or stop this ridiculous practice.",
