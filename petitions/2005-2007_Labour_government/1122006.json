            "background": "The city council are proposing to introduce road tolls by 2012 in Manchester and on many of the busiest routes into Manchester.  The current congestion in Manchester is actually due to the de-regulated bus companies over loading some routes and stops, additionaly we have a tram system which is inadequate and already fails to cope with the peak traffic.  Many people who drive do so as they have no real cost or 'family time' viable alternative and a toll is simply exploiting this rather than solving a real problem.",
