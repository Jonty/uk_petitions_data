            "background": "Petition to the prime minister to implement punitive fines for lying to and/or misleading the General Public, or failure to implement and fully uphold the principals and tenets of the Ministerial and Civil Service Codes of conduct. Fines will be levied for incompetence, (ie: departments and other public bodies not considered \u201cFit for Purpose\u201d) or having a \u201cHardened attitude towards the General Public\u201d, punitive fines applied throughout the management structure of the organisation, government department, responsible ministers, prime minister and political party. The purpose of this petition is to restore the balance of democracy, eradicate an undemocratic, arrogant and defiant culture, and cause Ministers and Civil Servants to take responsibility for their actions. A Government (and Political Party) may naturally become extinct through compensating the Electorate by paying for its mistakes through the imposition of fines.",
