        "background": "Motorcycle riders are subject to age  and experience restrictions when riding bikes of increasing power. I propose that the same should be applied to drivers of cars. For example; no driver below the age of 19yrs, or with less than 2 years qualified driving experience, should be allowed to drive a vehicle with an engine capacity greater than 1.2 litres etc. As the vast majority of vehicles on the roads are cars, this would help reduce the number of accidents caused by or involving drivers driving cars beyond their experience or ability.",
