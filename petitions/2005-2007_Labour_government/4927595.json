        "background": "The recent climbdown over forced metrication in the UK makes the persecution and conviction of Steve Thoburn, simply for giving his customers the choice of buying fruit by the pound or the kilo, even more unjust than before. \n\nThis petition acknowledges that Steve, rightly dubbed a \"metric martyr,\" died an innocent man, having committed no real \"crime\" at all. \n\nWe call for this to be formally acknowledged by posthumous pardon.",
