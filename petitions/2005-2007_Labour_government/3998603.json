This can be harmles but we should all be aware that people are often not who they appear to be.\nI appeal to the Prime Minister to introduce emergency legislation so that all people logging into any chat room must produce proof of age/address etc. Although not foolproof, I believe this would be a step in the right direction. \nAlso, the maximum penalty for online 'grooming' should be increased dramatically.",
