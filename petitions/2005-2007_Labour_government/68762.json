It is a significant waste of energy. \n\nThe Energy Saving Trust is asking us to cut down on our energy use by 20%, yet private companies and government still waste significant amounts of energy on floodlighting buildings. Why should our taxes pay to floodlight government buildings?\n\nThe Government must ban the floodlighting of buildings. Even before legislation is introduced, the government could set a lead in this to encourange private owners by switching off the floodlighting of government buildings.",
