            "background": "The current Cadet Forces , Army, Air and Sea cadets turn out well rounded young men and women. \n\nMake it a compulsory part of the school curriculum, this will go far to aiding in the teaching of discipline among the youth resulting in them having a healthy respect for authority, themselves and those around them.\n\nThe cost of this training would be more than outweighed by the reduction in crime and vandalism early training would bring.  \n\nThe youth would be far better turned out and behaved for having had cadet training at school.  The rewards to be gained far outweigh any costs involved in setting this up and keeping it going.",
