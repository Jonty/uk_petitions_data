            "background": "We are very concerned about the persecution of the Mandaean community in Iraq. Theirs is a small and unobtrusive religion of impressive literary accomplishments. History shows they flourish economically and educationally when left to themselves and survive horrendous persecution at other times, but it is possible they will not make it this time. While no one is responsible for the actions of Islamic fundamentalists except themselves, the people and democratically elected government of the UK must shoulder much of the responsibility for the anarchy in Iraq which has allowed the Islamists to run wild. It is in the interests of humanity to preserve endangered religions, as well as endangered species or endangered languages. The Mandaeans are an important example to learn from, since they have practised peace as well as preached it for all the centuries they are known to have existed. We ask that you offer all Mandaeans living in Iraq airfare to London and a British passport on arrival.",
