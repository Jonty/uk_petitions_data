Creating such posts is an urgent priority.\n\nAt least \u00a32bn has been invested in 8,000 young doctors who now, because of a drastic shortage of training posts and what seems yet another failed planning process, are facing the prospect of having to leave the NHS altogether after at least eight years of work qualifying; not to mention years of accumulated student debt. \n\nThese junior doctors represent the best young minds of their generation. It is heartbreaking to see such bright young people being forced to consider leaving their career and country. These young doctors need to have sufficient training posts and future career prospects created within the NHS.",
