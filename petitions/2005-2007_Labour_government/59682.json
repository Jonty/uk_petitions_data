            "background": "While no conventional threat such as the Soviet Union remains, the American domination of the international system will not last forever; who knows what adversary will arise in forty years time, in an anarchical international system it is best to have the insurance of nuclear weapons. \n  Nuclear expenditure in Britain only accounts for 5% of the defence budget, a tiny cost for the world\u2019s most effective insurance policy. A disarmament program would be nothing more than a grand political gesture with no real impact upon the proliferation of nuclear weapons. \u201cIt may be unpleasant but it is an unpleasant necessity\u201d.  Idealism is yet to prosper in an international system that is as anarchical as ever, unpredictable events such as September the 11th attacks means that Britain\u2019s nuclear arsenal remains an important insurance policy.",
