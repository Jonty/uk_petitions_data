            "background": "Nanotechnology is currently used in beauty products. Food manufacturers now want to add it to food. these chemicals behave differently to their normal versions. Harmless chemicals can become poisonous at these small sizes. There has been little testing of their long term effects. In the US food manufacturers do not have to inform people of their use in food. I would like to know if they are in food so that I can avoid them. \nIf they are released into the environment through their use, what is to stop them getting into the food chain. We are currently causing huge problems to the environment. Haven't we learned anything? Why are we again releasing untested chemicals into it?",
