            "background": "Beatboxing is the art of recreating all instruments and sound effects with your mouth. As part of hiphop and urban culture it is respected by young people more than classical musical forms. It requires no equipment and teaches coordination, confidence and teamwork. Music tuition has been proven time and time again to expand the minds of young people and assist their other studies. Beatboxing is simple to teach and to learn, there are hundreds of beatboxers across the country ready to demonstrate, and there are many tutorials, videos and audio samples available on the internet.",
