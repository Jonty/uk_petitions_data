The SA80 assualt rifle, a total waste of money, but there is no cash to replace it and so it will be in service for another ten years. They drive along the bomb laden streets of Basra in soft skinned Land Rovers that offer about as much protection from an AK47 round as a napkin. Surely our soldiers deserve better.",
