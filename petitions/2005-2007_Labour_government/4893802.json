            "background": "at present,parents of multiples have to fold up their prams to get onto london buses. bus drivers are no longer able to allow double-buggies through the back doors. parents are now being told that this is a fire hazard.It is becoming increasingly difficult to travel on public transport because of this,and parents are finding that they are forced to add pollution to the environment and take driving lessons to enable them to travel.often parents may have a disabled twin e.g on oxygen as a result of prematurity(as a high proportion of multiples are born quite early),or are a single parent with no help and there is nobody to help them get onto a bus.Many parents find that they stay in the local area beause of this and it can make parents feel isolated.It is a kind of discrimination. Why is it fair that two single prams are allowed on but not a double which is the equivilant of just that??",
