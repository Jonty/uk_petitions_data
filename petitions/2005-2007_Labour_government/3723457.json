            "background": "artists are continually being exploited by \nwriting songs for producers, record companies, film directors etc when asked to write music as a \"work for hire\", where all copyright lies with the person who asked for the music. the artist then has no rights whatsoever in how that music will be used. they also have to ask for permission if they wish to play their own music, this is unnacceptable, the artist should keep 50% of the copyright and a separate contract can be made to determine how both parties can use the music.",
