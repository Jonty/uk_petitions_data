However, it is still possible that the City of Nottingham Council will expand taking in all or parts of Gedling, Broxtowe, Ashfield and Rushcliffe.  These areas are already paying for Nottingham's problems via the high cost of Notts police. The advent of an expanded City will only make this worse.",
