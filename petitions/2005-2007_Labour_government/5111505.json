        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In many areas of the country local councils are providing incentive schemes for parents to try cloth nappies on their babies.  This is for the benefit of the local councils as disposable nappies make up 15% of household waste.  However, it is a postcode lottery.  Some areas have fantastic incentive schemes providing trial kits and money-off coupons, while other councils provide absolutely no incentive scheme at all.  If the UK as a whole is expected to reduce the waste sent to landfill, then surely the UK as a whole should have the same incentive scheme for parents to try cloth nappies.  Not everyone can afford the initial outlay of buying cloth nappies, despite the huge overall cost-saving.  These incentive schemes are therefore essential in helping families to begin using cloth nappies.",
