            "background": "Bring in tax breaks for 2 parent families to help make the very important decision for one parent to stay at home and bring up the child(ren) WITHOUT claiming benefits.  Stay at home parents provide an essential service and lay the foundations for the future behaviour of our children.  If more parents were able to stay at home, then perhaps we can start putting a stop to anti-social behaviour. Anyone else see the correllation between the lack of stay at home parenting and anti-social behaviour?  Stay at home parents are NOT a burden on society as we do NOT claim benefits.  We choose to have children for ourselves, not to pass onto a nursery or childminder!! Many parents are not able to make this choice because the cost of living in this country is disproportionate. Give us the ABILITY to make that choice between staying at home and not by introducing tax breaks.",
