            "background": "Introduce set licencing and legislation in place for companys who run limo's.\nLimo's currently licenced as private hire cars or minibuses as there are no rules/guidlines that fit them exactly which leads to a big grey area as to what you can and can't do when driving them.\nI propose that licencing is set for capacity, limited alcohol retail, requirements for drivers and details on what permits are needed for limited access roads.",
