            "background": "Around 70,000 pensioners are not receiving free nursing home care because of the Government's means-testing.  Means-testing discourages work and saving and is unacceptable in the 21st century \"global\" economy.  All fees for nursing care should be scrapped and elderly people should no longer have to sell their homes to pay for care.  The cost would only be about \u00a32.2 billion a year.",
