            "background": "Everyone has heard of the problems with Off Road Motorcycling in this country, week in week out we hear about police forces and neighbourhood community groups spending money 'Cracking Down' on illegal off road mototcycling. How about some of the money that is being spent trying to stop it is used to create designated areas for riding and/or given to local clubs already running with they're own land arrangements  to promote SAFE off road riding away from built up areas where noise and traffic is a problem. The problem with illegal off road riding will not go away with metal gates and police helicopters all it will do is force more illegal riders onto public highways, the idea to create areas where a controlled environment can be used either through organised race meetings or practice areas seems the best option.",
