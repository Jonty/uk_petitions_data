        "background": "This country is turning into a dictatorship.  The media war against 4x4s is creating bad feelings against normal people who are just driving the car of their choice.  Drivers of 4x4s are being persecuted.\n\nBefore Gordon Brown starts charging me \u00a3400.00 tax on my 4x4 I would like absolute proof that by driving my 4x4 I am DESTROYING the planet.  Modern 4x4s are as low on emissions as other cars these days.\n\nThere is media frenzy about 4x4s emanating from London and the term \"Chelsea Tractors\".  I live in the Peak District (North of England) where it has snowed overnight (19 March 2007).  My 4x4 is not just used for driving the kids to school - it is a useful utility vehicle.  There may be climate change happening in central London but I can assure you it has not reached the North of England yet.  London based ministers should try venturing away from their little world in Parliament and visit North of Watford.\n\nAs I live in a democratic country I feel I have the right to drive whichever car I choose be it a Bentley, a Ford Focus, a Ferrari, a Mini, a Mercedes anything or a Toyota Landcruiser.  Freedom of Choice!",
