            "background": "I ask that people who give up hours of their time to work with children (or others) don't have to get subsequent CRB checks carried out for each organisation they work voluntarily for. I am now having to get my third CRB check in two years because each of the three organisations I represent as a volunteer will NOT accept a CRB check carried out by another. If the checks were centralised in some way then the administration would be cut down, as would costs. I also ask the Prime Minister to make it illegal for any administrative body, or National Sporting Organisations (such as Badminton England), to charge volunteer club coaches or other volunteer staff for these checks.",
