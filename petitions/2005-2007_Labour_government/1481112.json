        "action": "STOP the totally unnecessary and misguided merger of two of the UK's finest grammar schools in Boston Lincs, keep them separate and preserve a 500 year old history and a PAN of 264 - the potential loss of 100 places to strengthen local comprehensive school results is wrong! Why WEAKEN the STRONG to STRENGTHEN the WEAK?",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We want parental choice for ALL of Boston & region's existing and new Citizens from the EU & particularly Eastern Europe. Many immigrants have settled & increased Boston's population, validated by the CEO of the Borough. Children from ALL backgrounds must have access to an excellent ACADEMIC education from the SEPARATE Boys and Girls schools & preserve a 500 year old history and a PAN of 264. Boys must also have the best chance as the girls. The 11+ must be compulsory again - selective education has been PROVEN to work. Widely reported in 2006 - UK Business' are crying out for graduates with core business skills:- sciences/western languages/maths & english. The 164 grammar school results speak for themselves throughhout the UK. GRAMMARS GET RESULTS - They WORK. STOP destroying them, you must preserve and increase them. VOTE NO to this MERGER/FEDERATION in Boston - based on dubious VIEWS & incorrect trend data. Thank you for your support!",
