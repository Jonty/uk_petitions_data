        "background": "This name change will front a culture change from excessive alcohol consumption during the week to that involving Saturday imbibing.  \n\nBritain has a poor reputation for \"binge drinking\" and it has had a detrimental effect on the health of British people, as well our reputation abroad.  This measure will ensure that a more positive approach is adopted to weekend relaxation.\n\nWith the change from Saturday becoming Swallyday people will be able to plan their leisure and recreation events better.",
