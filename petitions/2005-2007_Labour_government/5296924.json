There will be no facility to produce emergency products in the East of the Pennines, from London to the Scottish borders. Amicus believes this will place patient\u2019s lives at risk. \nIn addition, nationally it appears that within the next four years around 50% of the NBS scientific and technical staff will face redundancy. There will be an overall reduction of 600 highly specialised staff.",
