        "background": "I alongside many others who I happen to know are extremely disappointed after having voted Labour and supported the Blair Government are quite frankly appalled at the lack of enquiry going into the tax credit system currently.We can't even address unfair policy in the courts because the tax people cannot be brought to court. Appalling.\nMany people are being freely given these tax credits after checking with the helpline and afterwards being told that they in actual fact have to pay back the money in thousands of pounds precisely when they are struggling to crawl out of the benefits trap.\nPlease please look into this MrBlair",
