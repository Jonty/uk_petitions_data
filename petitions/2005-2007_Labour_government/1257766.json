        "background": "Witchcraft and Wicca are vastly popular and growing religions not only in the UK, but across the world. They are peaceful and positive belief systems that are nature based. We ask the government to therefore afford their practitioners the same rights and protection from discrimination in the media, in education, the work place, armed forces, legal processes etc, as Christian religions currently enjoy. Our eight seasonal festivals including Samhain (Halloween), should be given the same status as Christian festivals. We would also ask that our marriage ceremony known as \u2018Handfasting\u2019 is legally recognised in England as part of this change in policy.",
