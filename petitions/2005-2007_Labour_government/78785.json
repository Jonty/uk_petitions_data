            "background": "The government has approved over 200 new road schemes which total over \u00a312 billion.  This includes \u00a33.7 billion to widen the M1, and \u00a31.6 billion to widen the M25.  Experience shows that the new road space will soon fill up and encourage more traffic growth.  This money would be better spent investing in measures that would cut traffic growth and CO2 emissions: better public transport and making cycling and walking more attractive.  These schemes are far better value for money, improve our quality of life, and  reduce CO2 emissions.",
