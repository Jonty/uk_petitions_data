            "background": "Now that the education authority has transfered a large number of physical disabled children in to mainstream school, almost all of these children get no access to suitable physical education. Parents like myself have to arrange  this at our/their expense in order to try and reduce the risk of our/their physical disabled child becoming overweight leading to other major health issues.Able bodied children have access to football, rugby and numerous other activity events during term and holiday time, at a very minimal cost and in most cases free because of legislation to get kids fit..What about kids in wheelchairs or walking on sticks or with frames dont they need to get keep fit. Local gyms are running sessions for able bodied kids, when they are clearly capable of playing or running around the track or field. Lets make sure we get rights for the less mobile of society, there not standing still by choice.",
