        "background": "We, the common people are being continually penalised for using our cars to commute to work. Public Transport is not always a feasible option due to unreliable services, limited timetables, lack of services in certain areas, costs, etc.  The people who impose these taxes can easily afford them so it makes no difference to them personally.  If they were made to rely on Public Transport as they expect us to do, then in a month or so's time, they may feel more sympathetic and scrap any further taxing on cars and make much needed improvements to public transport.",
