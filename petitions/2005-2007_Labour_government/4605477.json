            "background": "There are no subsidies for parent and child parking in towns and very little in carparks.  Extra space is needed to get young children in and out of car seats and it is an added danger having children squeezing out of spaces in between cars.  Badges are needed to stop people abusing the spaces as currently happens in supermarkets and town parking",
