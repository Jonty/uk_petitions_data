At present as a driver approaches the 70th birthday all that is required is a declaration that their health has not deteriated. I propose that all drivers should undergo a full eyesights check, which if passed successfully would be followed by a full medical.

This process would ensure that drivers were fit to drive and could drive in current traffic conditions to a safe standard.",
