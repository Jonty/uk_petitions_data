I have been continually and openly breaking this piece of legislative incompetance since it came into force by deliberately setting dogs after wild deer with the full knowledge of the police.\n\nPeople should be allowed to break all such absurd laws with impunity.  If they can't be enforced due to their ludicrous nature then you should have to change them.",
