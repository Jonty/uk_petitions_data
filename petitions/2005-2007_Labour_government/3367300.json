            "background": "Testicular cancer is a YOUNG man's and teen cancer. I run www.checkemlads.com with fellow young cancer survivors. We are unhappy that testicular cancer awareness is not being taken as serious in school's as Breast cancer.\n\nWe have been welcomed into army bases across the country and have had great feed back on our down to earth talks given by survivors in a young mans laid back manner.\n\nThis cancer is killing young men because it is stronger the younger the male is who has it. Breaking the embarrassment of \"testicles\" and fear of doctors at a young age could dramatically lower the chances of young men needing life saving chemotherapy or dying from testicular cancer when they need be.",
