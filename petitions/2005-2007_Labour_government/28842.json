        "background": "In 1991, VAT was increased from 15% to 17.5% to provide revenue for the \"Community Charge Reduction Scheme\" aimed at assisting local authorities suffering from the fall-out of massive levels of defaulting on the \"poll tax\" together with the costs of changing over to the council tax.  Surely the shortfall has now been covered and the original reason for the VAT increase is no longer valid, even though we're all still paying the increased VAT rate?",
