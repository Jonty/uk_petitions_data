            "background": "All houses built from January 2008 should be made to have solar panels or solar water heating fitted as part of the building regulations. This will have a number of beneficial effects, the cost of solar products will reduce as a mass market is created making it easier and cheaper for existing houses to upgrade. It will also make an immediate start to our global responsibilities. Finally, installing when the house is built will keep costs down and become a negligible amount of the overall house building cost.",
