            "background": "It is a nonsense, in the modern day, for the freedom to trade and the freedom to shop to be prevented annually due to a superstitious celebration. The restriction on shops opening on \"Easter Sunday\" should be lifted and, once this has been achieved, the liberation of all Sunday trading needs to follow. \n\nLet shop owners decide what is best for their business and let shoppers decide what they want to do with their time. Keep superstition out of public life and, in particular, out of the laws of the land.",
