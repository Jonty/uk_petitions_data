            "background": "The facts are more people are passing there driving tests and owning a car today then in the 1990s. And not taking into account the amount of driving experience they really have. May be enough to get them through a 30 min test. For new drivers it should be restricted for the safety of others and for the more experienced.Example new learner displaying a P plate and drives at 60mph a car overtakes he feels intimidated so he puts his foot down and wants to re-overtake. Not taking into account he has no experience if he looses control at high speeds. Thats one or more for the nhs. Im wanting to help limit new drivers to 1.0 ltr sized engines for one year to gain experience and safety and control.And also is eco freindly for the envioronment.",
