            "background": "Stop spending the money they do on building weapons of mass destruction and war, instead use the money to pay for students to get an higher education.  This will remove stress and worry about money for many students and their families who wish their child to succeed in life.  By investing in the future of the country and reducing the money spent on ending life, we could start something big that could influence other countries to follow what we are doing and bring us closer to peace with each other.",
