            "background": "Political correctness has led to members of RAF Bomber Command who took part in operations over occupied Europe and Germany being forgotten as the mass bombing campaign of that period is now considered unacceptable. These men were brave men who did their duty, and often died, for their country and have never been recognised. They should be awarded this Campaign Medal now before it is too late as it is too late for so many.",
