            "background": "Year after year the utility companies such as the water companies are increasing charges to customers well in excess of the rate of inflation whilst at the same time executives are awarding themselves obscene salary increases and giving share holders massive above inflation increases in their dividends. The principal of getting a fair return for investments, re-investing profits and running the business in a fair minded way is something the utility companies do not understand. Instead they prefer to reward themselves by overcharging customers exploiting the monopoly position they find themselves in. This has to stop as it is causing untold hardship in the communities they serve.",
