Implementing new govt policies since labour came into power and shaping the nhs for the future.The governments financial strategies are not only creating the  threat of job losses but the latest pay award is insulting and in effect a below inflation pay cut. this creates a wider disparity with other prfessions and undermines any effects of the new pay scales under agenda for change, that many staff are still waiting to be assimilated onto.Nurses and allied staff should have wage rises annually that reflect inflation.",
