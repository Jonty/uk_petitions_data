            "background": "Employment laws in the UK, state that if an Employee is sacked fairly or unfairly, under British Government policy, the Employee has to fund the full legal costs incurred in prosecuting the Employer.\n\nIf the Employee is found to be totally blameless, they are still penalised by having to pay all the legal costs incurred, this can quickly wipe out any compensation payment that they may have been awarded.\n\nBritish Government Policy restricts the amount of compensation that an Employment Tribunal can award to an innocent victim. \n\nThe employer who has broken the law does not have to pay the legal costs incurred by the innocent employee.\n\nI feel the system is totally corrupt and is designed to protect unscrupulous employers who have a total disregard for the law, it is also designed to prevent innocent victims from seeking justice and compensation through a British Court system.",
