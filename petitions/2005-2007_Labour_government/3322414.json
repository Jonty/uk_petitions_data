            "background": "The state does not have an automatic right to our biometric details. They belong to us. To assume a right of access to the very things that make us us is to deny our autonomy and our right to a functional privacy. It is a step towards establishing the very totalitarianism that they say they are attempting to defeat. To live in a truely free society is to take a risk that that freedom is exploited for evil purposes. Repression can not be defeated by instituting equally repressive measures. Our right to protect access to these details should be enshrined in law.",
