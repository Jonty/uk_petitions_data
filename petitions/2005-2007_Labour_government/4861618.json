            "background": "Petrol prices are increasing at an alarming rate, yet nobody seems to be doing anything about it. It isn't just the cost to the private user we need to think about but also the cost to business. When transport costs go up so does the price of everything else. It seems that the price of the petrol increase is unrelated to anything other than sheer greed on behalf of the large suppliers and retailers. Now is the time to act before these people have a rope around our necks. If we don't join together now and stand up for our self\u2019s now then big business will carry on making their massive profits at our expense.",
