        "background": "The Appleby horse fair is a barbaric event that takes place yearly.\nThe huge amount of people that attend seem beyond the law & outnumber the police officers by 1000:1 making the event virtually lawless.\nEach year horses are taken into the river & ducked three times & are clearly distressed by this process.\nHorses are also raced up & down the streets of Appleby with scant regard to public safety.\nThere are few arrests at the event as the police clearly fear a large scale riot would take place.\nWe request that the PM petition the Queen to remove the charter for this event.",
