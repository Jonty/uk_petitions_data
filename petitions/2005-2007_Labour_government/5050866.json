            "background": "GM crops have been grown commercially around the world for over a decade, and are now grown on over 100 million hectares worldwide. They have no proven ill effects and have reduced pesticide use, helping both farmers and the environment.\nIn the UK, however, pseudo-science spouted by so-called 'environmental' groups has led to British farmers missing out on the chance to benefit from these developments, and British companies being unable to develop GM crops.\nWorse still, the few field trials that are allowed are often destroyed by anti-GM activists who currently act with impunity. These vandals ought to be brought to justice.",
