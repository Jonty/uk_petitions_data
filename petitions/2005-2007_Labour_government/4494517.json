        "background": "World conditions are completely changed since the Beeching cuts were made.  Global warming is now the single most serious issue facing the human race.  Railways are the most efficient means of mechanical transport in terms of CO2 emission.  It is very desirable that many of the rail routes closed in former years should be re-instated as working railways to provide a safe and environmentally-friendly network covering the whole of the United Kingdom.  The present rail system is virtually full to bursting point, and whereas in the past a choice of routes was available for many journeys, (for example, London to Manchester), alternative routes have been closed, forcing all of the traffic onto one already-saturated route.",
