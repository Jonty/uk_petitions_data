So, a 5% increase in average earnings would trigger an increase in both pensions and MP's pay.  Conversly, an increase in pay to MP's of 20% would be followed by a similar increase in pension, and a tax cut to wage-earners to equate to a 20% increase.  Thereby, no sector could get too far ahead of the other, nor be left behind.",
