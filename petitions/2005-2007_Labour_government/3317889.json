            "background": "I used to believe mobile cameras were used as a deterent. during a recent case I found this not to be the case whatever. Depite having travelled to Australia and showing my Sister (who turned out to be the guilty party) the safety camera unit were in no way interested in prosecuting the right person. These units are dangerous, forcing people to brake sharply in often congested conditions. They cause more accidents than they prevent and are purely a money making scheme for local forces. The manpower would be better used policing the highways targetting such offenders as central lane hogs.",
