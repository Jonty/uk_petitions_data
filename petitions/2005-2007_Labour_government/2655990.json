        "background": "Motorists drive and park in cycle lanes because they are on the same level as the road. If they were 5cm above the road (the same level as the pavement) this would prevent motorists from driving / parking in the cycle lane.\n\nSince no one would walk on a pavement that was seperated from the road by a white strip, why should cyclists have to cycle under these conditions.",
