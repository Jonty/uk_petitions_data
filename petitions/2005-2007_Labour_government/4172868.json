            "background": "At present British citizens leaving the UK to live in the EU lose their UK voting rights after 15 years. Since the UK government has failed to negotiate reciprocal voting rights with all EU partners this means that UK citizens  lose their voting rights entirely. Freedom to live and work anywhere in the European Union is undermined by the removal of the franchise. The `15 year rule` should be suspended until the situation is fully resolved.",
