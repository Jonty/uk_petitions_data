        "background": "Legal immigrants (including spouses of UK citizens from outside the eu) already have to undergo a very tough visa procedure in thier country of origin and often have restrictions placed on thier ability to earn money once in the UK. They often have no access to any benefits for a period of time and have to pay the home office hundreds of pounds for the privilidge of being here and provide proof of earnings. If they want to gain citizenship they must pass an exam, pay yet more money and provide proof that they are paying for themselves. In many cases these people have been brought up in Britain's former colonies and share 'British' values. In many cases these people are professionals with families to support who by the time they obtain citizenship have already contributed 3 years tax.",
