        "background": "These are ludicrous ideas and I am fed up of cyclists being treated like second-class citizens. As a motorist and cyclist. I pay enough on extortionate road tax and insurance already. It is about time pedestrians stopped abusing cyclists and treated us more fairly. They should stop thinking they rule the pavements and the road. I am fed up of getting a mouthful of abuse of pedestrians who walk into the road in fron of me.",
