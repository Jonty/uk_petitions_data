            "background": "The Big White Taxi Service (BWTS) is an Internet community aimed at NHS Trust Ambulance Accident and Emergency IHCD staff in the UK.\n\nThe BWTS was founded 7 years ago by staff in London and has grown into what is the biggest and best Emergency Medical Service (EMS) web site on the Internet.\n\nSome years ago many NHS Trusts got to learn of the BWTS and the fact that it allowed EMS staff right across the UK to talk to each other, so the ambulance man in Glasgow could learn about the trials and tribulations of the ambulance man in London and visa versa.\n\nNHS trusts then started to \"ban\" or withdraw the BWTS web site from Service computers mainly because the managers did not like the fact they could not control the BWTS and the fact that if gave their staff a voice, a national voice.\n\nA&E Ambulance work is the same right across the UK, be it in London on 7/7, on a remote hillside in Wales, on a back street in Belfast or a tower block in Glasgow the ethos is the same.",
