            "background": "The govenment is under the impression that Agenda for change gave nurses a big pay increase - it did not in fact many nurses were undervalued by Agenda for change compared to other health care professionals. Agenda for Cahnge was the worst possible thing that could have happened to us.\n\n1.9% followed by another 1% does not match inflation. We are all suffering the high cost of Fuel, council tax, public transport costs, morgage increased. Being charged massive amounts to park our cars at work and remember most of us work shifts and need to frive to work to be safe on the way home. Also our regulatory body are giving us a massive hike in fees, where is all this money to come from certainly not our wages it does'nt cover the costs.\n\nPlease sign our petition to get a better deal for the ladies and gentlemen who put everything they have into providing 100% professional care to everyone who walks through the door of any hospital in the Country.",
