            "background": "At the last general election, the turn out was one of the lowest in history.  Australia has a compulsory voting system and they are a modern, forward looking country, so isn't it time the UK followed?  If this was introduced in conjunction with proportional representation (PR), the UK Government would be more reflective and more representative, so the public would be much more willing to partake in the process.  The current first past the post system is out of date and should be consigned to the history books. In addition the whole UK should have a more 'cross party' system such as the proposed power sharing assembly for Northern Ireland.",
