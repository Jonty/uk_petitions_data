        "background": "There were massive problems with access by telephone, software failures and inconsistences during the first year.  There were also\nvariations in wftc employees standards of training, this resulted in lost infomation e.g. declarations of change of income/circumstances putting the claimants at a disadvantage after the first year, creating overpayments and debt which caused claw-backs in future awards and payments resulting in less benefit and more hardship, increased poverty with anxiety and stress.  Especially during this first year some wftc staff were totally inconsistent in their information/guidance which contributed to in some cases thousands of pounds in overpayments to clients who had acted honestly in good faith & had given all information and changes in circumstances immediately to the agency.",
