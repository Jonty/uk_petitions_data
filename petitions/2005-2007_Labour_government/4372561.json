I approached the job centre, where I was informed that, as a self employed person, the only thing I could claim for was the cost of my insurance stamp. Even though I had a mortgage and children, and never ever drawn a day's benefit since leaving school at 15, I was not entitled to anything. I got over the bad period with great difficulty. Can anyone give me a good reason why this is so? Government is always suggesting starting your own business, but it is just too tough if you need help.",
