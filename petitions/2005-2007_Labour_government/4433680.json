We know they want us out of Iraq so they can invade themselves. We know our Navy personnel will face a brutal mickey mouse court and be executed for crimes that never even happened. Blair must stop pussyfooting around or their blood will be on his hands. We have the SAS for things like this. They must be sent in now to rescue our innocent sailors before it is too late. Everyone must sign this to send in the SAS to get our people home. To send in SAS to rescue the British hostages, sign this petition.",
