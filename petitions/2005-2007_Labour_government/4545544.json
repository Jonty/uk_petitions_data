            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In recent years it has become a common practice for commercial vehicles e.g. vans, pick ups, etc. to be parked in residential areas. This allows companies to avoid having to provide off road parking and private use of the vehicles for the employees.\nI believe that this practice should be stopped. Many of these vehicles are parked on pavements creating an obstruction. Also I doubt if the driver declares private use to the taxman.\nCompanies owe a moral duty to residents in these areas, which should be enforced. The self employed should not be unduly restricted however. If, for instance, a van is parked safely on the drive way of a house this should be considered acceptable.",
