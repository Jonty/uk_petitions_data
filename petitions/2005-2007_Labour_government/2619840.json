            "background": "To accompany the ID Card scheme, the government recieved the right in the Indentity Card Act 2006 to create a national identity database. This single database in Whitehall will hold the data of all peoples resident in this country, it will hold peoples addresses and every address at which someone has ever lived, their school records and their health records to name but a few. The Home Secretary holds the right to add any further categories to the system as he or she wishes. This will give the Government unprecedented power over its citizens and the only other country in the world which has such an extensive system is North Korea.\n\nTo protect the idea of liberalism and of liberty, the right to live free without government interference and intense knowledge of your personal life then sign this petition. Put simply this move represents the biggest single stepback in the history of our democracy, and is currently the biggest threat towards our way of life.",
