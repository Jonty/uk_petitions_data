            "background": "If the government had the courage to increase the fine for driving with one hand and a mobile phone in the other,the practise WILL stop.\nIt should be widely publicised that a \u00a3500 fine will be enforced and the drivers mobile phone confiscated for the first offence.\nA second conviction should result in confiscation of the phone and the vehicle.\nThe only reason people keep flouting the present law is because of the derisory fine at the present time.\nThe new proposal to increase the fine to \u00a360 WILL NOT stop the irresponsible\ndrivers.\nGive them something to really fear and the practise will soon stop.",
