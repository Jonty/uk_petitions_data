        "background": "The first part is aimed at people who drive down the middle lane of empty motorways, forcing other motorists to queue up to overtake in the third lane.\nThe overtaking definition is aimed at two types of motorway user: truck drivers who crawl past other trucks because both vehicles are running on limiters thus blocking lanes one and two for a number of miles, and lazy drivers who don't move back into lane one because they can see another car a mile or so in the distance and will only have to change lanes again.",
