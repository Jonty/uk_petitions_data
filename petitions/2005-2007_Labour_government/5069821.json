        "action": "Stop focusing on CO2 emissions and consider the embodied energy of products",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Whilst CO2 emissions have a significant impact on our planet, they are only part of the problem. By focusing on CO2 we are not considering other impacts our products and activities have on the planet. Embodied energy is the total energy consumed by a product from manufacture through use to disposal and is a much superior measure of the environmental impact of a product.  The prime example of how this works is the Hybrid Car. Whilst these produce less CO2 during use than most regular cars, they require considerably more energy and materials to manufacture and subsequently dispose. Thus in an attempt to reduce our impact on the environment we can actually do more damage to the environment, hence this petition.",
