            "background": "This is a petition to investigate the ruthless practice of insurance companies.  They are all too happy to take your premiums in full, on the designated date, every month.  For drivers, it is in fact compulsory.  However, in the event of a claim, they are evasive and Scrooge like.  They offer you a derisory sum as a first offer, then up it a few pounds a few months later.  If you want what you are entitled to, you are required to jump through hoops and wait an eternity.  When you have had your car, or even your back, smashed in, you do not want to wait as long as two years to be paid what you are legitimately owed.  It is unethical to deliberately withhold payment of due funds if your policy is paid up to date.  You are forced to endure the hardship of a lengthy 'bartering' procedure to get your money.  It's more like playing Deal or No Deal.  I ask that this legalised 'scam' be investigated further.",
