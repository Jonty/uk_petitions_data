        "action": "consider a tax at source on disposable (use once) items - such as packaging - even if it is recyclable.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "To discourage wasteful items such as supermarket wrapping and stupid plastic strirrers (where a washable spoon would do) they should be taxed at source - manufacture or import. The cost(say 1p per stirrer or plastic lid for paper cup, crisp packet wrapper, 2p for plastic bottles, m2 of cling film or shopping bag, 20p for throw away glass  etc) would be revenue for the government. Cost would inevitably be passed on to distributors and of course consumers. Consumers would be encouraged to purchase items without disposable content and distributors would be enouraged to reduce the cost / price of items and so make re-usable (deposit based packaging) \nScale the tax according to item mass and whether it is 1. dispose can't recycle, 2. can re-cycle (use once and melt down) or 3. no tax if can re-use / refil (wash and use many times) and deposit / return mechanism is in-place.",
