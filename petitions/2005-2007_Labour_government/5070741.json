            "background": "Although the majority of British secondary/high schools have anti bullying policies, this is not enough to protect homosexual students. there should be a seperate, direct anti-homophobic policy. i graduated from secondary school in 2006 after enduring seven years of non-stop homophobia. this gradually got worse as time passed and got soooo bad that i was terrified to attend school, knowing that i would have to endure another day of continuous homophobic bullying. i reported it on hunfreds of occasions, only to later realise that nothing was done to stop the situation. Isn't it time something was done about it?",
