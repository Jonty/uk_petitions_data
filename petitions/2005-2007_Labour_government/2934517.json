They need to wake up and realise they're there to represent us not to rule us, they work for us, they are not our rulers, and have no right to take away our civil liberties and freedoms. \n\nThere is a current petition with over 1.5mil signitures to scrap the road pricing and vehicle tracking policy. It's expected the PM will just sent an email saying basically \"this is what we're doing whether you like it or not\" and ignore the petition.\n\nMPs should represent their constituents and not do whatever the whips tell them to. ID cards and a database to monitor everyones entire life. The NHS dataspine showing thousands our confidential details. Major things happening and we the voters who they are meant to represent never get consulted.",
