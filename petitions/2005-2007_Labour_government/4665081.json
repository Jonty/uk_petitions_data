            "background": "Prime city centre locations do not need to be used for tax-payer-funded housing. City centre tower blocks should be demolished, and the land sold at significant premiums to developers. Inhabitants should be re-housed out of town where space is more abundant, therefore providing a superior quality of life (a purpose built 2 bedroom house rather than a 19th floor urine-scented tower block). With the surplus, infrastructure could be improved, and concessions given to displaced key workers who would need to commute.",
