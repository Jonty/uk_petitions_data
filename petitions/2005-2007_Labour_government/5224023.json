        "background": "The new logo for the London 2012 Olympics is absolutely rubbish. It is hard to believe that it could cost anywhere near \u00a3400,000 and take around a year to design. The old logo with the coloured ribbons in the shape of the Thames running through the words \"London 2012\" was far better, even if it was slightly boring. I suggest a new and much better logo is designed and until it is finished the old logo should be used.",
