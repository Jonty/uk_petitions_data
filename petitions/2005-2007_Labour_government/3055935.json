            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "To change Speed limits to the Road type. e.g near a school 20mph. Town centres keep 30mph and for other areas that are Very busy so it reduces the seriousness of a accident.\nHowever on country lanes and dual carriage ways have a 80mph limit. Motorways have different speeds in different lanes e.g slow lane 60mph middle 80mph and the fast upto 120Mph for those capable of doing so and you select you lane by what speed you are comfortable with so there's no Tailgaiting and anger caused by slow movers in front. Lastly penalty points should be scrapped for *speeding offences* and instead a Fine depending of the amount over the limit issued, but with the speed limit I suggested then people will not be on edge all the time looking at there speedometers when focus should be on the Road.\nHowever any other Road offences should carry Penalty Points e.g theft, driving without insurance etc.\nThanks for your support",
