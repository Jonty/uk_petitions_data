            "background": "All the money that the CSA has cost would have provided all the children with maintenance instead it has just been wasted. the pwc's don't get all their money and the nrp's family's suffer. The government needs to stop and think about all the money they have wasted and all the people who are affected. The CSA are a disaster that should and could be avoided. The CSA have never considered children just money this should be stopped now not in 2012 It will be to late in 2012 it will be five more years of suffering for nrp's and pwc's. The system should be able to look properly at everyones situation the formula the CSA use is not humane and has no consideration to any child. The system is failing to many people for it to be allowed to carry on. The CSA are being allowed to break rules and you can fight them but you can never win. Stop investing money into the csa and start investing money into the children instead.",
