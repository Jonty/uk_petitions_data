            "background": "Prevention is proven to be better (and cheaper) than cure. Addressing the causes of child poverty, social exclusion, crime and disorder and working with families from the start is the only way to effectively and compassionately tackle the alienation and misery of young people in this country. Don't stop community based outreach projects by starving them of funding. Prison as it is in this country at present is not effective, and is no place for a child. We need to think holistically and move away from knee-jerk, crowd pleasing reactions that are proven to have no effect on offending.",
