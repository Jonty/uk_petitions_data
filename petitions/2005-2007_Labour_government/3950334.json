My major source of spam is no longer African academics offering to share their fortune with me. No, it seems that every individual who has my e-mail address now wants me to e-sign some e-document about one petty selfishness or another in order that they can advance their own particular e-agenda. If you want to express an opinion, your MP can listen. That's what he's paid for. Stop wasting my time.",
