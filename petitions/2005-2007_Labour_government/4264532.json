All bans since 1997 will be banned. The British people want to retain their freedom. If someone wants to smoke in a pub, then why not? If someone wants to drink alcohol then there\u2019s nothing stopping you. Life\u2019s too short to worry about pathetic little things. Its time all banners were banned.",
