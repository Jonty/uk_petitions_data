        "background": "I served in the RAF for 14 years and during that time there was a retention of salary pending payment of a pension.  Despite the fact that I was put in for an award in conjunction with the Queen's Birthday Honours List I was told six months later I would not be allowed to sign on for a pensionable engagement as a quota system prevented this.  Basically I had received accelerated promotion, done a good job and there was no room  in MoD's plans for someone of my rank based on their projected requirement.  This is, to me, an iniquitous situation and goes against natural justice.",
