            "background": "Fossil fuel burning power stations are responsible for ~70% of bulk electriciy generation in the UK.  At best renewable sources might one day contribute ~15% of our power needs.  CCS technology could help us become self-reliant in terms of power generation by preventing the CO2 generated by burning coal from entering the atmosphere.  UK citizens have no direct control over how their electricity is generated, so it is up to Government to take the lead, both nationally and internationally to make a serious effort to reduce our carbon emmissions.  CCS technology is proven, and the CO2 can be used by oil companies in enhanced oil recovery programmes from depleted oil fields.  Our Government should offer special capital allowance status and at least some relief from the Climate Change Levy to encourage generators to adopt CCS: then we will seriously reduce CO2 emissions.",
