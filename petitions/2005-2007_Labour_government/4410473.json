        "background": "Hi,\n\nIm a 16 year old mature male who enjoys hanging around with mates. Now its not per pressure which has made me decide this as none of my mates have had a tatto neither anyone in their household. But i have now decided i would like to have a tatto on my body. I know the legal age is 18 but most 18 year olds get theirs done on their birthday whilst they are drunk. Ive put alot of thought and consideration into this tattoo and its no longer than a pencil. I have thought about the problems it can cause and once its there... its there. But ive come to the point where i think i am ready, but due to my age i can't. I think that the age should be brought down to 16. I know that this wil mean alot of other imature people will get alot of tattoo's done and will look stupid bt at the same time, why should the mature people of society suffer becuase of others.\n\nAnyway your votes would help drastically.",
