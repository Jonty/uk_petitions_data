            "background": "The notion of denying migrant entry to the UK on the grounds that a person is insufficiently proficient in the English language is being touted. This petition calls on our Prime Minister to denounce this idea before it has time to take root.  It is clearly not going to be possible to apply such a test to EU citizens without fundamentally undermining the foundations of the European ideal. So, the real impact of such a proposal will fall almost entirely on people from the Commonwealth and other areas of the developing world. This is overt racial discrimination and we ought to object on these grounds alone. In addition, the measure is potentially targeted not only at so-called \u2018economic migrants\u2019 but also at spouses. This means that families will be coercively separated by legislation. Surely this is an unacceptable moral position for our country to adopt.",
