        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In this day and age, with developing countries rapidly closing the gap in production and education, it is bordering on incompetence that no more has been done to further this issue.\n\nScience degrees (and some arts as well) have lasting benefit to the economy. We need lawyers, doctors, engineers, scientists - even economists to not only function as a society, but to add value to our expensive products.\n\nInstead, we encourage arts subjects (both by making them easier to learn, with reduced prices for foreign students, and by making them more prevalent, due to recent science college closures), at the expense of subjects that will help further Britain's greatness in the future.\n\nThis petition calls on the government to combat this threat, by subsidising those on science degrees, increasing funding at lower educational levels (from high school onwards), and by increasing links with businesses, to provide better paid jobs for graduates, or more apprenticeship schemes.\n\nOnly the government can stop our scientific decline, and end a reliance on foreign workers to supply our key services. Don't save pence today to lose pounds tomorrow!",
