Death rates on the road are well above the national average but would be cut by providing safer junctions and longer, more frequent sections of dual carraige to allow safer overtaking.  Local councils dismiss the option of fully dual-carraiged road as costly and time-sapping, but how is human life weighed against money/time?",
