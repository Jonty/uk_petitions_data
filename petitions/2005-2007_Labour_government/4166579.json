This is a major cause for concern for many residents in London. \n\nIt is clear that for any individual to fail to land a punch on a target of Mr Lampards magnitude, this individual is very likely to be suffering from some form of vision impediment. Therefore for the safety of all residents in London and the fan himself, I ask Mr Prime Minister to grand this Tottenham fan a free eye check-up at the local options.\n\nKind regards,\n\nA very concerned London resident.",
