They put up unclear signs, and encourage mixed messages in order to trap motorists into paying fines, to swell there coffers. One example is on the border of Westminster and Kensington and Chelsea where it is not clear which pay and display machine does which borough and people get clamped by both councils for using the wrong machines. We must stop this. Powers must be returned to the police and revenue to the treasury. Stop this daylight robbery.",
