            "background": "This man since being Torquay United chairman has made a once friendly little club into the laughing stock of the whole Football League. He is systematically tearing apart the very fabric of a club in order to persue his business ambitions, namely a new stadium complex including a new Hotel and retail facilities. He stands to make a lot of money while my beloved club is sinking faster than a rammed U-Boat. He must be stopped. Please help us Mr Blair. It will be your finest legacy.",
