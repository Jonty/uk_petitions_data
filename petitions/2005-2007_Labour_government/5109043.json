            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently it is an offence to move your vehicle to allow an emergency vehicle pass at a junction where there is a red light. Rule 213 of the Highway Code stipulates that you must not move your vehicle forward over or past the white line even if there\u2019s an emergency vehicle trying to break through UNLESS instructed to do so by a uniformed police officer. In 2006, the rule was amended to include: \u201c\u2026or break traffic laws by, for example, pulling forward across a stop line at a red traffic light.\"\n\nIt is with great sadness that common sense does not prevail here. Recent court cases show that facilitating the passage of an emergency vehicle is not regarded as a valid defence to a prosecution brought with evidence obtained by a red-light camera. Surely it borders on the criminal if you don't move even when to do so is perfectly safe? Obstructing the emergency services could cost someone's life.\n\nI plead with the Government to implement a change on rule 213.",
