        "background": "Modify the current method of collecting council tax so as to take into account the ability of householders to pay. The  current method of setting council tax on the value of properties is unfair. It should  be set on the householders income and ability to pay. The current system is unfair to those on limited or fixed incomes. It should also not exceed the current inflation figures. Especially as it is currently not included in the  Retail Price index for setting inflation figures.",
