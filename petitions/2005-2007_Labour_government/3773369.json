        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Our grounds for opposing the trials are:\n\n1. The possible safety impacts of Genetically Modified crops.\n\n2. Contamination of non-GM crops by cross fertilisation with GM crops and the possible impact on organic farming.\n\n3. The lack of demand for GM products, giving further impetus to adopting the Precautionary Principle.\n\n4. The lack of need to genetically modify potatoes for Blight resistance, conventional plant breeding techniques having already developed Blight resistance in 20% of potato varieties.\n\n5. The lack of care shown by DEFRA who defined much weaker conditions for the trials compared to the Irish government who rejected such trials.",
