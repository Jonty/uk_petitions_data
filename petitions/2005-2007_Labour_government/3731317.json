        "background": "As our climate changes and gets warmer, waste left uncollected for two weeks at a time is a health hazard. It becomes a magnet for vermin, and a breading ground for maggots/flies plus the horrendous smells that go with uncollected waste. Councils use the fortnightly collection as a cost cutting exercise without regard to the health of the public that elected them.",
