            "background": "All pupils in years 10 and 11 in schools are forced to take part in PE for one hour per week. Scrap this because:\n\n- It is done to help keep children fit. By the time you have got changed, and began the game, you only get around 40 minutes per week doing it. This is not going to go anywhere towards keeping children fit - it's just not enough\n\n- Pupils who are of lower sporting ability do not benefit from it in any other way either, as they will not ever need to play the games played in later life fore any reason. People who are of sporting ability can take GCSE PE as an elective subject if they choose\n\n- Due to these two reasons, core PE is not a valuable subject and the time would be much more useful to children if they were doing subjects in which they actually get a qualification in, for example maths or science. It's a waste of time to the less able, and hinders the learning of other subjects due to lack of time in completing courses such as the two English GCSE's",
