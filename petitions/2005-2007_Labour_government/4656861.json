They are creating a noise nuisance for the people that have to live next to them.\n\nI wouldn't go as far to say they should be banned completely, but there should be a minimum requirement in relation to size of trampoline/size of garden and for them to be placed a certain distance from any boundary.  If your outdoor space doesn't meet the grade, then you can't have one.\n\nCouncils are receiving record numbers of complaints regarding the disturbances being caused by their intrusive manner.",
