            "background": "Neckties are a major source of infection in our hospitals. Whilst examining patients doctors often have their ties dragged across the patient's body and bedclothes. Doctors then go from patient to patient taking germs with them. Neckties are almost never cleaned by men and this is a clear public health issue of the utmost importance!\n\nTheir are more people who die needlessly in hospital from infections that they caught INSIDE the hospital than die in road traffic accidents each year for the whole country. This is tragic and it's time to do something about it.",
