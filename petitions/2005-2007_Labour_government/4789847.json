We have interests north of the border but have no means by which to influence its outcome. UK residents abroad have the right to vote in UK elections by post and under the new constitutional arrangements this right should be extended. I would expect that the vast majority of Scots living in England or elesewhere would not support Scottish Independence and believe that prosperity and peace on our island is best served by the strengthening of the United Kingdom.",
