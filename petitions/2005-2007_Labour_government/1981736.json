            "background": "during my younger years, persistant young offenders were punished for their crimes or misdameaners, and the PC brigade have ruined this with their lets try to understand rather than punish. Is obvouis to the law abiding UK citizens that trying to understand these young criminals hasn't worked. Using the old and outdated theory that a bad up bringing breeds badly behaved younsters is wrong, bad parenting breeds young criminals and todays parents seem to take a lenient view of their younsters bad behaviour.\nA short sharp shock like the pilot schemes currently working in the USA word in my opinion have a positve effect on badly behaved and criminally intent on todays youngster in the UK",
