            "background": "The proposal of the government to extend police powers to include the ability to stop and question citizens without the need for suspicion of a crime having being committed is a threat to the democratic way of life.\n\nWe, the undersigned, believe that the argument made of security coming before civil liberties in priority is incorrect, this proposed legislation will create hours more paperwork for police who already acknowledge that they have sufficient powers in dealing with terrorism and crime.\n\nWe, the undersigned, ask the government  to strongly reconsider these measures as they are an invasion of privacy, an erosion of civil liberties and added \"red tape\" for our police forces.",
