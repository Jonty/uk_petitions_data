            "background": "Mike Oldfield changed the world of music when in 1973 at just 20 years of age he created the multi million selling album \"Tubular Bells\" (which also launched Sir Richard Branson's Virgin label). It stayed at no.1 in the UK charts for a whole year and was only toppled by its successor \"Hergest Ridge\". Now, over 23 albums and 30 years later Mike is still at the forefront of modern music technology and creativity.\nAlso a contributor to charity work he was made a freeman of London in 1981.\nIf anyone deserves an honour in recognition of his work it is Mike Oldfield.",
