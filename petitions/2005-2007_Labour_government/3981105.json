            "background": "Mobile phones with cameras and internet access should be banned for children at school.  I feel that if this went ahead that 'happy slapping' would less likely, children would not be able to download or have access to inappropriate material/pictures.  My daughter has been 'happy slapped' twice. The police/school did nothing because there were no witnesses.  There is no censoring what sites children can go on via their mobile phones.  I feel that banning these sorts of mobiles can only benefit society in the long run. Schools go to great lengths to censor they're internet access etc. but these mobiles make a mockery of this.",
