            "background": "Government policy cut rail services in rural areas to save money. Bus services were liberalised so that companies cherry-picked the best routes and dropped the poor payers. Rural dwellers should be compensated by discounting road fuel as cars are the only transport many of us have. A smart card used to pay at the pumps would ensure that only those who qualified got the discount. This system is used in N. Italy based on post code.",
