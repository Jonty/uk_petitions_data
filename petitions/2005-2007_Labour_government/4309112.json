        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "While the use of so called 4 x 4 vehicles in urban areas is unnecessary and in many cases a bad thing, some people living in rural communities are reliant on such vehicles due to the poor standard of the transport infrastructure in the area. If people such as farmers and rural workers are forced to pay this punative tax then it will simply lead to an increase in prices for all. A system of relief for those LIVING in these communities should be introduced",
