It appears to be that you have to justify absolutely everything you do to this Government to the n-th degree, which results in staff spending more time notating what you are meant to do than actually delivering a service.  The only people that win from this over analysis of public services are the many, many consultants that they appear to have to draft in, increased tiers of middle management and the statisticians.",
