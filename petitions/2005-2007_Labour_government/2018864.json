            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This Government say that road charging is the way to stop the increase of traffic, if we believed that we would have believed 'broad-band' would not become popular! A charge would be an insult to the disabled, the elderly to name a few. Disabled have a right to access the same as able bodied, so we are told!  Saying we must pay to have the right of freedom! The government are trying to take away those rights. Benefits paid for those who are disabled and those over the retirement age are pathetic, to say the least - So how can any sane person ask them to pay what they do not have in the first place; extra money to pay for road charging. How about charging extra car tax for all those who can afford to pay, like those who use 4x4s and cars over a certain cc in engine size, and of course those with more than one car per person. The problem is not the fact we have more cars, but the dismal failure over many years by government to accept roads are out-dated, and have been since the 60s.",
