        "background": "These are London's Olympics, with the legacy such as affordable housing, venues and infrastructure being available to Londoners. No other area of the UK will have any discernible benefit either before, during or after. Indeed, the cost of travel, London accomodation and tickets to events will be unaffordable to most outside the Capital. Thus, ALL costs must be met by Londoners and not Treasury funds which are for the benefit of the whole of the UK.",
