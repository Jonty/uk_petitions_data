            "background": "Visitors to Canadian WW1 war memorials at Vimy Ridge and Beaumont Hamel in France are guided by young Canadians who apply for scholarships to undertake this role.  A similar scheme for young people who are normally resident in the UK  should be initiated by the United Kingdom government.  Such a scheme would be a fitting commemoration as we approach the centenary of the outbreak of hostilities  in 1914.  \n\nAfter public consultation to determine suitable sites and negotiations with interested parties currently responsible for their supervision, successful applicants should be used as guides at sites such as (for example)Tyne Cot near Ypres, Thiepval, Beaumont Hamel and Schwaben Redoubt on the Somme.\n\nThe presence of British young people acting as guides at these sites or others yet to be determined would also be a constant reminder of the sacrifices made by the constituent nations, provinces and principalities of the United Kingdom during World War One.",
