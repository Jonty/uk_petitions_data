            "background": "One of the easiest ways to reduce our impact on the environment would be to introduce a tax on aviation or jet fuel. If this fuel had the same taxes as petrol or diesel, then there would be a significant drop in carbon emissions throughout the world. Our government needs to be brave and have the courage to introduce it. Other governments would then follow and we would be a step closer to reducing our impact on climate change.",
