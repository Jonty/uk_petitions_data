            "background": "As a 31 year old I hold 3 separate pension plans. By the time I retire I will probably have several more. Why? Because each time I move from one employer to another they only contribute to a single, approved company scheme. I cannot close my old schemes without paying a hefty penalty.\nThe job market has changed. People move company far more frequently and millions will be in my position. This petition requests that the government review pension law to make this situation better. Compel employers to put their contribution into the scheme of the employee's choice.",
