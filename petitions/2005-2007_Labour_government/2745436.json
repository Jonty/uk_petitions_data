            "background": "Limiting the number of UK Driving Licences available would be a way to put a halt to growing traffic congestion. New Licences would only become available when someone surrenders their licence, dies or has their licence revoked. These licences would be given out to a waiting list on a first come first served basis. New 'young' drivers could apply early to the DVLA at 16.\nNone British residents living in the UK could apply for a UK Driving Licence on entry to the country. They then could be given a limited time (say 12 - 24 Months) to obtain one through the waiting list.\n\nI Urge the Great British public to sign this petition.",
