            "background": "Alcohol-free or low-alcohol beers in pubs and clubs are the same price or in some cases more expencive then the full strength rivals.  Not the best way to decrease binge drinking.  In some pubs, the cost of a pint can be \u00a32, while a low or non-alcoholic alternative is the equivant of \u00a33.  Could the government not subsidize the cost to lower it to eg. \u00a31.50 for the equivalant of a pint to try and attract more customers to drink it.  How can people be expected to cut down their alcohol intake when it is cheaper to consume  full-strength alcohol compared to non and low-alcolic drinks.  I think the government should really look into this to provide an affordable alternative for those of us who enjoy our social lives but would like to make a positive move towards a healthier lifestyle.",
