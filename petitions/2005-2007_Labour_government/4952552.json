            "background": "I would like to put forward that all paedophiles be given the death penalty via lethal injection when found guilty. They admit themselves that the condition cannot be cured, and will when given chance, re-offend. Our childrens right to live a life free from these predatory monsters MUST come before any so called human rights for these creatures. I feel that it's about time the government changed the laws of the land to protect the innocent, and not protect the guilty as it currently does. How many more children must be attacked/murdered/abducted before we as citizens of this country get justice.",
