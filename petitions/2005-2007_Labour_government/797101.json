            "background": "I think it unfair that those with a higher income pay proportionately more tax, once their earnings are above a certain level. There is no incentive to work harder and pay even more tax unless one's income is astronomical. These people often choose private education and health-care, thus saving public expenditure (to which they are still contributing through taxes). A flat rate of income tax would be fairer and also much simpler to calculate: Those with a low income will continue to pay a small amount; those in the middle income bracket will be largely unaffected; those with a high income will pay less tax than currently but will continue to pay large sums by virtue of the fact that they earn a lot of money.",
