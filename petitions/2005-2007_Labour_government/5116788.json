            "background": "On-street parking nearby a disabled driver\u2019s residence may be rendered inaccessible because of demand by other drivers and/or new developments. Lack of access to parking could render the home quite unsuitable for use by the disabled resident. Where there is pressure on parking spaces, local authorities should be required to designate on-street parking spaces for disabled drivers as near their homes as possible and to refuse permission for projects (public or private) that would deprive disabled drivers of access to parking nearby their homes. This duty should be exercised on a case by case basis. In order to claim access to a reserved parking space, the claimant should have to (1) be a permanent resident, (2) hold a valid driving licence, (3) have a Blue Card, (4) have difficulty in walking further than to the nearest on-street parking space and (5) have no alternative means of parking other than on-street.",
