            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Statutory Maternity Pay should be increased.  This cannot be done unless we receive the support of other young mothers (to be).  After all, we are bringing the future generations into this world, without us doing this, the world will all be cease and life will end as we know it.  I see it as the future generations are the future Tax and National Insurance payers therefore we deserve more support and pay to have children.  We have paid Tax and National Insurance for years, yet the more we earn and pay out on Tax and Insurance, the less we get in benefits when we need them the most.  Yet the unemployed are eligible for more benefits we need more money to help us with this.  We have to pay the for a roof over the family's heads, food on the table and electricity for warmth, and to prevent illness.  Our bodies hold the future generations your help is needed. Don't let this carry on the way it is.",
