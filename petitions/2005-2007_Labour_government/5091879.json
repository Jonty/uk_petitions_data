        "background": "Why is it our society is made to pay charges, when it is in fact the price of our enviromental problems.  We joe public seem to carry the can for everything, whilst the billionare club make profits,  Why are we buying goods cheap from poor nations, and paying next to nothing, then bringing the product here to sell for maximum prices, im sure it uses alot of fuel to bring them here, and im quite positive that they dont use degreadable packaging either.  They argue that they try to drop prices and things get cheaper, but the quality of our purchase is not for ourselves its done for profit and corporate greed.  You politicians MUST be very arrogant and very iggnorant, We dont ask much, a fair living inside our nation, fair taxes, and most of all, honest representatives that belong to us.  I urge our people to BAN all corporations paying into the funds of any party, all donations CANNOT be anonymous.  Any interferance by ANY corporations or international bankers must be brought to the attention of joe public and that party must be finded and removed from office.",
