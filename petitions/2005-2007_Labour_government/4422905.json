PLease verify at http://www.sydneyobservatory.com.au/blog/?m=20070323\n\nPerhaps a simple natural event could be the final cause of this unfortunate stand off. The UK government should verify the same and present this data to  Iran and the UN. All sides should forget and forgive each other for the consequences of this natural event.\n\nOnly Tony can do this? Petition for peace becuase this situation can get very bad for the whole world.",
