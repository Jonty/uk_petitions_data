            "background": "Pensions have been saved up over the years with income that has been taxed already. Why the government can get away with taxing it again is beyond me. millions of people have been dedicated in saving for their future and the government take more from these honest and decent citizens. Then they wonder how they can't help the retired generation, when you can bet that the money taxed on the pensions doesn't go to any pension scheme to help induviduals in need.",
