            "background": "The Act of Settlement 1701 specifically discriminates against Catholics or persons married to Catholics from succeeding to the Throne. In fact, it also prevents people of Jewish or Muslim faiths - and others - from standing in the line of succession. This is clearly discriminatory, bigoted and an anachronism in the 21st Century and we call for its Repeal.",
