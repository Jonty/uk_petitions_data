        "background": "We, supporters of the Campaign to Save the Ashford & St Peter\u2019s NHS Hospitals, call on the Prime Minister to halt the possible closure of & cuts to services at the Ashford and St Peter\u2019s NHS Hospitals. The hospitals provide high quality healthcare to generations of residents from Surrey & Middlesex & the surrounding area, & we believe that the hospital should have an integral role to play in providing excellent treatment for local residents of all ages for years to come. NHS care in our community would be severely damaged by any decision to close or substantially reduce the services available at the hospital. We urge the Government & the PM not to take this retrograde step and to safeguard the future of Ashford & St Peter\u2019s NHS Hospitals. Ashford is situated on the A30 west of London, close to junction 13 of the M25 and Heathrow Airport. St. Peter\u2019s is situated between Woking and Chertsey near jct. 11 off the M25, 30 miles SW of central London & 10miles from Heathrow Airport.",
