            "background": "The North Circular Road is one of the bussiest in the country serving as an orbital road for the suburbs of North London. This includes junctions with the M11, A10, A1, M1, M4 and others. At present due to a historical lack of investment in the infrastructure these junctions and other sections of the North Circular are heavily congested, causing major economic, social and environmental harm. The A406 must be given the necessary investment to improve the flow of traffic throughout as well as a direct public transport alternative provided. At present no public transport alternative exists and so many commuters are left with no alternative but to use this road. A train, tram or bus lane should be implemented.",
