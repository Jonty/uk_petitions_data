            "background": "Clubscan seems to have crept into use across the UK at pubs and clubs, to build up a database of UK citizen IDs by scanning driving licenses and passports. These records are associated with unknown details with potential for marketing. More worrying is that this scheme does not seem to have been launched with any proper thought to data security. IDs are being scanned without owners being given a choice about having their personal information stored. A laptop outside a Pub on a Saturday night doesn't seem too secure, how many staff can access this data - and who checks on them? At a time when identity theft is on the increase who's to say the data won't be sent to scammers in Nigeria? What stops a doorman from passing on details for use in crime?\n\nSupport this petition to ban Clubscan until it can be reviewed by government and centrally managed. Until that time our personal information will not be safe in the hands of bar staff alone.",
