            "background": "I am a European lorry driver who has to encounter Calais alot. This town is unsafe for us UK drivers as we are getting mugged, when we park up to sleep immigrants get into our trailers even when sealed, padlocked and have a cord. When us UK drivers get beaten the French do not want to know and we just get told this is a problem for the British Authorities. Will it take a UK driver to get killed just doing his job or trying to get some sleep and he gets gassed and killed before our Goverment will finally do something about this problem which is making UK lorry drivers lives a hell. You keep saying drivers need to rest more, but they cannot even sleep safe in their cabs and our so called Goverment are doing nothing as always as they cannot tax this problem.",
