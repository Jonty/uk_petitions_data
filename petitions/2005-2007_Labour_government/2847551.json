            "background": "Over the past year, many users of public transport, buses and trains in particular, have noticed and become annoyed that an increasing number of people are playing music from poor-quality \"tinny\" speakers on mp3 players and mobile telephones. Not only is such music playing annoying for the other passengers - on buses, it can compromise the safety of all the passengers if the driver becomes distracted. Surely the users of public transport and bus drivers deserve the right to go about their daily routine without being forced to listen to music throughout their journey?",
