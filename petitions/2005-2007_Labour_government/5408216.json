        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Everybody knows that the price of housing has risen way above inflation over the past ten years. \n\nHowever the maximum discount applied to council homes has not risen in proportion. In my area its currently capped at \u00a338,000, instead of the 50% I wouldve earned under the old rules, therefore making it impossible for me to be able to afford to buy my house.\n\nA discount which was once a large portion of the house value under conservative government is now reduced to a pittance.\n\nThe cap on the discount needs raising so that the discount will once again make the right to buy an affordable way to get onto the property ladder.  I know people did abuse the right to buy in the past, but the councils could introduce new tougher laws to prevent this.",
