In this petition we ask the Prime Minister to create a system which acknowledges people's health problems and will allow them to automatically go back onto benefits at any time in the future, once having left benefits and gone to work, at the same rate as previously if their illness, disability or medical condition proves to be something which prevents them from working. In so doing we ask that sick and disabled people in the UK are no longer considered to be unwilling to work, and that they are given the basic courtesy of having their testimony as to their illness considered true rather than being considered an excuse not to work.",
