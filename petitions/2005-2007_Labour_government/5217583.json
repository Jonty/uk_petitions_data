            "background": "Around 3 million people use the London underground each day, for those of us who are in good health and without any disabilities, its really not a problem... but what about the other people who limit themselves to travelling because there is no support for them at the point of their destination?? It doesnt seem fair. Parents with buggies, foriegners with luggage etc We need lifts and ramps built.\n\nI know the set time for all this to be done is 2012, but Londoners need it much sooner then that not just for when the Olympics start. The plans were set in 2002 if I am correct, then why is it taking so long??\n\nI understand their are changes and improvements being made, but we need to speed up the process, employ more professionals.\n\nMake London an enjoyable and safer place for everyone!",
