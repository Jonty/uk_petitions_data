        "action": "Remove the Power of Local Authorities to Place Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) on Private Gardens",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 Town and Country Planning (Trees) Regulations 1999 powers are granted for more general protection of trees on private land than the specimen trees formerly protected.\n\nTrees as are present because of the activities of, and at the cost to, gardeners. \n\nIt is outrageous that trees planted under such circumstances shall be commandeered by the local authority who have made no investment in the trees anyway. This is a gross infringement of the rights of (usually) freeholders to enjoy their gardens and to invest in them to make improvement. Such TPOs remove the right of a garden owner to change their mind at will as to which trees (other than special specimen trees, as above) should remain on their land. Those rights must be restored.\n\nThere is a further issue, in that the inability to remove such trees is severely limiting the attempts of developers to build the housing stock required by government policy, social housing in particular.",
