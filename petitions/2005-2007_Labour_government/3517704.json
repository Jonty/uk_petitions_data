            "background": "there are many accidents, mostly serious, caused by people who buy pleasure boats of one kind or another, new or second hand, who do not know water safety whether it means \"rules of the road\" or the carrying and using of safety equipment such as life jackets,flares and radios. These people cause accidents by reckless driving and are a danger to themselves as well as other water users especially in the coastal waters. They also cost the RNLI many thousands of pounds every year to rescue all involved. Make people take courses, have certificates or licences as well as insurance and carry them at all times as if they were on a road in a car. It is often more dangerous to have an accident in the sea than on a road as not only can they have serious injuries or drown but they can suffer from hypothermia if in the water for as little as 30mins, more often a combination of 2 or more noted.",
