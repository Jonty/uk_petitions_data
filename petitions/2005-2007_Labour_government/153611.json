        "background": "Basically the idea is that the money raised should be ringed fenced for a specific objective rather than just go into general treasury funds. \n\nBy ring fencing it for this purpose the tax will be 'green' not just in the sense that it is punative tax on a polluting means of travel but that the money will be used to fund 'greener' fuels in the future.\n\nThis will should aid British science/industry.\n\nJust a point to note, I don't consider myself particularily 'green' but I would like the money used for research into alternative sources of energy. I'm not pushing any particular source of energy. I don't claim to be an expert on the subject.",
