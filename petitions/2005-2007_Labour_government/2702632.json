            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The urgency of the need to reduce world fuel consumption is well established. Current transport aircraft need to burn huge volumes of fuel to generate lift, as well as for forward propulsion. In the 1930s, huge capacity airships proved the great potential for lighter than air aircraft, for which lift was provided free of change by an envelope of hydrogen. However, confidence in airships was shattered after the devastating Hindenburg explosion (actually caused by the ship's flammable reflective paint). Technologies now exist for a new generation of hybrid airships, which use the inert helium gas for lift instead of the potentially explosive hydrogen. These craft would be able to operate with greatly improved fuel economy compared to conventional aeroplanes, as well as being much quieter, and able to lift much heavier payloads. A major switch in aviation policy towards airships would pay huge future dividends in energy conservation and climate - change reduction.",
