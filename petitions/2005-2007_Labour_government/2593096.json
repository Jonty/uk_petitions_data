            "background": "The condition of the nation\u2019s roads must be the worst in Western Europe. Our roads are riddled with pot holes and a road surface that is crumbling. Tax payer\u2019s money seems to be wasted on cosmetic white lines, red lines or excessive amounts of speed bumps rather than dealing with the fundamental condition of the road surface. The state of our roads is not only damaging to car suspension, wheels, steering, but can also be the cause of accidents. Why does the government allow traffic congestion through our towns and villages, when some of the worst black spots could be bypassed? I have to drive through a village every day that has a single carriageway bridge which is controlled by traffic lights - the congestion is terrible, not to mention the pollution suffered by the villagers. It is about time that the British people started to demand the kind of infrastructure enjoyed by other wealthy nations, instead of a network that seems more at home in a 2nd or 3rd rate economy!",
