            "background": "I think it is a disgrace how over the past however many number of years the press have been able to get away with making peoples lives a misery by following every detail of their life from the moment they wake up to the end of the day. A prime example is the treatement of Kate Middleton, is she going to be another Princess Diana where the press hound her to death? Do they not want her and William to be happy? The treatment of Steve Mclaren is another great example and football managers past and present. I strongly believe the press should have so much less powers and many more restrictions and \"celebrities\" should be able to get restraining orders on papers. The press are a nuisance and the things they get up to and away with are a disgrace it amounts to stalking.",
