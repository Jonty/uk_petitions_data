        "background": "The Torbay area suffers from some deprivation in many ways economically; the unemployment rate is exceptionally low - at that those who are employed find it hard to find work as the average wage is disproportionate to the mounting house prices in this area.\nIt is likely that the council may give the go ahead for the building of housing on vacant natural space, encroaching upon the natural habitats to the rural limits of Torbay and what are seen to be areas of outstanding beauty. I urge the council to reconsider the building of houses on existing land primed for development or to limit the building of housing in the area that is not affordable to the majority and the deprived.",
