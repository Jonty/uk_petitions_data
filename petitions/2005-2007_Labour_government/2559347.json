J Anderson apparently travelled 60,448 miles by car last year which, assuming an overall average of 40 mph including breaks, would have consumed over 1500 hours of her time.\nThe average working year is around 1800 hours - some claim to work more, but how effectively? so this MP was left with around 300 hours for Parliamentary and Constituency business.\nThis is NOT what hard working and hard pressed taxpayers expect from their elected representatives!",
