            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Train tickets are too complicated and should be charged on a per mile basis only for all tickets at all times.  \n\nOperators should be restricted to charging users a maximum of 4 pence a mile each way with no minimum.  A London to Edinburgh ticket would therefore be \u00a341.84 return maximum, Leeds to Bristol \u00a316.48 return maximum etc.  \n\nAirlines should be allowed to subsidise airport bound passengers.  It will reduce car pollution.  \n\nOperators should be granted national franchises.  They could then compete directly against one another on the same routes to encourage cleanliness and punctuality.\n\nRail operators should be allowed 1 price rise a year, controlled by the government.",
