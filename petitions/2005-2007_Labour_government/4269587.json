            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Simple really. I believe it is unfair for travel companies to charge higher prices during school holidays, it is unfair on parents who have no choice but to take their children on holiday during this season. In some cases it can cost upwards of \u00a3300 per person to go on the SAME holiday in the week previous. Not only is it unfair on families but on everyone who books holidays during this time.\n\nI want to have this petition signed by as many people as possible, please forward to the to family, friends and collegues. I am aiming for at least one million signitures or more during a 3 month period.",
