            "background": "To become a qualified Architect one must study for a minimum of 7 years yet normally this is 8-10. 5 years at University and a minimum 2years  (usually 4) in Practice before final Part 3 exams.\nThe Profession is not highly paid and is certainly not on a par with a Solicitor or Doctor's salaries. \nStudent debts currently reach \u00a320,000+ and these are the students whom started paying tutition fees of \u00a31000 per year.  \u00a33,000+ per anum fees will only raise the debt level to \u00a335- \u00a340,000!  Architect's are very necessary and valuable knowledge assests in today's society whom rarely get their required acknowledgement. Support government grants to encourage new graduates pay for their intended professional qualification and bridge the gap to avoid a potentially huge skills shortage.",
