        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The creation of a sub class of HGV vehicle license would allow road hauliers to reduce their vehicle operating costs in return for using the roads during a restricted time period, generally when the roads are quieter.\n\nThis new policy would have the effect of directly reducing operating costs to hauliers as well as reducing the overall volume of heavy goods vehicles on the road, reducing congestion and peak time pollution. \n\nThe policy can be enforced using the existing DVLA licence registration database which is accessible to most, if not all police authorities.",
