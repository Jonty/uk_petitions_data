We propose that such employers should be heavily fined as they add to heavily congested roads and are guilty of polluting the atmosphere.\n\n2. Are you sick to the back teeth of having to recycle the endless stream of circular letters from Credit Card companies who are trying to entice you to get in debt? Companies who are responsible for wasting millions of tonnes of paper per year should be heavily fined. We propose that these people be held accountable for the damage they are doing to our planet.",
