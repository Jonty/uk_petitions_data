I believe that Andy Mcnab is someone who trully deserves recognition for his work, and for his brilliant accounts of his life in his 'Immedate Action' and 'Bravo Two Zero' books, and also his very gripping fictitious novels.\n   Thankyou for taking the time to hear my views and I hope they are taken seriously.",
