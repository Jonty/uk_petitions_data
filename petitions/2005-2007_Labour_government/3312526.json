            "background": "The idea of tracking every vehicle at all times is sinister and wrong. Road pricing is already here with the high level of taxation on fuel. The more you travel - the more tax you pay.\n\nIt will be an unfair tax on those who live apart from families and poorer people who will not be able to afford the high monthly costs.\n\nPlease Mr Blair - forget about road pricing and concentrate on improving our roads to reduce congestion",
