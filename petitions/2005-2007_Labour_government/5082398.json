        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With Britain having the highest teenage pregnancy rate in the EU, does it not make sense to cut the VAT charge, Thus making condoms more affrodable? This would also encourage safer sex practices in general. Whilst Family Planning clinics offer free contraception these are often poorly planned with short operating hours and unapproachable staff. This needs to be addressed.",
