            "background": "It is currently not possible to backdate claims more than 3 months. In my case this has meant that because I was honest and waited until the end of the tax year in order to confirm my salary I have lost out on a considerable amount of money. Had I lied about my salary or guessed the income then I would have been paid an incorrect amount and would now most likely owe the government. How is this fair that I would owe the money back and yet I cannot claim back further than 3 months.",
