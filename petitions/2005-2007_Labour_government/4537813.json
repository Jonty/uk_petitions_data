            "background": "Many false allegations of abuse are fuelled by the prospect of financial reward running into many thousands of pounds.  The more serious the allegation, the more money is paid.  The Government\u2019s CICA (Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority) even has a \u2018price list\u2019 showing which allegations attract how much money. The latest version of this price list is available on-line at the CICA website (from the website, click 'the scheme' then '2001 scheme'), so it is clearly readily accessible to those wishing to make fraudulent claims against innocent people.  Replacing financial compensation (other than for actual material loss) where there is absolutely no proof of abuse other than the allegation, would dramatically reduce false allegations, fraudulent claims, and wrongful convictions.",
