With only 6 months to go, the campaign to \"Free The Rathmines One\" needs your urgent help!\n\nPutting the \"Doc\" back into 'toberfest!' This campaign for justice is in reaction to the struggle of one man and his continuing battle to enjoy a good time at Das Oktoberfest 2007. Although not an easy conquest we, the administrators of \"Docspace\", have taken a pledge of allegiance to stand 'shoulder to shoulder' with Paul (aka P.Doccles) in a bid to salvage his Oktoberfest 2007 aspirations. We do this not only for Paul Doherty, but also for what he has now come to represent, we do this for all the other P. Doccles out there, each fighting to have their own fun at their own \"beer festival.\" This is because within each and everyone of us is a little P. Doccles who is trying desperately to get out, but has been told he is \"not allowed to.\"\n\nwww.myspace.com/doctoberfest",
