            "background": "He called for a zero-tolerance policy on 'petty' crimes (as far as littering and fare-dodging on public transport) to clean up the city. He encouraged the NYPD to pursue goals aggressively, as well as charting officer performance by quantifying criminal apprehensions using \"CompStat\".  The crime index per 100,000 citizens of New York was double the national average in 1990 (Newark was treble). By the time he left his position in 2001, it had in fact decreased BELOW the national average. This was achieved even with America's gun laws, and more prominant gang culture. I believe petty/street crime is becoming too big an issue to mishandle with ASBO's etc. I think deterence should be used to halt this trend in the near future, with an understanding of behaviour being a secondary measure once the trend significantly reverses.",
