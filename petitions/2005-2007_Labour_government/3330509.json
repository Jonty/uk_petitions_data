        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It would make sense to keep long term prisoners in countries where costs are low, as banks have done with call centres. It would be a simple formula to decide at which length of sentence this would become financially worth while. E.g.: For a 2 month sentence - 2 x flights @200 + 8 * 200pw = \u00a32000 versus uk400pw x 8 weeks =\u00a33200 It would also increase the deterrent of being imprisoned once people understood that they would be imprisoned abroad over a certain length of sentence. This would also help to end the early release of offenders due to pressure of space on our prison system. What about our rights? I hear the wrong doers and their allies cry, I believe you forfeit some of your rights at the moment you break the law - this issue should be examined and discussed by those qualified, and a decision made. What about the rights of the tax payer, and the victim?",
