        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The goverment recently increased the penalty for using a mobile phone whilst driving a vehicle to 3 penalty points and a \u00a360 fine. \nI propose that this is increased to \u00a3500 and 9 penalty points or at least increase the current tariff.\nSince the introdution I see dozens of drivers every day using phones whilst driving which displays a complete and utter disregard for the law and the safety of those around them, the reason? The chances of being caught are extremely slim and if you are? well not really a problem, a few points and the cost of a pair of jeans!\n If the fine was increased dramatically and you added enough points to risk the loss of a license there would be alot more forthought by these irresponsible people. \nLets make the rules stick and save lives that should never be lost.",
