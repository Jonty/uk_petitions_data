            "background": "The UK does little to support young people particularly compared to most other EU countries.  Is there any surprise that young people hang about on street corners, get into trouble, turn to gangs, violence and even terrorism?  \n\nNot all families are good; not all families can support their children and children are frequently alienated by their parents' lack of interest.  They naturally want to be with their peers.\n\nWe build entertainment complexes everywhere - even casinos it seems - but only build youth facilities in the very worst areas.\n\nWe demand sustained investment in a nationwide programme to build and support youth facilities with training for workers.  This should be both part of the education/sports system and outside it, within both public and charitable sectors. \n\nYoung people are not just the future - they are future voters and will become even more disullusioned with politics and society if we continue to treat them with such disrespect.",
