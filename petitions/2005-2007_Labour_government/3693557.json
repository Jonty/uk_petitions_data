            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Our system of paying various & numerious tax's, many based on income or expenditure rather than benefit recieved, is completely unfair to all (particularly the people who are prepared to work hard for a living).  This taxation should be replaced with a system where everybody in the UK, be them permenant or temporary, is given a single, detailed, bill for what it costs to live in the UK.  Having a detailed bill will also allow the people of the UK to see where our money is spent, and can make informed choices about our leadership.  Using this system would dramatically reduce the number of government bodies and employees who currently collect various tax's and therefore further reduce costs.",
