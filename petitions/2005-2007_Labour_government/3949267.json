            "background": "The dartford tunnel toll was initially started as a temporary means to raise money for the Queen Elizabeth Bridge. This soon became a permanent fixture with no apparent reasoning after the bridge was created. A new proposal is suggested to raise the toll by a third to \u00a311.50...with on coming road pricing and endless tolls, surely increasing road costs on evey level is unfair to the motorist particularly those who use this particualr road to go to work.",
