            "background": "Hampshire County Council has nominated the 40 acre Forest Lodge Farm (NFT 018, NFT 034) for Gravel extraction (1.7 million tonnes) and subsequent Landfill (625,000 cubic Metres).\n\nForest Lodge Farm is the only natural open space left between Furzedown and Hardley and forms a strategic gap between the industrial estate and thousands of people in a residential area. The site is in the historic parkland of Forest Lodge. It is adjacent to area\u2019s of environmental value including a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI), a Special Protected Area (SPA), a Special Area of Conservation (SAC) and RAMSAR site.\n\nThe proposed perimeter borders Hart Hill, Fawley Road (A326) and Furzedown Farm Conservation Area. This misuse of land will result in high levels of noise and dust during extraction, and subsequent noise, dust, smells, vermin and blown litter together with greatly increased traffic levels when the site becomes a landfill.\n\nPlease help stop this by giving your support to the petition.",
