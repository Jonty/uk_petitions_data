            "background": "In the last election the number of votes required for a seat depended on what party you were. Of the big 3 (and its worse for the smaller ones) the third place required 4x as many votes, and the second twice as many votes for each seat won.\nIt isn't democratic to have an overwhelming parliamentary majority on a quarter of the votes cast.\nIt also means that it is difficult to justify turning out to vote when your vote can count for so little.\nWe need a system where we end up with representation in parliament more representative of the way people vote. To hide behind the excuse that we vote for our MP's is not acceptable when the MP's all (well almost all) do just what the party 'whips' (aka the leader) tells them to. \nIn fact at the moment we really only need a parliament of one person - he tells the largest party how to vote, and even if all the other MP's gang up they can't stop it. \nThis isn't democracy.",
