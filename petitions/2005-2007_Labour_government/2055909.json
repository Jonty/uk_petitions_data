        "background": "In an attempt to relieve traffic congestion, we ask the goverment to supply free school buses like they do in the US, I have noticed a massive decrease in traffic in the mornings and afternoons when the schools are on holiday and have been a frequent vistor to the US all my life and noticed how well the scheme works over there. It is so obvious how much less traffic there would be in the mornings and afternoons if we got rid of all of the parents driving their children to and from school",
