It gives them excellent Medical care with dedicated hospitals,help to integrate back to civilian society and also the right to a Military funeral and burial in National Cemeteries. It is the debt of honour which a grateful nation places on the service to your country and does not expire until death befalls the person.The UK appears not to have such a concept of debt and gratitude for its military, who are increasingly working in difficult areas on OUR behalf - even if we may disagree with the politics - we still owe them a debt of gratitude and should honour it.",
