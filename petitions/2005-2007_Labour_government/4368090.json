        "background": "I was appalled recently to open up 'The Sun' and find a cartoon that encourages and suggests that Steve Maclaren should shoot himself over the recent form of the england team. The sky sports team at the end of the Andorra match were right in saying that the FA should give more protection to the manager and I think the government should also. Our nation condemns bullying and tries to teach our children it is wrong, but our media has been reduced to this and I feel extremely sorry for maclaren and the players. How are we supposed to be good role models for our kids and teach them that bullying is wrong, when it goes on in our newspapers all of the time.\nWe are all entitled to free speech but I dont think our media has any right to taunt and bully anyone. They have no respect for the england team and its manager.\nThis has to stop before it ends up going too far and people think it is ok to bully and disrespect not only our football teams but the people around us. I think our media has been shamefull and something should be done about this NOW!",
