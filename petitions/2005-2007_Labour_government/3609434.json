        "background": "Dolphins are being slaughtered mainly for pet food, very little enters the human food chain as there is to much murcury in their flesh. These dolphins are herded into small bays and stabbed to death, sometimes a very slow agonising death.\nFour hundred thousand dolhins have been killed in the last two decades.\nThe Japenese claim that they do this because of tradition. Please help to put a stop to this barbarity.",
