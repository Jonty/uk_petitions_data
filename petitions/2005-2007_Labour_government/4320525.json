            "action": "Consider the closure of the Stafford Day Service which caters for mentally and physically handicapped people.   The council have decided with very little consideration to close this much needed facility.   The people who attend have varying degrees of handicap but are all mentally handicapped.   They need the \"special place\" where they can meet with, what is in effect an extended family, the Staff are dedicated and caring and enrich the lives of the Service Users.  Apparently there will be money available to \"buy in\" care/help - but there is excellent care available at present.   Can't think who said it but \"why mend it if it aint broken\".",
