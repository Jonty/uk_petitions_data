            "background": "Having an Ultrasound scan can be a source of some anxiety. They are designed to pick up potential problems.\n\nIf problems are found early enough it helps parents have the chance to get support,even may include ending the pregnancy, or preparing for the birth of a baby who needs special care. \n\nBecause of my postcode, the govenment states that I am only allowed one ultrasound scan at approx 16 weeks, which is only a dating scan, not a detailed anomaly scan.\n\nI cant afford these fees. I also dont feel I could personally cope looking after disabled child/adult for the rest of my life, and for it to have to go in to care when anything happens to me. \n\nWe want the right antenatal care where ever you live in the UK and to help the NHS too by reducing the long list of unwanted babies that spend their life with an a hospital ward because they are too sick to live a normal happy life and the parents never given the choice but to have this responsibilty and guilt for the rest of their lives.",
