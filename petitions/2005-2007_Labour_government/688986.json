            "background": "Following 30 x years plus within the licensing sector of the hospitality industry, I am disgusted in the way in which a sensible law is rarely if ever up-held (It is an offence to serve any person who is or apears to be DRUNK,it is also an offence to serve a person on behalf of some one who apears to be or is DRUNK).In new amendments to the licensing The only change is that both the Licensee and the person who serves are liable(up-to \u00a31000 fine). Enforcing this law would reduce :Crime - street crime, road crime,domestic crime. \nEnforcing this law would reduce :The N.H.S.bill, Alcohol related ilnesses,Alcohol related accidents and injured victims of alcohol related crime.\nThe cost to the British Police Force and our Prison Service should be utilised to improve the service given and not policing an area that is already governed but not enforced.",
