        "background": "The playing of music through mobile phone speakers is rapidly becoming a major irritant on public transport. You can now rarely take a journey on a London Bus without somebody playing music through the speakers on their phone, not using headphones.\n\nThere is a solution- forcing mobile phone companies to disable the software that allows music to be played without headphones would stop the problem at source without stopping people listening to music. \n\nA software fix would be possible and would force people to wear headphones if they wished to listen to music.\n\nThe Mobile Phone industry should be threatened with legislation to ban music players on mobile phones unless they implement this simple fix themselves",
