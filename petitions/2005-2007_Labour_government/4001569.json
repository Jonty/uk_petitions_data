            "background": "Zimbabe now has unemployment above 80%, inflation of more than 1700%, a leader with no legitimate control, opposition leaders being savagely beaten, and an economy that hovers at the point of complete collapse. Agriculture has been savaged by Mugabe's land grabs, many have been driven from their homes or even from the country. As this country is part of the Commonwealth, we believe the Government must intervene, militarily if necessary, to ensure a return to acceptable values, including the rights for freedom of movement and expression. The British Government must intervene urgently to avert a major humanitarian crisis.",
