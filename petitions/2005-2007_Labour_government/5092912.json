            "background": "84 year old Tul Bahadur Pun fought with honour for this country with the Gurkha's during WW2 earning the highest gallantry award we can bestow on an individual - the Victoria Cross. Now due to ill health he wishes to return to the UK from Nepal for treatment and to spend time with old comrades. His entry has been denied because \"he cannot prove strong ties to the UK\", he won the VC fighting for this country - is that not proof enough! We urge the Prime Minister to step in on this issue and give this hero the recognition & help he so badly needs.",
