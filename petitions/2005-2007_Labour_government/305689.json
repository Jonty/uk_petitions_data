Do we wait before it's to late and act now or do we want our kids to be able to enjoy a countryside and be able to drink water? Taxation would be 1000\u00a3 per baby born after the second one is born. I do understand the natural instinct off a mother  to have babies, but you have to look at it in the whole.Global warming and other factors need to be tackled at the root to before it's to late. This taxation could always be stopped if the population would be the majority off it are elders.",
