        "background": "How should new arrivals prove their commitment to citizenship?\n\nImmigrants should carry out community work before being granted UK citizenship, Chancellor Gordon Brown is expected to say in a seminar on Britishness.\n\nMr Brown believes this idea would demonstrate to society that migrants will contribute.\n\nThe chancellor's comments follow his earlier call for immigrants to learn English and for the UK to have a day to celebrate national identity.\n\nI THINK THIS IS A JOKE. WHAT ABOUT THE DAY TO DAY INVOLMENT OF MIGRANTS AT THE WORK PLACE, TUBE STATION, SCHOOL, MARKET, SUPERMARKET, THE COURTS, SPORTS GROUNDS, SCHOOLS ETC. I THINK THIS IS RIDICULOUS AND NEEDS RETHINKING BY GORDON. WHAT A SHAME THIS IS WHAT HE CAME UP WITH INSTEAD OF SOME CONSTRUCTIVE POLICY TOWARDS INTEGRATION AND EMBRACING MULTICULTRALISM.",
