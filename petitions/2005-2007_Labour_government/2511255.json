        "background": "We all loathe the idea of paying more tax, but why should those who use the roads not pay for them? Makes sense doesn't it. I don't pay for next doors food bills, so why should I pay for their three cars? Road pricing is difficult, but our climate tipping point isn't far off. Sign this petition to say we need to look at new ways to reduce car transport.",
