            "background": "Due to controversy created by those who have not in fact played or properly looked at the videogame Rule or Rose, such as the Daily Mail or the mayor of Rome, the publisher, 505 Games, have bowed to popular hysteria and withdrawn it from sale; despite the comments of the Video Standards Council that the game was suitable for sale and that the media coverage was \"grossly inaccurate\", and \"completely made up\".\n\nWe believe that, given the fundamental rights of Freedom of Expression and the previously enlightened British views on censorship, that the prime minster should strike a blow against right-wing tabloid hysteria and ill-informed public attitudes by issuing a statement of support for the judgement of the Video Standards Council and denouncing this tabloid hysteria\n\nPlease show your support for free expression by adding your name, and preventing tabloid hysteria from ruining our culture.",
