Many foreign drivers do not have current licence and insurance, and many HGV drivers do not comply with drivers' hours restrictions, leading to many serious accidents. Most, if not all, foreign registered vehicles do not have \"left dipping\" headlights, and do not comply with other basic UK vehicle regulations. The Continental police strictly enforce \"on the spot\" fines and vehicle impounding. Why not here?",
