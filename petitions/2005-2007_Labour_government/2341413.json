            "background": "I would ask the government to do away with the restrictive speed governed at 58mph on HGV's. Most of accidents on motorways are caused by sudden backing up of traffic. When all of a sudden the traffic suddenly slows right down to a crawling pace, or a complete stand still. up the front of all this you will normally find two lorries, one trying to overtake the other. Which has caused other vehicles to change lanes and take evasive action, thus causing other vehicles to swerve or slow down excessively.  If you need to have a restricted speed then make it 70mph. 99.9% of british HGV lorry drivers are highly responsible, professional and highly tallented drivers. Where as most continental drivers, lorries arnt restricted. at this time of writing this i belieive the information to be correct.",
