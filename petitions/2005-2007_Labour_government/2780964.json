            "background": "Thank you and Welcome to this worthy petition.\nI strongly believe that the Government should re-assess the dole system. It is grossly unfair that people get paid for not working if they are not eligible. Everybody can contribute something to society and should be encouraged to do so. People who abuse the system should be made to repay those tax payers in someway, if not cash, then offer labour to the country. It is an insult to those who fought for freedom and those who wake up everyday to work hard and put something back, in order to make the country work.",
