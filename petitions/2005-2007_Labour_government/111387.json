        "background": "Many other beloved institutions have been sold off,why not peerages? Sell them openly and use the money to complement the \nnational lottery's \"good causes\". This way we can do away with the nasty allegations of \"favours\" and \"corruption\" and the like.\n\nHowever, in order to make sure that the price of a peerage is not beyond\nthe reach of everyone in our society we should sell them cheaply. \n\nI propose a quid a go. A pound a peerage should do it. And to make the purchase as simple and accessible as possible they should be sold at news agents, from a dispenser next to the lottery scratch cards. That way anyone could walk up to the counter and ask for \" Twenty B and H, a lighter and a Companion of the Order of the Bath  please.\"",
