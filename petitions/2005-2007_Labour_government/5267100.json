        "background": "I have suffered from Multiple Sclerosis since the age of 16, I am now 23. Up until now all the medications I have been supplied with have done wonders but over the last year my condition has somewhat deteriorated. I have been told about a new medication called Tysabri which compared to the normal 30% this has a 66% success rate, medical trials were conducted to see the cost effectivness of Tysabri, the effectivness of the drug was not taken into consideration. Although it has been proven that the drug is a miracle drug it has also been said that it is not cost effective. At present only people who live in certain boroughs are offered treatment, a kind of postcode lottery, so I am putting this petition together to forward on to NICE, The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence, to help fight the case for me and many other Multiple Sclerosis sufferers.",
