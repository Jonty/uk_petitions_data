The lack of security in Iraq which the Coalition has failed to remedy to date, has created some 2million or more refugees for which the UN notes the UK has failed to offer asylum to sufficient numbers of Iraqis.\n\nThe UK must endeavour to meet these obligations of international law and humanitarian conscience and grant access to at least the number of Iraqi refugees implied by the United Nations.",
