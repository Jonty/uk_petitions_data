It is nondescript and an embarrassment to our country. \n\nThe logo is based on \"youf\" culture and designed around graffiti, however the Olympics are being underwritten by us, the taxpayers and this petition is to ask the government to lobby the London Olympic Committee to scrap the ridiculous logo and design one which is fit for purpose and world class.  \n\nI am proud that the Olympics are coming to Britain it is for that very reason that I have started this petition to scrap the logo.",
