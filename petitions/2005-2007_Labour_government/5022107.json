        "background": "more benefits for mums to be taking time off work for maternity leave - like me at present! the maternity pay allowance is pathetic. i dont know how mums to be are expected to cope on this sort of allowance after having been used to a monthly salary.  not all of us have savings, i certainly don't. its hard enough to pay every month the mortgage, household bills, and also having to buy things for my baby. more benefits should be available to assist us. i am 34 years old, this is my first baby, and most girls want a family of their own, its only natural, and we shouldn't be penalised especially as i have worked my ass off all my life in fulltime employment, paid all my taxes and national insurance since I was 16 years old - then i am supposed to live on a measley 112pound per week maternity leave allowance.  it is disgusting.",
