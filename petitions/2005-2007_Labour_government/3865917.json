Given the proposed increases in the local precept over the coming months surely we should be entitled to accountability where the service lets us down.  If a bin collection is missed - we must put up with a full bin until the next collection, we must put our rubbish in a bag next to our bin - but we are not entitled to a refund as these services are not individually accountable.  We pay for these services - if we are let down for services we pay for in good faith, we should be entitled to claim a proportion of what we have paid back.",
