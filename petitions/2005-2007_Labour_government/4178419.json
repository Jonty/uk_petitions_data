            "background": "The proposer recognizes that many people, through exercising their personal choice to use four wheel drive vehicles, are potentially damaging our environment through increased carbon emissions. However there exists a need for people living in areas of the country that are not provided with a good road infrastructure who must utilise four wheel drive technology in order to maintain the ability to work and carry out those tasks that the vast majority of the population take for granted, such as access to hospitals, schools, shops and public services.  These individuals are often denied any access to public transport and any further taxes on four wheel drive vehicles would further disadvantage them. Any taxation system should take account of need over personal choice.",
