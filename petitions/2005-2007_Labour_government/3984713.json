        "background": "On 3rd March 2007 another Reunion was held at the University of Bedfordshire Student Union, for people who graduated from the University (then called the University of Luton) between 2000-2006. Over 300 people attended and had an amazing night and got to be reunited with each other. The night was an overwhelming success due to the hard work, months of planning, searching for people and updates by a variety of websites by both Nathan Spencer and Leah O'Mahoney (Both graduates of the University and former members of staff at the Student Union). \n\nThis event also brought a great deal of revenue to the local economy over the duration of that weekend, with hotels, bars and restaurants all benefiting from the sudden surge in people. We believe their hard work and commitment should be recognised by awarding them MBEs when the next honours list is announced.",
