        "background": "After completing a higher education course, the average student is expected to leave with over \u00a320,000 of debt.  With many contributors including increasing tuition fees, living expenses I propose that graduates should be given the opportunity to offset their student loan repayments against their income tax for a maximum period.  As a minimum this should at least cover the monthly interest.\n\nThis would allow a period where graduates could see their debt reducing, and potentially increase contributions to the British economy and allow them to enter the housing market.",
