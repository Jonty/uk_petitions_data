        "background": "The budget has increased again.  The Games will now cost nine thousand million having increased from two thousand million.  We cannot rely on the politicians whose estimates increased by four in a few months.  The latest budget will rise again.  Only by increasing tax and raiding the National Lottery, depriving worthy charities of much-needed funds, can the money be found to pay for this unwanted event.  Taxpayers will pay much more tax for years to come to cover the cost.  Cancel the Games and pay the damages charged.   This will be far cheaper than the final, unknown cost.  Use the money saved to improve the NHS, on education, transport, the police and giving our armed forces the badly needed resources to fight the wars they are engaged in.  We did not ask for the Games to be held here.  We had no opportunity to vote for or against them.  Our politicians, members of unelected quangos and the International Olympic Committee foisted them on us.  Vote to cancel the London Olympic Games.",
