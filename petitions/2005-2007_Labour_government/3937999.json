            "background": "This petition urges the Government to bring forward British Summer time to the second Sunday in March, in line with what the USA and Canada have done this year in 2007.\n\nThis will also give our country longer days for much of the year especially longer springs. Winter time is currently prolonged more than required.\n\nThis will make our country greener by consuming less energy than would normally be used.",
