Do their parents have no consideration at all for their fellow passengers? Evidently not. There might be a good case for enforced stupefaction, but surely a more sensible solution would be for the selfish parents to consider the plight of others (otherwise known as altruism) and not take children on board until they knew how to behave. Of course, given the curse of the modern parent, we may never get there.",
