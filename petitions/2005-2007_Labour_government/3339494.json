Pedestrians should have right of way/priority over all other road users - for example at junctions.   Bicycles and motorbikes should have right of way / priority over cars & lorries.",

            "background": "100's of preventable deaths & serious injuries occur on our roads\n\nHow many lives could be saved by adopting a new priority system used in countries like Germany where:\n\n- cars MUST give way to bikes\n\n- cars & bikes MUST give way to pedestrians\n\n- Pedestrians have right of way/priority over all other road users e.g. at junctions\n\nToo many children/teens on a phone & parents pushing buggies have to sprint over side roads between speeding cars\n\nBicycles & motorbikes should have right of way/priority over cars & lorries\n\nWHY? safer, more polite, makes drivers take full responsibility for  dangerous vehicle under their control in all conditions\n\nIt would take time to trial & implement, but surely lives saved & road safety awareness would be worth it! & more might cycle- more healthy + less congestion!\n\nCertain towns/cities could be invited to trial the system with large posters/leaflets to explain it.  Start with Garrison towns where many are used to driving in Germany",
