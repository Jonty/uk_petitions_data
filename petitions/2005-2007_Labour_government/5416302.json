            "background": "We feel that the government is failing home educated children by not allowing them free and easy access to G.C.S.E's, unless they attend full time government run establishments. This is denying a vast amount of home educated children their basic right to education and qualifications. We feel home educated children should be allowed to sit exams and have course work verified free of charge, like other children who attend school. We feel that forcing parents to pay for these exams is socially desciminating home educated children from the work place and higher education.",
