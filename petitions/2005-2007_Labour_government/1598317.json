This way, they can:\n\n* rebuild our railways\n* maintain our motorways\n* clean up our cities\n* construct the Olympic Village\n* recycle our waste\n* AND learn useful construction and maintenance skills, which can be converted into some sort of award/certificate of achievement, facilitating their ability to gain honest employment upon their release.",
