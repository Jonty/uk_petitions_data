            "background": "As a professional Firefighter of 22 years and regular commuter on the M40, I am simply appalled by the driving standards of some motorists with regard to lane discipline. (Rule No 238)\nThe Department for Transport's new congestion target challenge is to make journeys more reliable on the strategic road network by 2007-08. In meeting this target, they are focusing their efforts on improving the efficiency of the existing network by using innovative equipment and management techniques - keeping traffic flowing smoothly.\nHopefully this will include making it an offence to continually ignore rule No 238.\nApart from the obvious contribution of improving congestion, a more rigorous enforcement of the rule would most certainly improve on the number of RTC (Road traffic collisions) and could significantly reduce road accident casualties. Or near misses that I frequently witness through drivers maneuvering around our friends in the middle lane. \nBy simple compliance with the Highway Code, our economy, quality of life and environment will be improved.",
