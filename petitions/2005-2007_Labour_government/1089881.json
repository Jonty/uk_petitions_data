The decision to close Haslar came about as a result of a review of Defence Medical Services in 1997/1998, however, Haslar's caseload is 80% civilian and it is heavily relied upon by the local community. The hospital has served the civilian population of the area and also the Army, Navy and Air Force for many years, and in view of recent comments and the scarcity of facilities for treatment of Military cases in a Military environment, we believe that Haslar Hospital should be retained at full strength.",
