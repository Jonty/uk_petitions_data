            "background": "Whether you liked or loathed a certain book Salman Rushdie wrote almost 20 years ago or not is not the issue here. The issue is, should the UK be trading with a country who\u2019s Government has so openly endorsed the use of suicide bombers on a British citizen for whose only supposed crime was to put pen to paper. I am not attacking the right for Muslims to be offended and to voice their distaste; however, condoning the taking of a person\u2019s life, especially from members in the upper echelons of the Government of Pakistan, is a step too far. If you agree with me on this matter, please sign this petition.",
