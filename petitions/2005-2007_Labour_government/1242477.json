The term asain is given to asian brits but there not asain if there born in europe, once again stupid!. I suggest we have the following - \nBritsh followed by the ethnic group, or not britsh if not a british citizen:\nWhite, Black, Brown (to replace asain, this is popular amoung British asian youth), Oriental (to replace chinese, this is also popular already in the UK), Hispanic (not currently recodnized but needs to be as this is a race), Mixed-race (e.g Mixed white-black est)and Other. So ethnic groups in the UK will be under the term e.g. British black or other Black, British oriental or other oriental est.",
