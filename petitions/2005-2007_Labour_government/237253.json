            "background": "We suggest that Section 106 of the Town & Country Planning Act, which permits local authorities to effectively 'sell' planning consents, is an institutionally corrupt piece of legislation, which provides local authorities with an incentive to allow inappropriate development, against the common interest.  We also suggest that the spirit in which the original act was passed has been misinterpreted by the current administration, to the end that supply of housing is now at it's most restricted, effectively making an artificial commodity out of land.",
