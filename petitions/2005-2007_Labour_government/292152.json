Stop wasting our money on training courses that serve no purpose.\n\nThe New Deal training courses are now a proven waste of tax-payers' money:\n\nThere are now 37,000 more unemployed people aged 16 to 24 than in May 1997, with the total rising from 665,000 to 702,000, according to the Office for National Statistics. \n\nAs of December 2006, the unemployment rate has risen to 14.5 per cent among young people, overtaking the 14.4 per cent Labour inherited from the Tory Government.",
