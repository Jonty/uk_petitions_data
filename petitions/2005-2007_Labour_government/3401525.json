        "background": "If car road tax was to be scrapped and duty increased on petrol this would ensure that everyone who runs a car would pay into the coffers. People who do not have road tax whould have to pay as they need petrol to get around and 4x4 owners would have to pay more as their cars are gas guzzlers. All in all it is a much better idea than road tax.",
