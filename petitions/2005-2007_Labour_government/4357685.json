            "background": "To carry out a trial period whereby winter is GMT +1, equivalent to British Summer Time, and summer is GMT +2. \n\nA similar trial to the one carried out in 1968/71\n\nI would suggest a good time for this would be from 2010 to 2013, which would take in to account the 2012 Olympics.\nAllot less energy would be consumed here.\n\nThe UK is a signatory to the Kyoto agreement, and is committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions, a move to SDST would help to achieve the target for reducing carbon emissions.\n\nA boost in tourism revenue would be a grate benefit too with the longer daylight hours, and also a dramatic decrease in Road accidents.\n\nIf this didnt work for Scotland, being so far north, they could stick to the same time zone but could work around it.",
