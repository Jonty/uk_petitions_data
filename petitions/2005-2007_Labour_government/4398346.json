        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This year marks 200 years since the abolition of the slave trade, yet a formal apology has never been sanctioned.  The people who were enslaved where subjected to the most horrific lifestyles imaginable and treated as if soulless beings, beaten, tortured, raped, seperated from family and even their own children and literally worked until they dropped.  A simple apology will never change what atrocities were comitted during the slave trade but is well deserved and is recognition that what our ancesters did during these times was wrong.  No man has the right to control or even take another mans life not now and certainly not then.  As it has been 200 years since the abolition it seems that an apology has been lost in these years but still should be made no matter how long ago it was.\n\nPlease vote for a formal apology to be made to the people who's ancesers were enslaved in this country.",
