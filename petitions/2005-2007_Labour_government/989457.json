            "background": "If the Government is truly concerned with the publics health, and weight related illness, they should be providing a subsidy to those of us who want to do something about our health and fitness but cannot afford the high cost of joining a health and fitness centre or gymnasium. A voucher scheme to encourage people to get fit would help tackle the growing problem of obesity and the health problems it causes. The government also need to investigate the Local Authority practice of charging high fees for car parking at their sports centres. This must also disuade many people from using the facilities provided by said Local Authorities.",
