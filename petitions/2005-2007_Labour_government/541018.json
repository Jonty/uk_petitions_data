            "background": "Once it was only those who owned stately homes who had to worry about inheritance tax. \nRising house prices mean your heirs could be landed with a massive tax bill for a standard semi-detached house. \nOnce a house is valued above \u00a3285,000, it is liable for IHT. Which includes a large proportion of Great Britain.\nCampaigners hope that Chancellor Gordon Brown might be moved by the pleas of people such as Dorothy and Sue, but Ed Balls, the economic secretary to the Treasury, seems unmoved.\nMr Balls said the government planned to increase the threshold to \u00a3325,000 by 2008. But for many families, there is the fear that it will not keep pace with the burgeoning property market.",
