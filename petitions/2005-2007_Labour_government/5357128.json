            "background": "The great thing about Britain is its diverse population and its tolerance of all believes and religions. Although we did not like Rushdie's old book, The Satanic Verses, we respected that the book represented his personal opinions. In this great society, we acknowledge that everyone has the right in expressing his opinions in whichever way he thought appropriate. Honouring Rushdie at this particular time, we fear will deepen the sense of injustice among the Muslim population and risk damaging consequences. We fear that this honour will be translated by many Muslims, wrongly, as a reward to that old book, which was perceived as an attack on Islam. \nWe love our Britain and our Queen; we do not want them to be looked at in a negative way by anybody. We think that the decision to honour him was a wrong one and it should be reconsidered.\nthis honour should be stripped of him.",
