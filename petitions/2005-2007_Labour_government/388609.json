        "background": "Wards and departments are closing. Nurses, doctors and other NHS staff are being made redundant. The Secretary of State for Health tries to pretend that this does not detract from patient care whilst continuing to squander billions of pounds on a flawed, unwanted and intrusive computer system, which does not work. This is all in the name of \"choice\" which the government's own survey showed was not a priority for the public. It is years behind schedule and massively over-budget with the potential for very intimate information to be seen by many people.",
