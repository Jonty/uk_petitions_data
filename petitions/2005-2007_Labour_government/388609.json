The Secretary of State for Health tries to pretend that this does not detract from patient care whilst continuing to squander billions of pounds on a flawed, unwanted and intrusive computer system, which does not work. This is all in the name of \"choice\" which the government's own survey showed was not a priority for the public. It is years behind schedule and massively over-budget with the potential for very intimate information to be seen by many people.",
