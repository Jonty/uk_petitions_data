            "background": "Vulture funds are making a mockery of debt relief. The promises made by governments to cancel third world debts, which sounded so promising when announced by the G8 leaders, are being exploited by companies who are able to make millions at the expense of the poorest people in the world. \nDebts can be bought and sold just like any other commodity. Hence when a debt is reduced, to ease the burden on a poor country, it becomes attractive for companies to buy that debt at the reduced price. The company can then sue the country for the original amount that was borrowed, and in many cases for interest and costs as well, making a massive profit. Currently the practice is completely legal and is costing countries such as Zambia millions of dollars that could otherwise have been spent on health and education.",
