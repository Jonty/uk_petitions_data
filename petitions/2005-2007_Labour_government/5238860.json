        "background": "With farmers under ever increasing pressure to diversify their sources of income and increasing levels of obesity in young people it seems that encouraging sport in the countryside is an obvious way forward, yet those individuals looking to set up new facilities in the countryside are often held back by the difficulties of obtaining planning permission and working around other regulations.\n\nFacilities for sports like downhill mountain biking, mountain boarding and many others are environmentally friendly, encourage an active lifestyle and bring much needed revenue to the countryside but can often be prevented by the objections of, for example, small groups within neighboring communities.\n\nThis petition calls for the prime minister to publicly encourage the granting of planning permission to these forms of projects and wherever possible reduce the red tape involved.",
