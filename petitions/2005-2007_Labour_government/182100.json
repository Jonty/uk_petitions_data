The houses are often damp, cold, in need of repairs, and generally unsuitable for living in. All this whilst still expecting the serving members to fight and risk their lives overseas while their families live in appalling conditions. SURELY THIS SHOULD BE MORE OF A PRIORITY THAN TOP RATE ACCOMODATION FOR ASYLUM SEEKERS. Give our boys and girls what they deserve for such a sterling job- sterling housing!",
