            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In the UK we have a fixed speed limit and cameras to detect it, I believe the primeminster should replace speed cameras on motorways and A roads with computerised cameras that detect space between cars and irratic driving rather than speed. Following two metres behind someone at 50 is far more dangerous than doing 120 on an open road. As part of this move, all motorways should be given a variable speed limit between 0mph and a high figure such as 120mph. These limits would be set depending on time of day, congestion, active road works, and so on.",
