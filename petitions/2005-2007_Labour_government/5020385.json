            "background": "I feel that many of these magazines result in problems we are facing today.  They give out false information and show us nothing but negativity.  Our children read them and then base there lifes ambitions upon being like someone who was in them.  It shows \"CELEBRITIES\" who are supposed to set an example, doing the complete opposite.  Due to this I feel we have lost who we are and who we aspire to be as individuals.  This is why I think all gossip magazines should be banned.",
