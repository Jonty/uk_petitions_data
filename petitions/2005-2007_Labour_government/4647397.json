            "background": "There is endless debate about BST and who wins and loses. I think the biggest winners are the press who bang on about it every year.\nBring an end to it all this year please by simply turning the clocks back by 30 minutes instead of the 1 hour and then LEAVE IT THERE.\nNo spring forward and fall back ever again.\nNo worries about the computers as the biggest player in the field recently released a 'patch' for all American systems when their government moved the 2007 'spring forward' back a couple of weeks.\nPlease sign my petition and persuade Mr Blair (or his successor) and his (or her) hard working staff to consider our plea.",
