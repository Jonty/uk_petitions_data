The Theatre is near completion and Dr. Engelbert Humperdinck's name has already been mentioned as a potential candidate.  Dr. Engelbert solely holds the title, \"Son of Leicester\" which makes him the ideal choice for this naming, not to mention that his contribution to the Arts and Entertainment field find him most suitable for this category.  I kindly ask the people of Leicester to raise their support efforts in accomplishing this magnificent tribute to their one and only \"Son\"....How deseving an appeal to have this announcement be made during his 40th year in the entertainment field.  I thank you!",
