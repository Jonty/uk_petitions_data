            "background": "Academics calculate that 30 million would be an optimum population for Britain. It would allow us greater self-sufficiency and reduce pollution and hopefully ease global warming. Road pricing and congestion charging could be abandoned and overcrowded roads, trains, airports, prisons etc would diminish. Young people would have better housing choice. Measures like stopping net immigration with public education and tax changes that encourage smaller families could achieve this painlessly and there would still be enough people around to make friends with.\nInsist on quality of life not quantity !",
