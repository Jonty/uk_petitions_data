        "background": "We believe,\n\u2022 Education is the greatest determinant of social mobility.\n\u2022 Lifting the cap on top-up fees will escalate the marketisation of education.\n\u2022 Because one thing we know about markets is that people with less money buy cheaper products, this will lead to entry being dependent on affordability rather than ability.\n\u2022 This will further increase the gap in society between the premium educated rich and the economy educated poor.\n\nHence, we want:\n\u2022 The cap on University top-up fees to be kept at \u00a33,000.\n\u2022 Fair access to education - entry on ability not affordability.\n\u2022 You to add your voice to the campaign right here!",
