That might not sound much, but it will result in the library cutting its opening hours dramatically, and charging a fee to use the reading rooms. \n\nIf you believe that to be a truly British Library, the library services the BL provides should be free of charge to the user - then sign the petition!\n\nThe BL is a truly world class institution, and one which belongs to all of us. We have a duty of care to support it, for the benefit of future generations. Please, Mr Blair, don't cut its budget!",
