            "background": "1)That its \"Partition\" documentary which was broadcast on several occasions since 12/03/2007 has caused hurt and upset to the Sikh community as evidenced by this petition\n2)That the documentary as broadcast is considered by the Sikh community to be in breach of the Ofcom Broadcasting Code as pertaining to fairness & balance\n3)That the documentary as broadcast is considered by the Sikh community to be outright racist in its treatment of the Sikhs (particularly insofar as it was stated expressly by one person in the documentary that compared to Muslims & Hindus who supposedly had more foresight & intelligence, the Sikhs would only see a storm & act on it \"after it had passed\")\n4)That the documentary as broadcast is perceived by the Sikh community to have offered a highly skewed & misleading account of the actual events of 1947, as a result of the failure of the programmers to research the subject matter accurately by consulting sufficiently with contemporary Sikh community leaders prior to producing the programme\n5)That Channel4 ought to have carried out an analysis of the effect on community relations of this documentary, before being broadcast in the form in which it appeared",
