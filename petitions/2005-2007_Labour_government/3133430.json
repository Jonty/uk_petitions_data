        "background": "I believe that the government should make medical degrees more accessible to those who would like to study it. For example, more 'Access to Medicine' courses should be made available around the country to allow older people who may have not studied A-levels or did not do as well as expected to enter the medical profession. \n\nThe NHS has said that we need to double the number of consultants that are working in the health service by 2010, however if the current level of training carries on then we will be nowhere near this target, meaning that waiting lists will just continue to increase.\n\nThere are a lot of talented people who would love to become doctors but are being held back due to old fashioned requirements.",
