        "background": "The MOD and Service Childrens Education needs to be examined with a view to providing more support especially Portage Services. The  only Portage service based in Germany  is under threat of closure. There are families posted overseas who receive minimal support and provision. The MoD does not seem to have any obligation to support a preschool child with special needs or developmenal delay nor their family, In the UK Early Support applies in some areas and the Every Child Matters Agenda applies - BUT it seems not so for Service families.",
