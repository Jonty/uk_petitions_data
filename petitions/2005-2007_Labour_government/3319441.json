        "action": "guarantee and ring fence any future taxes levied by road taxation, fuel excise duty and road pricing schemes to be ploughed back into the development of the road and rail infrastructure as well as targeted increased investment into public transport. We demand a transport infrastructure fit for the 21st Century.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Government must show even-handedness in how increased investment will: improve public transport; reduce congestion and carbon emissions by demonstrating tangible alternatives to car usage. In tandem with an integrated transport policy, the Government needs to show creativity by encouraging alternative ways of working are acceptable; eg a World Class Broadband Network that enables greater home working (say 2 days out of 5) and less need to travel.\n\nThe perception is that the Government is overly taxing the motorist with increased stealth taxes while not providing a suitable alternative. It now needs to demonstrate this (similar to the 1% increase in NI that was ring fenced for the NHS) by producing a transport policy and infrastructure fit for the 21st century that will support and grow the economy and reduce the effects of climate change.\n\nWe need a 21st Century Marshal Plan for transportation in the UK.",
