I believe that they should not be allowed to hide behind their position and claim anonymity. I believe that they are abusing the freedom of information act and that this should be stopped. I also believe tha they should not be allowed to use the practice of refusing to communicate with members of the public. I would also like to see the  use of public money to fight the public by Civil servants abolished in cases where it is clearly wrong to do so, such as part 1 compensation in motorway projects. I would like to ask the govenment to make civil servants serve the public",
