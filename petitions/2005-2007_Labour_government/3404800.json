            "background": "Currently Universities have self-governing authority in creating their own rules and regulations (with minimal standards set by government.) This is totally unjust and creates an atmosphere of corruption.\n\nThe Government state that students can go to the OIA (the Office of Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education) with their complaints however, the OIA is a privately owned commercial company paid for solely by Universities that subscribe to them; the OIA are not monitored by the government. \n\nThe OIA do not conclude findings of student\u2019s complaints if they deem them to be of Academic Judgement; they can deem this even after a year of investigating a student\u2019s complaint.\n\nThe Government need to create Ofsted for higher education a soon as possible.\n\nWhy should the Government stop protecting students learning and the learning environment after secondary school; especially when the students pay for the tuition at University.",
