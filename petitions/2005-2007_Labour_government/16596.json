            "background": "Network Rail has some crazy plans for re-developing Kings Cross station in London.  The plans involve closing 150-year old entrances to the station on the East and North sides on York Way.  \nThis will have a terrible effect on the thousands of local people who live and work on that side of the station - forcing them to walk down dangerous streets to get to the other side of the new station complex.  Local views from Islington have been completley ignored by Network Rail, despite polite and well organised lobbying by residents, Councillors and planning officials.  Camden Council will take the initial planning decision.",
