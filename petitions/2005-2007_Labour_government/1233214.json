            "background": "Climate change has caught up on us, and we need to do something drastic so we have a future! \n\nIt worries me greatly that we used to talk about global warming not having a drastic effect in our lifetime - but now it is within the next 10 years! (and i'm only in my twenties)\n\nThe biggest change that I see we can make is to cut down on aviation, first at home and then convince other countries to follow suit. \n\nSo my petition is to limit the number of inbound and outbound UK flights, to cut the amount of carbon we are creating. Perhaps this will help reduce the number of people flying unneccesarily.",
