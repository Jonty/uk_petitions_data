I'm sure many more (especially young) drivers would then become much more aware of the consequences of getting into a crash and would be much more cautious about driving either too fast or driving recklessly as a result.\n\nVery cheap to implement, takes less than 1 minute to strap-in and experience the \"sled\" and could potentially save many, many, many lives.",
