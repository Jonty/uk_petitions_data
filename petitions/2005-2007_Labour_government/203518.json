            "background": "On 21 November 2006, PPUK had a meeting with the houses of commons about the hurdles we face. There are clearly some messages worth noting. In particular that due to breakthroughs in clinical trials and cures for cancer, over 70% of cancer is curable!  This is due to the extensive and in depth research and the many clinical trials that have evolved in treating this disease. By comparison 0% of patients sufferings with DMD are cured. This is a stark statistic and DMD affects thousands of people involved in caring and coping with the disease, including the boys who suffer from the condition. These are exciting times for the disease and the research breakthroughs provide a number of possible approaches to treating and curing DMD and other similar diseases such as Cystic Fibrosis. These approaches will be used in the possible cure of DMD and all muscular dystrophys. The bottleneck at present is the lack of future funding. Its a matter of life or death, please fund us long term! Thank you.",
