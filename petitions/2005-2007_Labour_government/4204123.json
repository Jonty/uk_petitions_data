I\ncontend that the present voting public feels similarly.\n\n I gather from the media that this parliament has gone to war, gone soft on criminals, soft on immigration, and yet seeks rises in MP\u2019s salaries and allowances! Very few of which statements the general public would disagree with.\n\nAll of which annoys those of us who pay income tax, road tax, vehicle tax, council tax, fuel tax and VAT, but have not the wherewithal to pay more increases. \nThe result being, the voter is \u2018deluded\u2019 into thinking he is getting a raw deal!\n\nThe sooner MP\u2019s realise this, they may get back some of the respect we had for them many years ago.\nPlease, support this petition, thus helping to restore \u201cGovernment by the people\u201d\n\u2026\u2026etc.",
