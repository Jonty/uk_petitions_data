        "background": "REPEAL THE UNFAIR SMOKING BAN !\nPoliticians have no right whatsoever to force landlords to ban their customers from smoking within THEIR OWN property!\nSmoking is not illegal and as such landlords have the basic right to choose whether to operate a smoking or non-smoking pub. \nThe Governments job is to educate people about the health risks of smoking but they have no right to force a ban. Just who do these politicians think they are to order people to abandon an age old LEGAL pub tradition currently enjoyed by Millions!\nA fair and simple solution is to repeal the ban, and allow landlords their rightful freedom of choice to run a smoking or non-smoking pub. People (politicians included) wishing not to smoke will naturally frequent the non-smoking pubs, and as such will no longer need to impose their opinions on people who exercise their right to smoke in a pub. \nMeanwhile the House of Commons bars will continue to allow smoking...oh the hypocrisy! Freedom of choice for all of us please!",
