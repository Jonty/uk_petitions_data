            "background": "Many people enjoy sea angling, many return home with no catch but still enjoy their day. It is absurd to charge people for this which has NOTHING to do with conservation, but is yet another revenue raising Tax. This is a total rejection of licences for sea angling and is not subject to the government producing better fish stocks as in the similar petition.",
