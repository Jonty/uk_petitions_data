        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As the current asylum system seems ill equiped to track the thousands of people who enter this country every month seeking asylum, often finding they've dissapeared 'off the radar' by the time the decision to reject their claim and deport them has been made. I believe upon arrival in this country all asylum seekers should be transported to detention centres on remote uninhabited islands, it would avoid the riots that occur in current centres due to cramped conditions as they could roam the island. But it would prevent them dissapearing into the general population, their basic rights of food, shelter and personnal safety would be met without lavishing benifits on them at great expense to the taxpayer. It would also please the 'Not In My Back Yard' fraternity by removing detention centres from populated communities and all the problems that go with them. It might also put off the non-EU economic migrants from coming here expecting rich rewards from the state.",
