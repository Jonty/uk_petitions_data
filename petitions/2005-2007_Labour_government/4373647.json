            "background": "Many careers require a good ability to discriminate between different colours. The Ishihara test plates (numbers in circles filled with dots) is the most common procedure used by employers to test colour vision. It is an extremely stringent test, and functions as a pass-fail test rather than providing a measure of the ability to discriminate between different colours. For most careers the Ishihara test is overkill.\n\nI propose that the government bans employers from using the Ishihara test, and introduces a new colour vision test that provides a measure of the ability to discriminate between colours rather than functioning as a pass-fail test.",
