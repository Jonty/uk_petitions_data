Surely it is now time for John Maynard Keynes to be formally acknowledged as the greatest ever economist. \n\nA man who single-handily revolutionised the way that we think about economic problems. The man who taught us the necessity of Government intervention to minimise the devastation of economic recession. Make this happen sooner rather than later. In the long-run, we're all dead.",
