            "background": "I am disabled, and need my car but only drive a small number of miles each year.  However, I still have to pay the full Road Fund Licence for my car.\nI believe this tax should be moved onto fuel, it would be a more equitable tax being based on mileage rather than a simple blanket tax.\nAlso, larger engined vehicles, using more fuel,  would pay the lions share.  I know this would have an effect on food and other basic costs, but I believe these costs should be minimal, and would generate greater efficiency in the use of road fuel by the transport companies.\nI fully support this motion.",
