            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I do believe that the motorist have to pay Taxes to pay for the roads but there are several problems with the current system :-\n\n1)Car Tax Dodger - So these people that are using the road but not paying for them.  This then costs the people who pay more money.  Also cost more police time tracing these people.\n\n2)Car Tax Insurance Dodger - This cost motorist more money to cover the costs of those people who don't pay.\n\n3)MOT Dodger -  If someone is going to dodge the Insurance and Car Tax then they are like to dodge this.\n\nSo I'm proposing Increasing Taxes on Fuel but scrapping the Car Tax System which will pay for the following :-\n\na)Pay for the Roads\nb)Basic Third Party Insurance,  if you need fully Comp insurance you will need to pay the extra. This is just to cover the Third Party in a accident.\n\nThe Outcome\n-----------\nMore you Drive - the more it costs.\n\nLess you Drive - Costs you Less\n\nMore Eco Friendly - Costs you Less\n\nLess Eco Friendly - Costs you More.\n\nRelease more Police Time - Can focus on those car's that aren't road worthy but these car tend to be less eco friendly so it will be costing them more.",
