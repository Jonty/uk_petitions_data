            "background": "The proportion of children living in poverty has doubled in the past generation, and in 1999 the Government committed to end child poverty by 2020.\n\nIn the latest figures (2005), 3.4 million children were living in poverty. This means that 700,000 children have been lifted out of poverty between 1998 and 2005 - a reduction of 17%. The Government's target was 25%. \n\nA report from UNICEF, released on 14 February 2007, highlighted the UK's abysmal record on child well-being. The UK as a whole needs to drastically improve its record on child well-being, and as part of that we need to redouble our efforts to end child poverty.",
