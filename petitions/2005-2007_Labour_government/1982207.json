            "background": "In recent years large numbers of public toilets have been closed down in the UK.  In many places, the only ones that remain are \"superloos\" which do not adequately meet the needs of all potential public toilet users, and which many people feel uncomfortable about using. Local authorities currently have no legal obligation to provide public toilets and see closures as an easy way of cost saving.\n\nThis causes severe problems for groups such as the elderly, pregnant women and those with various bladder and bowel conditions. It also degrades the general quality of life for all citizens.",
