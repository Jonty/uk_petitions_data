            "background": "It is the parents responsibility when they have a child. when they come out to a public place it is also thier responsibily to keep them in order. There are enough parents out thier who will happily let thier young children argue with each other on the train or let thier baby cry continously. Many more scenarios like this can be thought up It lies with the parents to stop this. all it needs is to tell the child(ren) off or feed, amuse or nappy cahnge the baby. yet many parents out there dont seem to do these things. I believe that they should take these few easy steps so that other people can enjoy themselves whan going out. At the end of the day we went out to enjoy ourselves and not to hear this.\n\nthe undersigned",
