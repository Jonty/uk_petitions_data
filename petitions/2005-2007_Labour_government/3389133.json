        "background": "The FSA recently fined the Nationwide Building Society slightly less than \u00a31m for a failing of management.  However, since this is a mutual financial institution the penalty of the fine will be met by the customers even though they have already lost out by being failed by the institution's management.  For mutual financial institutions the FSA should only have the ability to remove or apply fines to management and to force management to improve their running of the business.",
