            "background": "BBC Radio 4 are allowing certain celebrities to canvass for votes to present the Women's Hour programme in support of the Red Nose Day charity event this month (March 2007).  On R4 this morning (07 March '07), Kelvin McKenzie made a short speech asking listeners to vote for him.  Kelvin McKenzie has NEVER apologised to the people of Liverpool or supporters of Liverpool Football Club, for the untrue & unfounded allegations he made following the Hillsborough tragedy on 15 April 1989.  The BBC is a public service; I and many others like me, pay our license fee in the expectation that persons such as Kelvin McKenzie won't be allowed airtime at the very least not until he makes a full, unconditional and public apology for his untrue/spurious allegations.",
