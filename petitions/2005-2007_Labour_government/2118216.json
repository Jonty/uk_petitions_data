        "action": "Replace mortgage increases with other ways of reducing borrowing and inflation.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Raising 'interest rates' for existing borrowers is unfair, unnecessary and bad monetarism. Inflation is mainly caused by sellers, not buyers, and attempts should also be made to stop sellers increasing prices. Interest rate rises   cause many problems such as greater inflation, higher wage rises and difficulties for young families. It is bad monetarism, as it increases some spending:- it takes money from some people who have to increase borrowing to pay bills, and it also gives other people money they will spend or send abroad. Mortgage increases above RPI could be replaced by a tax on new borrowing, either one-off or tapering off when inflation falls, or a corset on bank lending as used before Thatcher. Inflation should also be tackled by punishing and incentivising businesses who raise prices rather than punishing consumers. It is consumers who need protection from higher prices- which is recognised by legislation on labelling, trading standards and monopolies.",
