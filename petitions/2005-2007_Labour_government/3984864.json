            "background": "Taxes on CO2 are allegedly to help reduce damage to the environment, in particular global warming, yet scientific evidence is to the contrary. The increase in CO2 follows temperature change but is 800 years BEHIND - therefore cannot be the cause of global warming. Volcanoes and decaying leaves from trees in Autumn produce more CO2 than every man made source put together. Taxation on emission of these gasses (which are essential to life as we know it) should be abolished as they clearly serve to simply pacify green lobbyists and fill the tax gaps left by a general reduction in the usual tax cash cows such as cigarettes.",
