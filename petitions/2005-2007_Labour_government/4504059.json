            "background": "Build cycle routes placed in elevated tubes. Although it would not be a comprehensive network and would complement in certain locations, rather than replace on-road cycling, the system would make it possible to cycle through Britain's cities avoiding major traffic routes. This would encourage more people to cycle thus reducing pollution and congestion. The system would have major advantages over ground based segregated\n cycle routes: \n1. There would be no danger from motorised traffic at junctions. \n2. They wouldn't have to stop at every\nside road and junction like pavement based cycle routes. \n3. They would protect cyclists from wind and rain.\n 4. They could be placed where there is insufficient road space for a ground\nroute. \n5. In hilly areas, the tubes could smooth out contours in the terrain. Lifts could be provided if needed in order to reach the tubes from street level.\n6. It would make British cities look futuristic.\n\nI believe that although it sounds radical, this policy may be at least as cost-effective as other means of absorbing the travel demand transferred from cars if government policy for doing this is successful. The DoT should at least do a feasibility study.",
