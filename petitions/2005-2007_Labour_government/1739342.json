            "background": "Removal of vehicle car tax and add cost to fuel. Calculations on an average car doing 15000 miles per year and attaining 30 mpg with a road tax of \u00a3140/ year would roughly equate to 5p per litre of fuel. This way those doing excessive mileages or using uneconomical vehicles would pay the price for road usage, economical drivers would benefit. Vehicles with a reduced \"tax\" rate, buses, historic vehicles, etc could claim back the fuel duty paid based on mileage covered between M.O.T inspections. This would also allow for an \"MOT Disc\" to be issued in the place of a tax disc giving instant recognition of unroadworthy vehicles.",
