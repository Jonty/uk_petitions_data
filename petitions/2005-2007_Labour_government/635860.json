They are allowed to pass a LGV test at a fraction of the cost and to a very very low standard to the UK LGV test, then are allowed to come here and drive on our roads. This is cleary not acceptable. \nIn France they do not allow this. You have to pass a test and hold the appropriate licence.\nWe need to address this as too many accidents involving people from other eu states. \nWe as a country do not want to be part of europe.",
