            "background": "We feel strongly that the current voting system does not correctly deal with the right of the voter to show that they are unhappy with the choice of candidates at local and parliamentary elections and would like to see the addition of the option abstain to all ballot papers. This would allow for a better consistent way for voters to show their unhappiness at the options rather than the current system were they either do not vote and it counts as voter apathy or spoil the paper in some way so counts a spoilt vote.",
