            "background": "I do not have a problem with teaching the idea of creationism in schools as such but the younger generations should at least be given the chance to do it or not forced into the concept of religion.  Public schools teaching religious and non-religious students; should not teach religious and ethical guidings, many people supporting a religion would not want to hear about science at church. \nThere are separate places for religion and science, church and public schools respectively. \nI believe that if you are an atheist, like myself you should not be forced to adhere to something in which you don't believe anyway. If you choose to do religious studies as a core part of your GCSE regime thats up to the individual, the religious studies short course concept (which only values 1/2 a GCSE anyway!) should be rethought, rather than being compulsory.\n\nResources:\nThe Simpsons 17x21 \"The Monkey Suit\"\n\n\"I respect your beliefs and I can see how deeply you feel about them. I just don't think religion should be taught in schools, anymore than you'd want scientists teaching at the church\"",
