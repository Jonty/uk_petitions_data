Instead of wasting vast amounts of time, money and energy looking into how Britain can save the planet (when we only produce 2% of the worlds greenhouse gasses) and rushing to upgrade our nuclear arsenal (at a potential cost of \u00a370bn). Our politicians should instead be working harder to.... 1) Get our children into decent schools. 2) Get the NHS back on track. 3) Sort out the lack of prison spaces. 4) Provide our soldiers with essential equipment and pull out from Iraq. 5) Get a grip on the rapidly growing gun culture of todays youth",
