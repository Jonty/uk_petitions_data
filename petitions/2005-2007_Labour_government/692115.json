            "background": "For the government to institute a system whereby restitution is made to the victims of crime by their perpetrators, equal to the losses suffered, whether due to theft, property-destruction, or a wage-earner\u2019s death.\n\nThe victim would be paid immediately from a central fund which would be reimbursed from the perpetrator\u2019s \u201cloan\u201d account maintained by the Inland Revenue. The account would be created for a first offence and have it\u2019s balance increased for further offences.\n\nThe Inland Revenue would enforce payment by deduction from the perpetrator's salary, already having in place the necessary mechanisms.\n\nIf the perpetrator was a minor, or unemployed person, the debt would remain until it can be made. Minor offenders would therefore enter their working life with a debt to be paid (a powerful deterrent).\n\nIf necessary a perpetrator's assets would be seized to make good the payment. If still unpaid at the time of death the balance would be taken from the perpetrator's estate.",
