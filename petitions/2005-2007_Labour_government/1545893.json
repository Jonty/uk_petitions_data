            "background": "The existence of a potential but difficult to ascertain liability to pay thousands of pounds to maintain parts of local churches  has given rise to significant costs to housebuyers, in checking liability and insuring against it. Some properties are entirely blighted. We call upon the PM to promote legislation to abolish this liability or to provide for its easy redemption on terms which are fair. Currently the arrangements for redemption are unworkable and assume that each landowner in an affected area (such as a third of Brighton) is wholly responsible.",
