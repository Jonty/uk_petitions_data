She was an amazing women that helped open up so many peoples eyes to the problems that go on all around us. Just imagine what good could have been achieved if she was still here touching our hearts today.\n\nNow the only way I can see this happening is to stop the cause of it... money. If the photographer can't make a profit from sleeping outside a frightened young women\u2019s house till she goes out, then why do it?? Then if the papers/magazines/TV channels aren't allowed to buy them to increase sales, then why buy them?\nNow I don't mind what the law be called but I would like to see it instated before the anniversary of Diana's death, as I feel it would be fitting to know that we won't potentially lose another great humanitarian that could do so much good for this world just because some photographer pushed them over the edge of reason or caused another tragic accident.",
