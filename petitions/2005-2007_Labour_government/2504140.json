            "background": "There are thousands may be more of women in their seventies and eighties who through having to raise a family by remaining at home for many years are treated unfairly in not being given the basic state pension.Instead they are awarded an amount based on their husbands pension,which in many cases amounts to around \u00a350pw.This is a total injustice to these women who in todays circumstances of support to todays mothers would probably receive twice that amount.Please support this petition and reward those that have put others first as most mothers do.Of course if the Chancellor holds out long enough a wreath would suffice.",
