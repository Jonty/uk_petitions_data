The designer must be laughing all the way to the bank.\n\nEpilepsy Action said it had received reports of 22 people having fits while watching the video, with reports of others vomiting and having migraines.\n\nOn top of that the logo looks like something a cat threw up. How many other people had to stare at it for 20 seconds before they even the noticed the '2012'?\n\nThe logo looks like a tag you would find graffiti-ed onto a cable box.\n\nThe Olympics is costing over 9 BILLION POUND already. Surely a big competition with a 10k prize and a text vote would have generated income and good will?\n\nDisgraceful! We want to change it!",
