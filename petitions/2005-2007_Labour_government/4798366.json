Theft of horses, horseboxes and expensive equipment is rife, and the police forces aren't even trying to detect. I was told by my local force when I was a victim that 'thats what insurance companies are for'! I think not. This is a massive crime wave, and no wonder that it is proliferating when there is zero chance of perpertrators being detected because there are zero attempts to detect! Even the equestrian magazines are setting up websites to help - and the police are doing NOTHING!!! Lets see some action!",
