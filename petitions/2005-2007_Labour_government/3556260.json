            "background": "There are many prisoners in mainstream prisons who have learning disabilities. Often they will have been involved with adult services prior to committing offences, and will have had community care assessments and care plans outlining their levels of support needs. However these documents dont appear to be taken into consideration by prison officials, and too often this vulnerable group will not be given the additional support they have been assessed as needing.A specialist 'prison' could take into account the support needs and employ staff who are able to provide the level of care required.",
