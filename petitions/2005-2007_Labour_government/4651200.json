            "background": "Most recreational drugs have problems associated with them whether addiction or physiological .\nAdults should be allowed to do as they wish .\nI propose that no drug should be banned and should be on open sale possibly in a 'pharmacy' . These drugs should be taxed and a minimum of 50% of this money should be channelled into an unbiased education as to the effects of that particular drug [good and bad]. \nHopefully , this would cut both cut down on the use of most drugs as the person would be informed about what he/she was proposing to do , and if they still wished to do that , what right has a government to ban its citizens from doing what they wished [ and where it's not harming others] .\nIt would also reduce organised crime , increase the govenrments' revenues and also stop people being pressured into taking harder drugs",
