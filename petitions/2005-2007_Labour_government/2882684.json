            "background": "We urge the government and education department to recognise the importance of correct spelling, grammar and punctuation in later life, and to reintroduce such lessons and regular testing into schools from an early age. Extra tuition should be provided for those children who appear to be weaker in these areas. Once in the adult world, \"personal interpretations\" of spelling and the like are unacceptable, and will not assist them when attempting to enter the workplace. We need to go back to producing young adults who can speak and write effectively and correctly in English, whatever their native tongue.",
