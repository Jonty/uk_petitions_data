        "background": "It is simplistic, but true, that all the intractable problems both at home and abroad - famine, lack of security, inadequate education, over-expensive housing, traffic congestion and pressure on resources, to name a mere few - can be attributed in substance to the over-population by humans of the world as a whole, and of this country.\n\nIt is not sufficient merely to reduce growth. Absolute numbers will have to be reduced, if still possible, in an orderly way and there is some evidence that the long-term total should not exceed 3 billion, which is half the present number.\n\nThe earth as a planet is quite indifferent as to whether humans exist or not. Species evolve, species go extinct. The longer the present situation persists the greater will be the catastrophe, in human terms.",
