            "background": "At present local authorities are able to force the sale of a person's home to fund their care, usually in old age. Most homeowners have worked all their lives to purchase a home for themselves and which they would like to leave as a legacy to their children. They have paid all their taxes, interest on mortgages, value added tax on purchases and even tax on their pensions. When a person tries to be a responsible citizen and support themselves, asking for little from the system throughout their lives, they should not be penalised in this way when they are unable to care for themselves. They should be allowed to pass on their home to their children as a legacy.",
