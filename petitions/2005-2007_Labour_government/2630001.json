            "background": "It should be agreed that everyone in the country should be given the same rights. However, insidious revisions to our everyday language via the media have demolished ages old beliefs so quickly that political correctness has become part of our lives without the general public even being aware of it, or even being consulted about it. \n\nIt could be a trap just to shut right minded debates on religion, sexuality etc. We have come too far in trying not to offend the minority, which although praiseworthy, is now affecting the lives of the majority. Surely common sense and not government edicts should rule how we behave to others. If taken to the extreme it will stifle honest debate.",
