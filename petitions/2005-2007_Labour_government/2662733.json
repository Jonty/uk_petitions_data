There is no proof that this will help the environment, if it succeeds at cutting passengers it will be at the cost of UK Jobs. Road traffic produces 18% of CO2 emissions as opposed to aviation at 2% of CO2 emissions. It is not only the public that will suffer but also the thousands of jobs in the aviation industry and associated companies; British tourism will also be damaged by these taxes that will deter visitors coming to London and the UK",
