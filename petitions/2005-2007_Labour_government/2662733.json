        "background": "A Family of 4 will now pay \u00a380 extra (long haul) and \u00a340 (short haul). While business will be paying up to \u00a340 extra (\u00a380 total) just for one person. There is no proof that this will help the environment, if it succeeds at cutting passengers it will be at the cost of UK Jobs. Road traffic produces 18% of CO2 emissions as opposed to aviation at 2% of CO2 emissions. It is not only the public that will suffer but also the thousands of jobs in the aviation industry and associated companies; British tourism will also be damaged by these taxes that will deter visitors coming to London and the UK",
