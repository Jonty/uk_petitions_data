It should be more accurately described as Buy One Get One You Don't Need! Furthermore it discriminates against single person and old people households; where the ability to consume/store the increased quantities is diminished. BOGOFs are already illegal in certain areas of the continent where the equivalent sales tool is a straight forward price reduction.",
