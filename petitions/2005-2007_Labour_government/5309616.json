            "background": "I urge our people to rid ourselves from international banking, protection of israel and abolish corporate greed for oil.  I ask our people has the war\nbeen justified, and i declare our democracy as corrupt.  I urge that we should make all partys and politicians accountable, who justified the bloodshed of innocents to be held accountable, and our collaboration to the american administration void.  Its time we as a people had a reason to be happy with ourselves, its time we was peaceful and not addicted to oil,greed and protection of banking interests worldwide.  People are dieing of war, hunger, poverty, and disease and global disasters.  Which the west alone has played a part in for atleast a century.",
