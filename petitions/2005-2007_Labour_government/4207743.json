        "background": "Have you ever been choked by a car, van, lorry or bus whose exhaust fumes were billowing out the back of it? Yes? We all have, however local authorities are only interested in commercial vehicles and not private cars or small to large vans (only trucks are classed as commercial). In California you can call and report these dirty polluters but here you can do nothing! We want either a central actionline or a local actionline who will take action against these people and not wait for their annual MOT. By the it is too late.",
