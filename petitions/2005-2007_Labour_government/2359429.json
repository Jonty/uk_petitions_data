        "action": "Review the provision of post-16 education and to broaden the scope of vocational education where it is suited, reducing the number of people attending university and increasing the amount of skilled trade labour in the country.  As a result of the reduction in university numbers, scrap tuition fees and introduce appropriate non-means testing funding",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The number of young adults entering University is unsustainable with many getting into debt and undertaking degrees with minimal added value. British industry is calling out for skilled workers however the lack of any sort of apprenticeship scheme is evident. Therefore post-16 education should be reviewed as a whole, taking onboard recommendations of the Tomlinson Report, with a view of reducing and not funding degrees with minimal added value and providing more funding for value adding degrees by scrapping tuition fees and providing appropriate non means tested funding for students. More funding for vocational education should be provided both directly to teaching providers and to potential employers to meet the country's future requirements for skilled labour. Employers should be engaged to determine the types of degrees and vocational courses which should be supported as they will result in high-calibre graduates who will be of beneficial value to the employment market.",
