            "background": "The British are known throughout the world as being excessive drinkers.  Many people are unable to dance or socialise until they have lost themselves in an alcohol or drug haze.\nI propose special days in existing commercial venues as well as community centres and schools with dances and social activities.\nIn addition such venues could provide only tasty healthy food, juices and smoothies to provide the energy that people need for such activities. The atmosphere, where participants can appreciate the fun, the music, the company and the activity, will appeal to health-minded individuals and those who wish to avoid the disadvantages of binge drinking and hangovers and low energy levels.\nA new generation could arise that would live and enjoy every hour of every day free from the excesses and violence associated with much entertainment.",
