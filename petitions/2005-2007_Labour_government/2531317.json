            "background": "Welsh properties were rebanded in 2004. Now State Pensioners living in Wales who rely on the State Pension after tax are disadvantage financially. The State Pension for Welsh Pensioners has been plundered through re-banding, whilst English State Pensioners have escaped this burden. In 2004-05 a property in Band F had rates payable of \u00a31217.57\nby 2006-07 the same property had rates payable of \u00a31819.45 after taking into account Welsh Assembly Transitional arrangements & arrangements for Pensioners.  An increase of \u00a3601.88 a year does not relate to the increase in State Pensions across the UK.\nThis inequality between UK citizens, whereby English State Pensioners make a smaller contribution from their pensions to local services than State Pensioners in Wales, is undemocratic & an abuse of senior citizens democratic rights for equal treatment by the State.",
