            "background": "We ask your government Sir, urgently, to reform taxation by simplifying and reducing the number of complex laws and regulations. We acknowledge it is our responsibility to pay our taxes, but: not a penny more, nor less than is due. Conversely it is incumbent upon The Government to ensure that we - The Citizens - are able to understand simply, the taxation laws, without requiring recourse to specialist taxation experts. We believe that you must implement this necessary change as soon as possible, because it is a Basic Human And Democratic Right.",
