In particularly, restrict the sale of 4x4 and other off road vehicals to those within the agriculture sector, and others who can reasonably justify the use of these vehicals such as those living in the Scottish highlands.\n\nThis ruling would not only be beneficial for the environment, but also for the safety of other motorists, and the general well being of our health.\n\nEvidence suggests clearly that these vehicals cause excessive damage to victims in road accidents compared to 'normal' vehicals, and the engine sizes required to maintain these vehicals are potentially causing severe damage to the environment. This in turn, is contributing to global warming and to the severity of health conditions such as asthma.",
