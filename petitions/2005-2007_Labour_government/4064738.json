There seems to be a misunderstanding of the situation is Sri Lanka, viz., that the Tamils are terrorists. All they asked for is a right of self-determination, and fundamental human rights which is the basic right of every human being, irrespective of colour, caste, or community. The present situation was not envisaged when Lord Soullbury drafted the constitution drawn by him when Sri Lanka was granted independence. Since writing this the situation has worsened in Sri Lanka, which is not different from the treatment given by Serbians to Albanians during Milosovitch's regime, which the Prime Minister had taken upon himself to pursuade the EU to take action against the regime.",
