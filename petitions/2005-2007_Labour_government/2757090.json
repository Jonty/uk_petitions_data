The programs should instill Life Skills, Work experience, Discipline but most importantly ambition into the youth of today. This system should replace the excessive use of ASBO\u2019s or youth prisons, and work in a similar way to the current community service system already in place for adults.\n \n(Discipline, Respect, Motivation and Understanding)",
