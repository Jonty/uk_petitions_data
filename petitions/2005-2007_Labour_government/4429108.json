Parents and teachers have NO respect from kids of today, when i was a lad in the 1980s i would have NEVER have dis-respected my parents and teachers,swearing was never in front of our parents or teachers, kids now do this  freely because they know they wont get punished.

Respect of fellow humanbeings starts when you are young,so lets do something about it... GIVE US BACK THE RIGHT TO PUNISH OUR KIDS !",
