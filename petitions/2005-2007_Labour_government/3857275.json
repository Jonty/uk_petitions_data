            "background": "I propose the re-introduction of a Poll Tax to replace Council Tax.\n\nCouncil Tax is inherently unfair. A level of tax, determined by the size of the property irrespective of the number of occupants, is totally illogical.\n\nIf the purpose of Council Tax is to fund local services then all users of the services should pay.\n\nAt present properties housing extended families with several adults and children pay the same as an elderly couple living on their own. Single occupants only receive an illogical 25% reduction, rather than 50%\n\nA Poll tax is absolutely fair. To be paid by all persons over 18 years to the council in which they are reside.\n\nPoll Tax paid monthly by all adults would provide a greater income stream for the Councils and would reduce the overall taxation on any one individual. No means testing, no exemptions, no adjustment based on ability to pay \u2013 everyone pays the same.\n\nCheap to collect, easy to administer, no involvement of the Valuation Office Agency with regard to private residences.",
