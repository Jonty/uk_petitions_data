Attacks on voters were rife. Over 200 deaths occurred during this vote. Goodness knows how the votes were actually counted. The Nigerian election hardly smacks of legitimacy. It is for Number 10 to denounce this rigged election and call for another one to be held under democratic, safe conditions.",
