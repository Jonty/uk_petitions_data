LP failed to carry out its drastic plans to reduce the number of faciltators but,  Nevertheless, the C-SOGP unit is under performing due to a chronic lack of funding.  If the Public knew that the very offenders they are most fearful of are waiting up to a year to get on a programme, then there would of course be a national outcry.  More resources should be put into this important work, which is what the public would require.\nPeter Stewart",
