        "background": "Since April 2nd the Government has moved the 'Goalposts' for non EEC nationals by insisting they have to take the 'Life in the UK' test which requires a Esol level 3 standard. This is grossly unfair to spouses and their British partners who were never aware of this new rule when they began the long journey to settlement.  It is also discriminatory because EEC nationals are not required to have this level of English qualifcation, in order to remain.Now we have another item to add to the list of MIS-SOLD Pensions,and Insurance. SETTLEMENT VISAS!from the UK government.",
