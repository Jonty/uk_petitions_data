            "background": "Equality is equality \u2013 no group should suppress the other - we should support the rights of both equally. A compromise can work if the Catholic adoption workers become part of wider organisations. Therefore whenever gay couples approach the organisation Catholics will not be the ones to deal with them but the wider organisation can freely accept their applications just like any other couple.\n\nThe difference between this way forward and the current Catholic method of referring  gay couples is that the Catholics could offset the non-Gay applications within the organisation (so together the organisation can deal with more couples) and therefore there is no organisational-wide discrimination going on - merely the upholding of the individual worker's values.\n\nIt is similar to going into a hotel and the receptionist being unable to deal with the individuals. What is important is that person gets an equally good room in the hotel, and isn't merely referred to another place of accommodation.",
