        "background": "I appeal to all who read to sign.  If your partner dies prematurely the financial burden can be as devastating. Indeed the LOSS of all or a huge part of your income.  The DWP operate a benefit named WIDOWED PARENT ALLOWANCE.  Dependant on you age, this benefit is specific to widows/widowers with school age children, you get the benefit for 12 months--age 42 or less at the time of bereavement.  If you are over 42 you receive the benefit until your children leave school age 16.  People under 42 are the ones likely to have children who are of school age and therefore the most deserving of assitance long term.  The benefit is an anathema probably written by some one who has no experience of bereavement.  Also the young widowed community is a minority most vulnerable group where aprox 50000 a year lose a husband/wife/partner. The age barrier is unfair and discriminatory.  Vote here to support change.",
