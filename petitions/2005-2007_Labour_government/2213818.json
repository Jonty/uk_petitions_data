            "background": "With its new policy of dumbing down, trying to attract a younger audience and serve minorities BBC Local Radio is alienating the mainstream majority of listeners with a pursuit of PC broadcasting.\nThe pursuit of this policy has led to the housebound, elderly and blind no longer being able to recieve the light entertainment and conversation in the evenings, which to some is a lifeline.\nAn example can be seen with BBC 3 Counties Radio which has cancelled all of its popular evening schedules and replaced it with Ethnic programming every night, all night seven days a week.\nThis is despite the BBC already having dedicated asian afro carribean stations.",
