            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current system of charging by emmissions only applies to cars manufactured after 01.03.2001 which means a 1.0L car registered before this date (which may only be driven a few miles per week) still pays the same rate of road tax as a brand new 3.5L Jaguar or 4.0L Jeep.\n\nBy changing the charge to an amount per 100cc, say \u00a310, the 1.0L will pay \u00a3100 per annum & the 4.0L Jeep \u00a3400 irespective of the age of the car. \n\nEmmissions would still be part of the MOT, so those cars whose emmissions are too high would still be removed from the road and high mileage drivers will still pay more tax depending on the amount of fuel used.",
