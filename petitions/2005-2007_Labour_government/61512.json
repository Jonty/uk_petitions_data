            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The travel industry offers fragmented and varied forms of carbon offsetting schemes to help against its inherent role in climate change. We know from our experience of enabling customers to make their car hire carbon neutral at source that too few customers know, appreciate, or trust the step they can take to help reduce their carbon footprint. We want unified standards in the travel sector to recognise and promote this practical and accessible method for \u2018going green\u2019 when travelling.\n\nPlease support this e-petition so the Government back the industry standard to help awareness, to encourage acceptance, and to realise latent demand for green travel. Central approval of the standard for carbon neutral offsetting is the required impetus in making travel customers go green, and is an important element in overall climate control following the Stern Report.",
