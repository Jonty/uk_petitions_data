            "background": "One of the greatest obstacles to 100% literacy is the obsolete state of English spelling. Many of the so-called 'difficult words' have utterly arbitrary spellings, often with no etymological basis: for example there is no historical need for the 'l' in 'could', or the 's' in 'island'; and why does 'deceit' have a simpler spelling than 'receipt'? Languages which use a more logical spelling have much lower levels of illiteracy. English is one of the few world languages not to have updated its spelling in the last 400 years. English is easy to speak, but deliberately to keep it difficult to read and write is a perplexing stance for a world nation.",
