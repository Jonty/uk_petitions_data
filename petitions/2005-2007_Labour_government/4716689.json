        "background": "The existence of public schools only furthers the idea that a good education is a priveledge of the wealthy.  Public schooling is a luxury reserved for those born into rich families and the idea that a person should have better prospects based on their birth belongs more in the fuedal system than in modern day Britain.  Should a wealthy family wish to improve the education of their children they would still be able to donate to state schools, such a system would improve schooling for all children rather than the select few.",
