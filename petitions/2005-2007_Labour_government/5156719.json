            "background": "demonise: portray as evil.\n      \nIsrael is repeatedly demonised \u2026 by MPs, media & UK groups (trade unions, academia, medical bodies, journalist groups - even architects \u2013 seeking boycotts).\nIt\u2019s ok to criticize, but singling out & applying unique standards turns demonic. \nThe deafening silence of those outspoken on Israel on \u2018similar issues\u2019 shows more than criticism. e.g. boycotts groups don\u2019t fault countries with far worse human rights records than Israel could be accused of. They cite occupation\u2013 yet don\u2019t consider acting against other occupiers e.g. Britain. \nDemonisation warps the conflict, is an obstacle to peace, refutes UK reputation of moral fairness, serves those who justify terror & does nothing to halt increasing anti-Semitism. \nBlair put Israel in group of \u2018others\u2019 after 7/7: \u201cattack was carried out by Islamic terrorists responsible for many deaths in Madrid, Bali, S. Arabia, Russia, Kenya, Tanzania, Pakistan, Yemen, Turkey, Egypt & Morocco and, of course NY but in many other countries too\u2026\u201d \nOmitting Israel was a moral travesty, rewriting history, insulting to terror victims & rewarding those who demonize Israel.",
