Whilst victims' groups consider this is acceptable, Penal Reform organisations outnumber victims organisations 100-1.\nFor every \u00a328,000 spent anually on each prisoner's welfare, safety, rehabilitation, legal aid and quality of life, only \u00a318.66 is spent on each victim.\nPenal Reform organisations have been established since 1876.  Conversely, the first victims' organisation emerged 100 years later, in 1976, and later victim-led organisations emerged during the 1990's.\nCriminology is a well researched, funded and academic subject, whereas victimology is almost considered to be a 'brand new science';largely ignored as less significant by society as criminology.",
