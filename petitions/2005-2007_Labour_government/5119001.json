        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "If all benefits were scrapped(including the Old Age Pension) and instead every citizen was given a flat payment of (say) \u00a3100 per week for adults and \u00a350 for under 18's (payable to their parents)this would revolutionise the Welfare State. It would give incentive to work as everything you earn is extra, incentive to save for retirement, instead of the perverse situation were people who have saved for a small pension are no better off because of the loss of Pension Credits.\nIt would save billions on administration and benefit fraud and stop the perceived injustices many feel about people going to work being little or no better off than those who don't. But it would still provide a safety net for the people who genuinely can't work and the retired.",
