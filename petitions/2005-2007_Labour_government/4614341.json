Pay for a beat officer is between \u00a320,000 and \u00a330,000.\n\nEstimating that one more member of the police force on the beat prevents two crimes a year, which would have resulted in a jail term, then a very substantial saving to the exchequer would be the outcome.\n\nIt is clear that in order to reduce crime and prison populations we need to invest more in our police force.\n\nCrime prevention is very much better than cure.",
