            "background": "The practice of placing various items of fruit upon train tickets has become more common in the past year or so. What was once a spate of isolated incidents has quickly snowballed into a potential problem. \n\nThe act of placing an item of fruit upon a ticket causes a spread of juice, tarnishing the ticket and - in worst case scenarios - washing off the print so the ticket is unreadable and thus unuseable. When broached with this problem, railway staff may oftentimes be inclined not to believe the victim, resulting in a hefty fine. This creates further potential problems for the lower-earning contingent of the demographic, as - depending on the extent of the fine - they may not be able to pay and thus potentially land up behind bars for an indeterminate amount of time. All because of a misplaced piece of fruit.",
