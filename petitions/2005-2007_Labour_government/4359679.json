        "background": "Given that new drivers are involved in a large proportion of accidents while their skills are still developing, I feel it would be wise to introduce a limitation in the power output of the vehicles they are allowed to drive for a 2 year period having passed their driving test. This would also bring them into line with new motorcyclists where the policy has had a beneficial effect.",
