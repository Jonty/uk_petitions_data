        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The A48 between it's junction with the A40 and Chepstow is used as a 'Rat Run' by trucks wishing to avoid Severn Bridge tolls.  These trucks often get wedged under railway bridges causing significant disruption to local road and rail traffic, they also travel at speeds well in excess of the speed limit with no visible policing.  The safety of those who live on this route is put at risk daily and the quality of life severly compromised.  Many schools on this route have a speed limit of 50mph within metres of their playgrounds.\n\nWe would like the PM to introduce legislation making it mandatory for 20mph speed limits near schools and 30mph for all villages whether they be linear or otherwise.  We would also like legislation to allow suitably trained people to use speed detection equipment and issue enforceable penalties.",
