            "background": "The impending smoking ban is being implemented without any thought for the \nwider effects on employment,the right of people to enjoy their hard earned leisure time and no consultation with \nthe 14 million people who still smoke.\nI can accept the rights of non smokers\nnot to have to be exposed to passive smoke,but the blanket ban is not a balanced or thought through approach.\nAs a result of this ban, many thousands\nof jobs (including my own) will be lost\nand  many leisure establishments including pubs, clubs, casinos and bingo halls to name a few will be forced to close reducing our freedom to spend our leisure time as we wish.\nI really cannot understand why smoking is so demonized, when drinking,with\nuse of the police resources and social problems it causes appears to be activly encouraged.By all means protect the non smokers in but in democratic country ,all sections have a vote and should have the right to be consulted before such draconian measures are introduced.",
