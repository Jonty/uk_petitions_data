            "background": "With road charging, congestion charging, toll roads, road tax, petrol tax, VAT on buying vehicles, How are the British public expected to earn a living, supporting their family?  All these taxes are increasing much faster than the rate of inflation and therefore are making British citizens poorer as they are increasingly priced out of living comfortably in Britain.\n\nAll this tax on cars and then the latest news that South West Trains has increased its fares by 20% during mid morning.  How are we supposed to travel, our income does not increase by 20% a year or increase enough to even cover a \u00a3200 increase in road tax.\n\nTherefore i petition the Prime Minister to scrap plans to double road tax for larger cars",
