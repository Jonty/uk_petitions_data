            "background": "Carers over 60 years of age, not in receipt of benefits but drawing the Old Age Pension are penalised by having the Carer's Allowance stopped.  We continue this work well beyond our own retirement age. Many worked in industry before taking on this dedicated role, and paid tax and national insurance. Many live on the basic Pension, some just above the line of poverty.  We have great difficulties in caring for our loved ones, both physical and financial.   We are an unseen army of Britain.    Most would not be recognised in the street, but the Government is very aware of our work.  We save them \u00a358 billion each year.  The reason for not paying CA to OAP Carers, is that we are not entitled to 2 benefits at the same time. CA is NOT a benefit, but a miniscule amount each week that can make such an enormous difference to our lives.\nPlease Mr. Blair, recognise us for the great work we do and reinstate the Carer's Allowance to the over 60's Carers of this country.",
