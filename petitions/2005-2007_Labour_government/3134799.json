            "background": "The proposed method of valuing homes for the council tax is unacceptable. It is the honest, hard working, sensible homeowner who is punished for living a decent and well ordered life. The homeowner who invest their hard earned money into their home, will now be penalised for doing the right thing. What incentive is there now for anyone to be hard working and law abiding, to be a good neighbour and keep their garden in good order, to be considerate and not make excessive noise, to be tidy and improve the carbon foot print of their property. Home valuation should be based on the market value of the property not the lifestyle choices of the homeowners who care for and improve their home.",
