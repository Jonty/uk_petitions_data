            "background": "Wind turbines will decimate many thousands of migratory birds, from small passerines to large raptors. Many hundreds of Warblers as well as Thrushes, Pipits, birds of prey, seabirds and many others of all sizes, incuding frequent rarities cross to england from Siberia and Asia during the Autumn on reverse migration, arriving tired and exhausted on the East Anglian and Kent coast to feed up and move on. To be cut out of the sky by the huge blades of a turbine would create the opposite off all conservationists are striving hard for. ie: extinction of some if not all species that migrate!",
