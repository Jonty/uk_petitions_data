            "background": "Too many young people are killed on the roads because as soon as they have passed their test they can drive a car of unlimited power. The government should introduce a similar system to that currently used for motorcycle riders where the size of engine for young drivers would be restricted until they reach 25 years old. Vehicles should also be required to have speed limiters fitted restricting the maximum speed to 50MPH until the driver is 25 years old.",
