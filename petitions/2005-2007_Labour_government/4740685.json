            "background": "I, as many others do in todays flexible working environment, work at 2 different workplaces in order to earn something approaching a living wage. However my wage from my second job is taxed at a much higher rate, even though i still earn less than \u00a3200 per week when my wage is combined.\nTherefore I wish that this be changed so that you are taxed only on your overall income at the correct rate as I believe it is unfair to tax low earners at the basic rate just because one employer can't give them a decent wage.",
