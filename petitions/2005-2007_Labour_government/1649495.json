            "background": "To deter anti social behaviour and bullying in schools fixed penalty notices could be issued. \nSocially acceptable behaviour is learnt at an early age through parenting and in school. There is little deterrant for badly behaved children at school, some children are rewarded for bad behaviour through scheme's where they have to behave for a couple of months and then are taken Go Karting or to the Cinema. \nOccasionally parents are asked to come into schools to discuss their childs behaviour. Then for a couple of weeks or months only the child will behave appropriately.\nWhat chance do these children have as adults when they do not know how to behave, what chance does society have also!\nFixed penalty notices are given to parents whose children are frequently truant, why not include bullying and anti social behaviour also.",
