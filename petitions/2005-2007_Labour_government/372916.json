However,there are a few things that those who have come to our country need to understand.This idea of England being a multicultural community has served only to dilute our sovereignty and our national identity.Therefore,if you wish to become part of our society, learn the language!We are happy with our culture and have no desire to change.This is Britain and we will allow you every opportunity to enjoy this.Once you are done complaining about our Flag,Our Pledge,Our National Motto,or Our Way of Life,I highly encourage you take advantage of one other great British freedom,\"THE RIGHT TO LEAVE\".If you aren't happy here then leave.We didn't force you to come here.You asked to be here.So accept the country YOU accepted.",
