        "background": "We all know that many people find the current national anthem boring and want alternatives. I can't think of any song that sums up Britain as much as \"God save the Queen\" by the Sex Pistols. It's vibrant, it's exciting, and these are the things that make Britain British, not some sordid old boring song composed centuries ago.",
