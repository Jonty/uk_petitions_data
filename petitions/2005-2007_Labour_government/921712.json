            "background": "Recent news that the Information Commissioner's Office have declared it is too late to outlaw fingerprinting technologies in our nation's schools due to the number of schools currently using such technologies, is a very worrying situation.\n\nNot only do such methods breach the human rights and civil liberties of our children, but they lead way in changing the mindset's of our future leaders to make civilian surveilance an acceptable norm.\n\nThe UK was recently listed as one of the most heavily monitored countries in the world with regards to civil surveilance.\n\nWe need to stop these technologies from encroaching on our rights and we need to protect our children from the draconian dissolution of their civil liberties.",
