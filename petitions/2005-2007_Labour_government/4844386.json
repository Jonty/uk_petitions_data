        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Stop increasing the cost of running a car by such inflationary percentages, under the false guise of encouring us all to go green. If everyone bought new cars which are \"greener\" the impact on global warming would be astronomic in terms of raw materials being used in production, and the very cost of running the machinery used. Additionally since car production has been sent overseas by the short sightedness of this government, our own economy suffers too, killing off local garages employing local people.",
