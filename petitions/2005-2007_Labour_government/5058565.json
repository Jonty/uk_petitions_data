            "background": "This art project is to cost an indecent amount of money (\u00a318 m) and was very poorly advertised in giving people the chance to object. The majority of people on Deeside do not want this hideous 'art' to be built in our area- at least those that knew about it. We have several long standing icons to welcome visitors to Wales; such as the Blue River Dee Bridge which was constructed at the beginning of the last century and is very well loved. Please don't spoil our area??!! We are already having to contend with the so called improvements to the motorway system which is destroying our countryside!!",
