It would appear from recent, highly publicised petitions (road tax revisions, the Navy '15' held in Iraq and the selling of their story) that the Prime Minister does not listen to the public signing these petitions and making their feelings known.  Instead, the government chooses to ignore public feeling and issue a statement on the situation as a fet a complit.  If the government chooses to so brazenly ignore public feeling, close the website and stop fooling your voting public that you can listen.",
