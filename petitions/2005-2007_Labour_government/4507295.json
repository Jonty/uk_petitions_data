        "background": "Recently a reply was given to thousands of people saying Bob Paisley would not be awarded a knighthood as 'a knighthood is an honour only given during someone's lifetime.' Therefore a new type of honour should be formed to celebrate the achievements of deceased heroes who never got the recognition they deserved. Therefore start a petition calling for a new honour to be made one which allows for posthumous appointments. The first name on the list should indeed be Bob Paisley followed by other 'high-achieving sports figures as well as authors, scientists and others who were not knighted during their lifetimes; Charles Darwin, Captain Cook, RJ Mitchell, who created the Spitfire, John Lennon and even William Shakespeare.'",
