We stand together against knee-jerk reactions to tragic recent events.\n\nWe oppose against Breed Specific Legislation (BSL) and Amnesties  because we feel, since the inception of the DDA in 1991, it has been proven that BSL simply does not work.\n\nIf irresponsibly raised, trained and supervised, any dog - from pekinese to poodle to pit bull - is capable of causing harm. If any dog is truly dangerous, it's every owner who should bear sole responsible for the consequences of their lack of care. It's time to look to the other end of the lead.",
