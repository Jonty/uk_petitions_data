Kemble is one of The UK\u2019s finest airfields and as well as providing a great deal of pleasure for pilots and aviation enthusiasts also provides local employment opportunities and flying training. \n\nThe site has been an aerodrome for almost 70 years, and enjoys the support of 85% of the local community (according to Kemble & Ewen Parish Council survey 2006) thanks in part to its careful noise abatement procedures. The loss of such a facility would be a tragic blow for the General Aviation community in the UK.",
