        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As a frequent traveller I find that the standard UK passport soon becomes worn and damaged.  In most EU countries Photo ID is mandatory and within the Schengen area I have always had my DVLC licence accepted as adequate ID.\nTo obtain my DVLC photo licence I had to provide my passport as ID, therefore the system knows I have a valid UK passport. It also knows my driving history of many years.\nThe licence has my photo, twice. It has my place and date of birth clearly shown.\nAdditional to the information on my passport it shows my current UK address.\nAny police officer can confirm the validity of my licence in seconds from a patrol vehicle, if so minded immigration officials could do the same.\nIt might be argued that the passport is  machine readable and the DVLC licence is not, however we happily accept community ID cards which we cannot verify and are bound to do so by treaty. \nUntil and if UK issues ID cards this measure would simplify the need to carry a bulky and fragile document around whilst travelling and place UK citizens on a more equal footing for inter EU travel to that enjoyed by our fellow European citizens.",
