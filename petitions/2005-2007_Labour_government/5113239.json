            "background": "The North Circular (a406) is always congested mainly for a few reasons which could be easily solved. There are areas where the A406 narrows to one lane and others where traffic lights are in place for cross junctions causing massive cues to get through the lights on both sides. I purpose the Government starts investing in the roads and build under-passes in these effective areas to keep the north circular three lanes and fifty miles p/h limit to keep the traffic flowing smoothly.",
