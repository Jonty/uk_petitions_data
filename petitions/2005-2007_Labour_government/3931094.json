            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Anyone working full time should be entitled to own their own home. Demand outstrips supply especially in the South East.  This is due to mass immigration and also persons owning more than one residency, either as an investment, or for personal use.  This inflates house prices and denies huge numbers of Britain's the chance to own a home, also causing business problems in recruiting skilled labour.  It is morally wrong.  Stamp duty changes will mitigate this and open up the market to many more people.",
