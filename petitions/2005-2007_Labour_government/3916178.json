            "background": "The Crown on our pint glasses has been, for over three centuries, the symbol of a proper pint measure.\n\nThe EU wants to get rid of this British symbol in favour of its own symbol, further emphasising the growing, all-pervading control of the EU.\n\nWhat possible harm does the crown on the pint glass do to foreigners? Why must every little thing that is nice about this country be scrapped.\n\nThe undersigned ask the PM, for once, to stand up for our traditions and culture.",
