        "background": "I was born in 1972, so was oblivious to proposals to join a European common market, but as a 34  year old, I have to live with the consequences. If teens do not like a government, they only have to wait 4/5 years before being able to vote for somebody else, but those of us too young to have voted on EU membership can\u2019t have a say on our continued membership. \n\nI feel this is undemocratic, for all ages, not just for my age group. We have no way of voting for exit, or to become a partial member (Norway I think have done that). To have no official way of triggering another referendum or having one every so many years (ten for example) is un-democratic in my view and is not conducive to beneficial EU membership. \n\nWhether you agree with EU membership or not, I call on you to sign this petition to tell the PM that continued EU membership  should not be taken for granted. Things can go wrong with governments and other bodies, so not to have a way out is dangerous as well as undemocratic.",
