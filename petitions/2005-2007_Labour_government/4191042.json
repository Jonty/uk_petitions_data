            "background": "It is proposed that student loan accounts will shortly appear on people's credit files, potentially having a negative effect on their ability to obtain credit of any type. No-one who has signed for a student loan prior to 2007 will have given their permission for this information to be used for credit referencing purposes and this could be seen as invasion of privacy. It is also not possible to miss payments on a student loan and so the information is not necessary for credit referencing purposes. Therefore, under the Data Protection Act 1998, credit reference agencies should not be allowed to hold and share this information.",
