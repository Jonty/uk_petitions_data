            "background": "Decades ago (prior to the introduction of current fire safety guidance), a number of local authorities introduced Local Acts to improve the fire precations in buildings of certain types. This was appropriate at the time. However, subsequent national fire safety guidance and legilislation has removed the need for additional Local Acts and the remaining acts create unnecessary differential development costs, distort the approvals process and create differences in fire safety provisions.\n\nRemoving the Local Acts will exorcise an unnecessary anomaly in the Building Regulations process and create a fair playing field for the Building Regulations Approval market.",
