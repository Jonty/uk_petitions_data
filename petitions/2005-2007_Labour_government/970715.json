        "action": "prove he is not using gloable warming as an excuse to fleece motorists by upping gas, electricity, heating oil, bus, tram and train fuel taxes from their current nominal token levels to the around 350% (yes, three hundred and fifty percent) extorted from motorists.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "If the Prime Minister really thinks that Global Warming is a man-made problem and tax is the way to solve it then why do we pay 5% on heating the garden and lighting the night sky, why do buses not only reclaim most of their fuel tax, but get subsidies to drive around empty and even belch out soot while stopped, and why do trams and trains only pay nominal fuel taxes despite most of the fuel being wasted to haul tons of cast iron around town and country?",
