            "background": "It has recently come to light that our children are travelling to and from Cardinal Newman School, Luton, on Arriva buses with drivers who are not CRB checked.  Since September last year, 2 drivers have been dismissed following a series on worrying events:  \n\nYear 7 girls were shown adult material, on the drivers mobile phone WHILE HE WAS DRIVING THE BUS.  The images involved Jesus being run over by a bus, as well as cartoon characters and dolls having sex. One child was touched on the arm by this driver, who stated 'I cant wait to see you again'. Police interviewed the girl, and consequently Arriva dismissed the driver.\n\nChildren from the age of 11 have been forced to get off the bus and walk home,some several miles from their homes.  Quite worringly, this has been in the early evening.\n\n3 - 4 children have been forced to sit on 2 seater chairs, or stand for the entire duration of the journey, while a driver has driven the bus at speed, causing some children to sustain minor injuries as a result of falling or banging themselves.",
