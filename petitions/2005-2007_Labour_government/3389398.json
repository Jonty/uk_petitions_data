        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Why are some people in favour of splitting up the United Kingdom? So many of the problems in the world are produced by people/groups/countries etc... concentrating on their differences instead of looking at their similarities to solve global issues such as terrorism, global warming etc... We should be concentrating on uniting the world and forgetting our differences instead of dividing it which only results in greater overall conflict. Lets hold the UK together and stand up to the nationalists whom, I believe don't know what side effects would hit them (both long term and shot term) should they gain independence from this nation. The constituent countries of the UK have been together for the past 300 years - why end it now? Greater unity is what is missing not only from our own country but also to the rest of the world. This could help solve international intolerances and misunderstanding of other cultures. Let the UK lead by example.",
