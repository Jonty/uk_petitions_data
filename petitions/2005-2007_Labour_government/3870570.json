        "background": "The House of Lords should be reformed to make a House of Peers.  Three quarters of the members of this reformed chamber would be randomly selected from the electorate.  People would have the right to opt out of selection in advance and the selected members would be paid expenses and a salary.  Members would have rights similar to those of jurors or magistrates in terms of their employment etc.  The other quarter would be elected by organisations with an important role in our society, for example, the TUC, The Law Society, The BMA, The Royal Society, The Church of England etc.  This would maintain the presence in the House of people with specialist knowledge.  This House of Peers aspires to mirror the ideal of Athenian democracy, where the legislature was selected at random from the citizens.  This system would provide representation without introducing electioneering or divisive party politics to our second chamber: a House of our Peers.",
