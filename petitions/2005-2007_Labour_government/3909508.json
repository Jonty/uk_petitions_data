        "background": "There is an international day for women (March 8th) there is a world AIDS day (December 1st) and various other International or world days but there are eight countries that have an international men\u2019s day all at different times of the year and we in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland do not partake in this sort of event. If we recall, having anything set up for one of the sexes and not the other is classed as being sexist and this is against the law in this and many other countries in the world, but the lack of an international men\u2019s day is being sexist to the highest amount as it seems that men have now become the lesser important of the sexes in the world. How can any government say that they are trying to create an equal balance between the two genders when there is a special day for women and not for men?",
