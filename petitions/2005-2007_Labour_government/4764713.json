            "action": "Remove the Local Government Bill proposals to set up \"Joint Waste Authorities\" with the power to impose fortnightly waste collections and to therefore allow councils to abrogate their responsibilities for the proper, safe and healthy collection of waste.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At present, a large number of local councils have removed the right to weekly rubbish collections for persons in their area. This flies in the face of both World Health Organisation recommendations and various studies on the adverse effects to health and safety from reduced frequency of waste collections. Public opposition to such reductions may force local councils to resume weekly collections, particularly if Councillors believe that this may lose them their seats at Local Council Elections. The creation of \"Joint Waste Authorities\" will allow councils to escape accountability for the responsibility of waste collection. This means that voters will no longer be able, through the polling booth, to force councils to restore weekly waste collections. This is deliberate and blatant disenfranchisement by this Government.",
