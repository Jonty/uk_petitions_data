            "background": "In this country today it is far too easy for people with nothing wrong with them to claim thousands in benefits. I also think the soft penalties benefit fraudsters face are an incentive not a deterrent to commit benefit fraud. The punishment should fit the crime. I think they should pay back every single penny of fraudulently claimed benefits with interest in line with inflation.",
