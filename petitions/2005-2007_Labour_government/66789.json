        "background": "Old-fashioned hot filament light bulbs contribute to climate change, and cost more in the long term for the consumer. New low-energy bulbs are better for the environment.  Unfortunately standard low-energy bulbs are physically larger than the older bulbs, and do not fit all light fittings.  It would make sense if all new light fittings sold were able to take the physically larger bulbs.",
