        "background": "The Welsh Assembly through NHS Wales are denying cancer patients the funding of essential treatment and potential life-saving scans which are currently available in England. Since their formation, the assembly has spent in excess of 250 million pounds of public money on its own infrastructure and the building of an opera house that cannot be reached by 50% of the population of Wales.
