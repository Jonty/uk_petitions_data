            "background": "We believe the consumption of alcohol on trains should be banned, to stop elderly passengers and women travelling alone feeling intimidated by groups of people drinking alcohol.  \nFor many, trains become a no-go area after early evening.  \nIn addition, all passengers have chosen to board a train, and have not chosen to enter a pub, and should therefore not be forced to put up with the noise and lack of respect often associated with drinking alcohol, not to mention the usual smell of cheap lager.  \nAs similar bans have been successful in town centres, there is no reason why a ban could not be enforced in such a closed environment as a train.",
