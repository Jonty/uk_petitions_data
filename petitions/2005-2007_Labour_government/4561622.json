If a certain level of functionality is required and \"Product X\" is the only one to fulfil those requirements, no-one is going to put up with an inferior product just because it is more eco-friendly packaged.\n\nAn example of this is computer software on CD coming in a box as big as a family-sized Cornflakes pack, or a magnifying glass measuring 3\"x2\" coming in a hard plastic pack of 9\"x6\"\n\nYet the government want to make us consumers pay yet more money - over and above our ever-increasing council tax - for disposing of our refuse by way of a \"pay as you throw, bin tax\".\n\nIt is grossly unfair and a problem that should be solved at source, not by yet more taxation of people who have no control over it and cannot do anything about it.",
