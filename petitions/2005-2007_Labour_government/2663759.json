Without a source of well-trained musicians, our orchestras will become totally populated by foreign players (who continue to receive excellent musical tuition).\n\nThe sad thing is, that whilst the UK has the very best violin making school in the world (Newark, Nottinghamshire), there are not so many players in the UK that could benefit from owning a violin made by a Newark graduate! Such is the standard of musical education in the UK!",
