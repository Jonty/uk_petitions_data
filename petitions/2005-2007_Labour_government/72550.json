By so doing the nation will have a firm base for repentance \u2013 the turning away from, sorrow over and confession of wrongdoing against God. By repenting this nation has some chance of returning to its former strength under the Lordship of Jesus Christ. No action but that of repentance will turn the tide of lawlessness, hatred and wickedness that increasingly characterise the United Kingdom. Public reform, social work, education, and wealth may all be good, but they are only icing on the cake, the analogous cake being repentance.\nAs a minimum the Ten Commandments should be displayed in the courts, taught in schools and memorised by every person holding public office.",
