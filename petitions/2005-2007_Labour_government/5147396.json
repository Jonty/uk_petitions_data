            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Far too many abortions are being carried out as a method of birth control, ok  I agree that in very few cases abortions are acceptable, eg when a rape victim is left pregnant or if the mother & child would not survive the pregnancy.\nHowever I'm disgusted with the numbers of abortions that are being carried out purely as a form of contraception, females ( regardless of age or marital status) willing to participate in sexually activities whilst using contraceptives or not have to start facing upto  the consequences of there actions, the moment they decided to have sex they are aware that it's how babies are made & no form of contraception is 100%. Thats their choice & the risk they CHOOSE to take\nSadly when these methods do fail & a baby is made & seen as an inconvinience, the innocent child loses it's life through no action or fault of it's own,\nLet's give children a better education & make sure that they are aware that their are consequences to every action they take.\nThankyou.",
