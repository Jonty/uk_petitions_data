        "background": "As it stands absent parents (mainly fathers) are having to go through go courts at great expense to see their children and even after this cost to individuals the ex-wifes/partners do not have to apply to the court rulings and are allowed to get away with going against court-orders without punishment. They still continue to receive CSA payments even though they are breaking laws. If they wish to choose to stop the absent parents having contact with their children then they should be stopped CSA payments.",
