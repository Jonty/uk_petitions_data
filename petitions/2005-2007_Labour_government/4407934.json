If you don't punish someone for doing something wrong, they aren't going to stop doing it. We need to launch some kind of military attack on Iran after we have our people back (as Iran may harm them if we attack before they are released) so that Iran gets the picture that we aren't going to accept this kind of illegal and, quite honestly, disgusting behavior.",
