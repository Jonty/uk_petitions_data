Without fail, education and health are mentioned at this point, knowing full well that these 2 services are very important to us.  How about you divert some of the billions that you're spending on nuclear weapons and war mongering that the British public demonstrated against?  Or perhaps you could tone down your party conferences so they don't tally up to millions?  Or maybe you could ask the royals if they wouldn't mind getting a job....  Government seems to be a question of good marketing and I find it abhorrent.  It's about time politicians were brave enough to tell the truth and stopped treating us like the idiots we aren't.",
