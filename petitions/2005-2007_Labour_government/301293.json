He's a good guy, done a lot to make people happy and he is loveable and never say anything bad about anyone.  \n    Thank you for the years of running England and England is a better country since you been a prime minister.  Will miss you.  Any chance of you running for US President?   Just a wild thought.\nHave a Happy New Year.",
