This has happened with no real consultation and in total disregard of the consumer. The Office of Fair Trading and the competition commission exists to prevent this kind of behavior yet as the unchecked growth of Tesco's shows they are not effectively empowered. We propose this government gives both organisations the powers to police big business effectively.",
