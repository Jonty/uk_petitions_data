            "background": "There is a greaet deal of famous UK food such as Chedder cheese. However, many of these foods can be copied by foreign companies, produced abroad but sold under the UK name. It is possible to protect the name and type of food under the EU. Howver, the government seems to be very slow in pushing for more protection. This leads to a fall in quality of food for the consumer.",
