            "background": "Our economy is becoming increasingly knowledge driven, with ever more industry & commerce being out-sourced to lower labour-cost territories. It seems paramount that we teach our young people the skills they need to generate enterprise and knowledge-based businesses. \n\nMany schools teach engineering and science skills, as well as traditional humanities subjects, but fewer teach business studies or entrepreneurship to its students. Even economics has disappeared from the curriculum of many schools. \n\nEntrepreneurship should teach our young people the basics of the knowledge-based enterprise economy, how to plan, set up & run their own business, basic sales and marketing skills and how to appreciate the commercial realities of the job market.",
