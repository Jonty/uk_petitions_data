            "background": "The sport of coursing hares is a time honoured tradition of the countryside and banning it has caused more harm than good. The greyhounds that course the hares are now left redundant and many have had to be put down. I myself have a retired greyhound who was due to be put down had I not adopted him. The community surrounding coursing was a tightly knit one in which I met many great friends and people do not do it for money, 'blood lust' or cruelty, they do it for the enjoyment. It brings the whole community together and most of all the dogs enjoy it and that is the main thing.",
