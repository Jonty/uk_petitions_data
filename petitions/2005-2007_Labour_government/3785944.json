            "background": "The isolation effect of using these devices puts at risk the cyclist & the other road users.\n\nCyclists\u2019 engrossed in their music are prone to making directional changes without perception of other traffic around them (in the form of audible cues) and thereby place themselves at risk of personal injury or possible death. The additional impact upon 3rd parties involved in any incident is not to be disregarded either.\n\nSince use of a mobile phone is illegal while driving a car - not being fully aware of your environment should be illegal for cyclists.",
