What is the connection/representation to the London 2012 games. \nIf this was not the logo designed to represent London 2012 for the next five years it would almost be funny. Where is the London connection (other than the word London) and the Olympic colours?\nLets petition to get the government to apply pressure to have the logo changed. After it the 'peoples games' with a logo mostly hated by the people!",
