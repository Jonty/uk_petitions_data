        "background": "If you make an electronic transfer from one account to another bank, it currently takes 3 working days, during which time you lose interest on the money. When you use your debit card in an ATM or a shop, the money is debited from your account immediately. Therefore, the infrastructure to perform instant transfers is already in place, raising suspicion that the delay is artificial and merely helps to boost the banks' profits.",
