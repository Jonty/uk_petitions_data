            "background": "I make deliveries in a 7.5t lorry, around towns and villages. everyday i have to double park or block the traffic because people decide its there right to park in loading bays. Now if a traffic warden comes along i will receive a ticket for double parking, parking in a disabled area , parking in a taxi rank, and the same in bus stops. What is annoying the traffic wardens dont seem to bother with the cars parked in the loading bays. Majority of offenders are blue badge holders, Please dont get me wrong my mother is disabled. its annoying that us delivery drivers always seem to get penalised for trying to do our job.",
