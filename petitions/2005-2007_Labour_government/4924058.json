        "background": "Lets support a fun event. Close the M25 August Bank holiday weekend each year for a properly run full circuit race, with multiple class events, and maybe an all night race, \"Le Mans\" style, plus a once around for Motorcycles, and perhaps an open \"Gumball\" race, but all fully managed by F1 organisors, Silverstone team or similar. Road closed Saturday lunch to Sunday late PM. We all managed without the M25 for many years, this would be a MEGA event, and so many would enjoy. Crazy, yes, but why not support something just for some fun, and lets all get a little less serious sometimes. Tremendous viewing availability and world wide attraction.",
