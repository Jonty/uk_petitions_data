            "background": "The current sentencing structure for these offenders is not adequate and goes against the majority of public opinion. It is time this government, elected by the people, actually listened to public demand and put these offenders away for life. We petition that, instead of frivolously wasting tax payers money (the Millenium dome a prime example), that more prisons be built to accommodate these offenders and that they serve a term of life imprisonment. Listen to the public outcry - Life should mean Life for these criminals and keep women and children safe.",
