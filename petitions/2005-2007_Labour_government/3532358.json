In wet weather and sray you cannot see other vehicles in your mirrors, especially as most cars now seem to be silver in colour and just blend in with the spray.\n\nSome other countries and provinces of Canada make it law that dipped headlights are used at all times, this could be a solution but a little extreme.\n\nPlease sign this petition to change the law and help make driving safer.",
