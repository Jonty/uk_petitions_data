        "background": "Hong Kong SAR Government has successfully applied funding from Hong Kong Legislative Council, to demolish Queen's Pier at Central for Chinese PLA Perth after reclamation work in Victoria Harbour.\n\nQueen's Pier is not ordinary pier in Hong Kong. Every Governor of Hong Kong before 1997 landed at this place. The historic value for UK is unmeasurable.\n\nOn the other hand, this pier is named in the name of our Queen, the Elizabeth II. How Hong Kong SAR government can remove the building which is named in our Queen without UK permission?\n\nThe most important point is that Chinese government will place PLA perth in the current site of Queen's pier. What does it means behind this action?\n\nTherefore, I hope Prime Minister to stop HKSAR government decision as possible.",
