            "background": "Whilst the argument rages on as to whether the UK should or should not join the Euro, British banks continue to make huge charges for changing between the GBP and the EUR. Whilst the variations of exchange rate due to market speculation make business and personal transactions unpredictable. It is unacceptable that the situation is exacerbated by high charges for changing money between ourselves and our main trading partners. Furthermore, the exchange rate should be set at the moment of order and not allowed to drift during the several days it takes the average UK bank to effect the exchange. Encourage and facilitate the transfer of funds electronically between the two currencies thus cutting out the cost to the UK and Euro banks.",
