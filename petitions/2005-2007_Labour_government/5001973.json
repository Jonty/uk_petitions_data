            "background": "Every year thousands of man hours are wasted during the recruitment process by teachers. This is because nearly every school has a different application form to complete. These all request the same information, but are created in-house by the school and therefore have to be completed individually. Why not have a universal DFES form which can be used for all schools and save time that can be better spent with students?! It could even be an online DFES form that could be completed and saved. A list of schools on a drop-down menu could allow you to email it direct and, if really clever, to attach a letter of application also! Isn't that what technology is for? At the very least, a universal electronic form for download and completion would save eons of time!",
