            "background": "UCAS recently announced plans to require university applicants to declare their parents' level of education and there occupations. This would not appear to have any relevance to the applicant's abilities. This, in the petitioner's view, amounts to unjustified discrimination. Moreover, it is a disincentive to self-improvement as it will lead to concerns that the applicants university attendance will lead to discrimination against the applicant's own children in the future, when they are applying to university.",
