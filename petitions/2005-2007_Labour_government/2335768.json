            "background": "As we now live in a 'gambling is OK' nation, we should change income tax to a form of lottery ticket which will give prizes.  This will lead to less tax evasion as people would have a chance of winning money every month.  I would suggest 1% of that collected is returned in prizes, the rest can be given to the usual 'good causes' that tax is normally given to, such as MP's salaries, heads of nationalised industries, defence and other worthy causes.",
