            "background": "In the interests of democracy, I feel that it is necessary to allow the residents of the Isle of Wight and anywhere else for that matter, to petition the Prime Minister to decide against the construction of any type of fixed link to the Isle of Wight.\nThis petition is in response to the one in favour of a fixed link.\nOver the years, a few activists have tried to keep alive their dream of a bridge or tunnel from the mainland. This is despite the vast majority of Island residents, including the I.O.W. Council, being firmly against the idea of a fixed link.\nThe Island has functioned and will continue to function to the satisfaction of most of it's residents. \nIt is one of the most desirable places to live and for holidays it is in the top ten destinations in Britain.\nIt is not some run down charity case as depicted by the pro-linkers.\nTheir hidden agenda has nothing to do with anything other than the financial outlay  required to commute to the mainland every day. \nThe Isle of Wight is not part of the London commuter belt. It is an Island. Let us keep it that way.\nPlease vote in your thousands for this petition against any form of fixed link to the Isle of Wight. Thank you.",
