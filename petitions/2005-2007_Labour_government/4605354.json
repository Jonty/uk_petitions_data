This is said to be with a view to raising funds to improve victim support in cases of domestic violence. This worthwhile aim should be funded  out of general taxation and by getting those who commit motoring offences and other minor offences to pay more is contrary to the rules of natural justice, or would be if they existed any longer! There are plans to extend the scheme to fixed penalty notices which will only increase the injustice",
