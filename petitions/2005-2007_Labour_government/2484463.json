        "background": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to raise the threshold for VAT and import duty to \u00a35,000 per private individual in any given tax year.\n\nThis will cover importation of, for example, electric guitars and anything else for which we do not have a significant manufacturing base in the UK.\n\nThis will help end the constant dollar for pound pricing mechanism rip off. \n\nThat is, if an item sells for 2,000 US Dollars in the USA we get to pay \u00a32,000 for it in the UK.\n\nIn the case of high end guitars, it is almost cheaper to fly to the USA, buy the item, bring it home and pay the relevant taxes at the airport - or to do much the same via eBay.\n\nWith a higher personal inport threshold this will force distributors / resellers into the position where they have to price more fairly so that we consumers get a fairer deal.",
