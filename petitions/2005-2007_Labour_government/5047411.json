Give fathers 1 month off on full pay and up to 2 months on 50% pay which must be taken in the childs first year. Ensure that parents jobs remain open for 1 year and where possible try to provide companies with the ability to provide in-house child care such as creches etc, which will help encourage parents to go back to work even if only part-time to start with.\nAfter the childs first year if the parent decides not to return to his/her job and they have a partner who is working, the partners tax rate for the next 2 years will only be 10% and those earning below 20k per annum will be entitled to help with their rent and council tax.\nDo not penalise the family unit encourage it and help it to provide a better start for the child and remove the stress that a loss of income can put on a family especially, first time parents as well as encouraging companies and businesses to provide more assistance to there employees",
