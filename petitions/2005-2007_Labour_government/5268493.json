            "background": "How many of you out there know of a person that is elderly or disabled and cannot cook for themselves, may be they already have community meals or meals on wheels cooked fresh and delivered to them, but that will end soon in your borough and change to a frozen option that they may have to cook for themselves.\n\nIt sounds silly i know to think that social services have assessed that they cant cook because of disability or of other factors, but government and local councils will ignore those reasons and force them to take the frozen option, which will mean they have to cook, even though they have been deemed in capable of doing so in order to save pennies. So where is the care and consideration, a fortnightly delivery of frozen food instead of the day to day delivery of community meals or meals on wheels, where is the QUALITY OF LIFE, there is non,no contact just the ping of a microwave.",
