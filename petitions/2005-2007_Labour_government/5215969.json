            "background": "A new logo has been unveiled for the London 2012 Olympics at a cost of \u00a3400,000 of taxpayer\u2019s money. This helps explain the incompetence of the organisers in delivering an Olympics billions over budget. We already had a perfectly good logo. The logo is embarrassing and is not a true portrayal of our country.\n\nThere are much better logo designs sent in on the BBC website, sent in by viewers. These Olympics were supposed to be about the involvement of young people. The new logo could have been selected from public entries in the form of a competition with a prize much less than \u00a3400,000. A lot of money has been spent on a logo that\u2019s an embarrassment.\n\nI am proud and looking forward about the Olympics coming to London and for that reason we need to get this hideous logo scrapped.",
