I belive that Children are a gift from God and a childhood is precious and all children should be brought up in a loving hetrosexual family, as is God's law. Let us all remember that the laws of man are worthless against the laws of God. Those who wish to make these laws that go against God's law will someday answer and pay dearly for their sins.",
