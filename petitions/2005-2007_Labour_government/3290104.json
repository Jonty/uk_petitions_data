        "background": "The condition apparently affects somewhere in the region of 40% of the world's population, of course it is not a life threatening condition - however arguably there is not one \"non-lethal\" condition ever to exist that causes more personal trauma, than acne.\n\nPlease could we look into the prospect of establishing some kind of research task force with all the investment they need, assigned the following two objectives:\n\n1) To investigate the means by which existing 'treatments' to reduce the problem can be enhanced, or to discover a new powerful far stronger treatment than those that already exist.\n\n2) To investigate the possibility of the world's first permanent 'cure' for this widespread condition.\n\nWith the money and expertise that we have today, it's about time in my view that somewhere in the world this problem is solved.\n\nLet's step up and try to help billions of people in the future avoid this painful stage in their lives.\n\nRegards,\nChristopher Mendes",
