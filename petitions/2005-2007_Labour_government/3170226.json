Wounding, slightly or otherwise a police officer, in the execution of his/her duty should also carry a mandatory prison sentence of anything from 10 years upwards.   It is about time our police officers had the backing and protection they have long deserved. They increasingly put their lives on the line everytime they go on duty with very little respect and thanks from some of the public.",
