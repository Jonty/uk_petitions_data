            "background": "More and more money is being put into public transport, but I will still not be tempted to use it because of youths (especially) playing their music on their music players really loudly, almost as though the rest of the world wants to hear their music.\nSomething needs to be done about it, because it creates a bad atmosphere on buses especially, and so leads to people being less inclined to use public transport. There is no problem with them listening to their music, I do it to pass the time, but I do not want to listen to theirs. They should be banned from using the transport or something similar.",
