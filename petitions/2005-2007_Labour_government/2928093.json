            "background": "I would like the goverment to give financial assistance to every grandparent bringing up grandchildren as their own.At the momment it is up to individual LA's to give financial asistance, if they do, it is some times paid as kinship allowance, some times means tested. I do not think this is right, it should be automatically paid to grandparents and at the same rate nationwide.We as grandparents take on our grandchildren through no fault of our own. We are left struggling to make ends meet, our lives are full of worry. A lot of us are finding our selves in debt. Grandparents mostly are of pension age and we are supposed to bring grandchildren up on our pensions, it is hard enough to look after our selves with out scraping the barrel to keep our grandchildren out of the LA care system.\nRO and SGO are not automatically financed. If SGO finance is payable the LA's are using clause 9 and 10 by paying for 2yrs only. Please help to support us financially.",
