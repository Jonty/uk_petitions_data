        "background": "We call on the Prime Minister to hold a review into the closure of daycare facilities for those with disability and special needs, we feel that in many cases local government are using central government guidelines to close centres to save money.\nThere is also a loss of specialist care such as physiotherapy, hydrotherapy and dental care, specialist medical consultants are being lost leading to suffering by many.\nIt is very much overlooked that daycare is also a form of respite, if the centres are closed many long term  carers,caring for their children for 50 years or more will go under, this will lead to greater cost to government.\nWe request the Prime Minister hold an urgent review before it is to late for many.",
