        "background": "If the propossed cuts are allowed to take place the canal system will revert to the situation which arose around the late 60's where there was major problems on the system caused by years of neglect. The British water-way system will allow if maintained heavy & bulk goods to be moved by water instead of by road.\nIt will also provide work for people involved in the maintenance of the canals togther with work for boat builders & repairers.\nIt will provide monies for the government from peoples leisure activities help reduce green house gasses as people will take holidays in the UK instead of going abread.\n\nThe cut of \u00a37,000,000 over the next few years is peanuts in the total funding of DEFRA and surely cuts can be found elsewhere other than the canals.",
