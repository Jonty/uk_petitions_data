            "background": "There are many students who were misled into taking on huge debts and entering university where they were clearly at the end of their student life. Parents and teachers actively promoted the government and community promoted line, encouraging young people to go onto university when they were unsure. Many dropped out and will never repay the 15000-20000 debt. They live tormented lives as a result. And they would otherwise have been on the dole getting around the same amount of goverment finacial support without the debt or at work. i call on the prime minister to wipe out this unfair debt. The debt has a cost to struggling young people with no hope of light at the end of the tunnel, just debt.",
