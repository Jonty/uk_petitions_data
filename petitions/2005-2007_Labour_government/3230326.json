            "background": "The problem of congestion is often made worse by the number of lorries on the road during the day. Although I am not apposed to lorries using the roads during the day they are often the cause of congestion by their slow overtaking manouvers of other lorries. I believe that the government could offer reduced tax and duty for lorries that travel mainly at night. This would free up the roads and remove the need for road charging",
