            "background": "As it stands, legal aid is not granted to someone claiming divorce if they are living with another partner. This means the new partner takes on the full cost of divorce etc, and if they can't afford it, a divorce isn't possible. A means of financially evaluating situations for divorce should be created with the focus on their ability to comforatably afford costly solicitor fees. If not, legal aid should be granted. A millionaires ability to afford solicitor fee's is different to a newly formed couple living in an estate. The cost of divorce is unnecessary and the whole point of divorcing is to start a new life. Not at a cost of ruining new relationships.",
