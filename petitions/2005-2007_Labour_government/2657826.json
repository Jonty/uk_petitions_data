            "background": "Land is Britain's most precious resource but increases in house prices are not fed through into the economy to benefit everyone.  Seventy per cent of Britain's land is owned by only 1% of its population - mostly by the landed gentry who, through trusts and offshore \"investment\" contrive to pay little or no UK tax, even through inheritance tax.\n\nLand Value taxation works by capturing a small percentage of the rental value of all land.  Parks and sites of special scientific interest would be zero rated.  Hotels would end up paying the most, but unused/derelict sites would also have to pay - thus putting paid to the blight of many inner cities.  Who would leave a site derelict when they could develop it and earn money - instead of losing it?\n\nMost house owners would be better off.",
