            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "All councils should provide facilities to those who wish to practise naturism. This legislation should include the rights of the individual to partake of sports and recreational facilities provided by the councils without clothing.We believe that not to allow naked persons the same rights as others is inaproptiate and against the human rights legislation adopted by national government.To be fair to those who practice naturism ALL council run activities and amienities should have propotional time allocated to them alloted on the basis of the percentage of population residing in the area.there already exists legislation which allows for the use of public swimming pools to be restricted to women/men only sessions and we feel that this should be extended to include naturists.Futher to this ALL councils with coastal areas should provide nudist beach areas for the safe use of naturists.",
