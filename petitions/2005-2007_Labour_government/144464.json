        "background": "To have an elected House of Lords would simply add another layer of bureaucracy to the political system.  As voting turnout has decreased to serious levels, another set of elections is not going to improve the current apathy throughout the UK.  The brilliance of our upper chamber is the wealth of knowledge and expertise that it currently holds.  The majority have spent a near lifetime in politics and are thus able to see the wider picture, than would the regular man from the street.  We must protect this traditional aspect of our political lives for the good of all.",
