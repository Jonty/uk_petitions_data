            "background": "We believe that the EU Reform Treaty should only come into effect after approval in a national referendum.  The Treaty is substantially similar to the proposed EU Constitution on which the electorate were promised a referendum at the last election.  The Reform Treaty will bring about significant constitutional change and the case for a referendum on it is just as strong as it was for a referendum on the proposed EU Constitution.",
