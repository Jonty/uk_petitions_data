        "background": "Residents of the London Borough of Redbridge are deeply concerned at the Council's land sales programme, which aims to raise \u00a3100-\u00a3150 million through selling off Council land for development.  \n\nSites being sold include popular local allotments and other open spaces, well-used car parks that are vital for local shopping centres, as well as other Council property.  The consequential damage to the local environment, community and economy will be impossible to reverse if the Council's programme goes ahead.\n\nDecisions on the future of these local assets are being taken behind closed doors and with the minimum of public consultation.",
