            "background": "The biggest contributor to global warming is not homes but hundreds of millions of people commuting to work every day across the world. UK Government should encourage more people who can to work at home through tax incentives for individuals and companies. Take few million from daily commute would reduce carbon emmissions, congestion on roads and public transport and stress, will boost local economies and saves cost of introducing new congestion or road charging. Office complexes also produce hundreds or thousands of times more carbon emmissions than homes.",
