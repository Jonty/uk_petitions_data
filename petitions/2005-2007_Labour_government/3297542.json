Subsequently the Prime Minister issued an email to all of those who signed the petition essentially saying that their voices have been heard and consequently ignored.  This completely invalidates the point of this web site and only goes toward proving that this site only exists to decieve the public that their opinions matter.  If 1.8M signatures carry no weight, what confidence can the public have of any other petition being listened to? (unless, of course, it agrees with what the government has already decided upon)",
