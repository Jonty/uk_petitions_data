            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are 36 children in the village of Weldon attending state schools in King's Cliffe. Previously a bus was run by the council which charged parents \u00a3300 p.a. per child to sit alongside free travelling children (they live in villages nearer to their schools but are nevertheless entitled to free transportation). Northamptonshire CC stopped the bus picking up in Weldon as a 'cost cutting exercise'; the bus still runs (indeed the council are also inexplicably providing a TAXI for 4 children on the free bus route!)& even still goes through our village but WON'T pick up our 36 children or accept our \u00a310,800 pa! Parents are having to take children by car - unsafe & environmentally bad - or privately hire a bus at a much greater individual cost; parents are struggling to afford this option. This ridiculous situation that can be easily remedied by reinstating the bus starting September 2007. The Council gets the additional revenue & the children get safely to their state education.",
