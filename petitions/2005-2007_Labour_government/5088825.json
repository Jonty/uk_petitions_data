            "background": "The Government is considering a billion pound-plus sale of the country\u2019s canals and waterways. \n\nBritish Waterways, the government-controlled body responsible for 2,200 miles of canals and rivers in the UK, is running a beauty parade of banks with a view to kick-starting a strategic review in the summer. The review will examine all options for the business, including a sale of all or parts of the portfolio, a possible stock market listing or other partnership or funding structures. \n\nA sale could raise as much as \u00a31 billion for the Treasury.\n\nThis would be a disaster for the WHOLE country.\n\nA disaster for the people who enjoy the beautiful countryside from a narrowboat or other boats, a disaster for anglers and a disaster for ramblers, hikers and cyclists who all appreciate the waterways.\nSign this petition to stop this Government Destroying our Waterways.",
