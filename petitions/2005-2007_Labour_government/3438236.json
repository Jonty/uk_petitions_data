            "background": "The aggressive and bullying style of rhetoric towards muslim governments and people applied by our government and the Americans is designed to escalate differences between us and cause discord between our two civilisations. Let this be changed to a discussion based on understanding and friendly diplomatic persuasion more appropriate to civilised behaviour which takes account of the views and needs of the other nations. It is much more likely to be successful and will improve trust between us.",
