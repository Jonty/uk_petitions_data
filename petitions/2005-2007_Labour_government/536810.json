        "action": "Allow the siting of speed cameras where there is danger from speeding vehicles without insisting that there has to have been actual deaths on that road.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently lives have to be sacrificed before a speed camers can be erected.  Speed kills and there is no justification for exceeding the speed limit.  Speeding traffic also intimidates pedestrians and often makes that road a no-go area for pedestrians, thus allowing speeding vehicles to get away with it because no one is fool enough to walk down the road. Speed cameras do work and the law should be changed to allow a camera to be sited as a deterrent wherever it is needed.  Let the roads be made safe for pedestrians once again.  The responsibility should lie with the Police Chief Constable. The police should be held as negligent if they do not take effective action to reduce speeding drivers.",
