            "background": "Many parents, teachers and religious leaders are becoming considerably concerned and vocal regarding the types of material which minors are subjected to - notably those with \"explicit content\" or those allegedly harmful to minors, such as the Harry Potter stories. However one book which is within children's reach on many bookstore shelves or at home by the coffee table, is the Bible. This book contains such stories as Lot becoming drunk and having intercourse with his daughters, religiously motivated ethnic cleansing, not to mention numerous episodes of magic, witchcraft, executions, and raising people from the dead. It is time that this book was classed strictly for adults only and removed to the top shelf in shops, and bore a \"parental advisory: explicit content\" on all further publications of this material.",
