        "background": "Blairs Government have betrayed this country with every decision based on lies, lies upon lies and false statistics.   Everything we touch, see, breathe, hear and need to survive is toxically tainted with the stench of Tony Blairs hypocritical vision of running our life's. This Government has  chosen to digest George Orwells 1984 and Animal Farm and translated them as a roadmap for our future rather than the most obvious warnings ever written.  It is time to put people above politics once more which I and millions have always believed was the true definition of democracy.",
