It it practically impossible to deal with the organisations who arrange the mass mailings but the Organisations who advertise in this way do have a geographical presence and do have arrangements with Banks to process payments made by Credit/Debit card. Cutting off payments to the advertising businesses will soon make most commercial SPAM pointless.",
