They pushed through planning permission to demolish the chimneys, full of promises to restore the building, but instead immediately flogged it for a \u00a3240 profit, since the value of the site had increased hugely as a result of planning permission to demolish the chimneys.  Profit not renovation was evidently their aim.",
