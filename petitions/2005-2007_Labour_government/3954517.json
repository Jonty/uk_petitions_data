            "action": "eliminate the new wave of environmental nuisance and damage being caused by privately owned helicopters and light, internal combustion-driven aircraft taking off and flying low over quiet residential districts and recreational countryside areas.  The ownership and use of helicopters should ideally be limited to the public services. If private individuals are to be allowed to operate them they should only take off and land at designated airfields and should not be permitted to fly below 5000 feet.",

            "background": "It is becoming fashionable for \"Toad of Toad Halls\" to fly noisy helicopters for entertainment from their back gardens, and microlight fliers to dominate the skies at scenic areas such as escarpments and sea cliffs, with no respect for the environmental quality they destroy.  The skies are becoming an almost continuous source of unsilenced exhaust noise. The vast majority want some peace and quiet in the air.",
