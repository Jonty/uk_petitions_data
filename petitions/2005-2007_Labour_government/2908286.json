            "background": "Remove the restriction on disabled drivers stopping on double yellow lines at UK airports. Disabled drivers are the easy target for the parking wardens hoping to increase their bonuses.  We should be allowed time to check notice boards for arrival times and allowed to drop off passengers without threat of persecution.  This would not cause disruption to others at the airports I have visited. (An independant survey would confirm this.)  Manchester & Liverpool. Long unused service access roads now have double yellow markings and not able to be used.  The truth is airport authorities who control these bye laws want to extort huge fees for short term parking. (I am sure they will come up with an excuse.Security? Why not everyone else is using this.)  \nAn addition to my proposal would be free Disabled short term parking close to lifts at airports. \nMost disabled people dont ask for hand outs. Just reasonable assistance to live our lives the same as those more fortunate.",
