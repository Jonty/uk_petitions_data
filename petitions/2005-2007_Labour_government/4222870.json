            "background": "The proposed $4.50 charge by BT for payment either by cash or by cheque as from 1st May is in our opinion is extortion. This is our view is just another way of a multi-national raising revenue by Big Brother antics. The only alternative that is being offered by BT is to sign up for a direct debit. This in our opinion is another way of gaining more information relating to bank accounts which we feel is an intrusion upon our privacy.",
