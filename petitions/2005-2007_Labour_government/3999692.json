        "background": "The governmant would have you believe that the biggest contributing factor to climate change is CO2 emissions. They would also have you believe that this is the belief of \"most\" leading scientists. Its not! More importantly, the goevernment expects the tax payer to fund a cut in CO2 emissions in a futile attempt to help slow down / stop climate change. Lets have a proper scientific debate of the facts and re-think our approach. There's more important things the time and money could be spent on.",
