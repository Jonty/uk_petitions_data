            "background": "It is our opinion that the CAFCASS service provides little benefit to the resolution of child access dsiputes. In fact the philosophy of CAFCASS that they are not interested in child welfare matters and that children must see the absent parent regardless of what the individual is like or has been like in the past can only lead to emotional harm for any child in the long term as well as the short term whilst in that persons care. We therefore seek to restructure the system to remove CAFCASS from its current advisory role to the magistrates in order that a decison may be made by the courts (if required) without bias favouring the absent parent.",
