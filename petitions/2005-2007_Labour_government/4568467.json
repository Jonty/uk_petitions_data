In his first two years he won two Premierships, the Carling League Cup and the Community Shield. \n\nThis season he has won us the Carling League Cup and taken us to the semi-finals of the Champion's League and the FA Cup. Our squad has been ravaged by injury yet he has guided us back to within 3 points of the leaders who we have yet to play at home.\n\nWe ask your assistance to plead common sense with the Directors of the Club....Jose must stay!",
