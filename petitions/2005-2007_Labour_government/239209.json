            "background": "I propose that calculating income tax based upon the total family (parental) income, rather than the income of each individual, is a far fairer way of taxing single income families.\n\nUnder the current structure one family with two parents earning up to \u00a333,300 per year each can achieve a total family income of \u00a366,600 per year at the 22% tax rate. However, another family with one single income (perhaps a single parent family, or where one parent has chosen to stay at home to look after children) can only achieve an income of \u00a333,300 per year before being taxed the higher rate of 40%. The single income family therefore receive a significantly higher tax burden than the two income family for an equivalent gross income. \n\nPlease consider making increased allowance for families with one single income.",
