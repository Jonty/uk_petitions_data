        "background": "This, of course, affects people without bank accounts who in any case tend to be poorer than the average; so they have to pay more because they can't afford to pay less!  Others, such as myself, are opposed to paying by Direct Debit because it puts all the power in the hands of the payee; e.g. I once sent one company a signed Direct Debit mandate, together with a cheque for arrears, and they not only cashed the cheque but also took the arrears from my account via the mandate!  After this experience I am happy to pay by STANDING ORDER but NOT Direct Debit",
