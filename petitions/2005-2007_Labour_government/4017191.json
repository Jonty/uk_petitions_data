Others, such as myself, are opposed to paying by Direct Debit because it puts all the power in the hands of the payee; e.g. I once sent one company a signed Direct Debit mandate, together with a cheque for arrears, and they not only cashed the cheque but also took the arrears from my account via the mandate!  After this experience I am happy to pay by STANDING ORDER but NOT Direct Debit",
