Road Pricing? ID Cards? Anti-Terrorism Laws? You used to be the best thing that had happened to this country since the end of World War II. Do you honestly believe you still are? What an absolute shame your career is ending so badly. Be decent, be honest and, please, just think about what you are doing to our beautiful, liberal, free nation.",
