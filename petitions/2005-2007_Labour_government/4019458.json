            "background": "Railway travel is very London-centric. All the railways lines meet in the centre and in order to travel by rail it is too often necessary to take a train to the centre of London, then travel to the correct terminus to make a connection.\n\nIf the government were to fund the building and running of 2 orbital railways lines, one approximately at the M25 border, the other approximately at the North / South Circular, this would enable commuters to make journeys without entering the centre of London at all. It would also make rail travel more feasible for many journeys which at present are suitable only for a car.\n\nOnce built, all the radial routes that cross these orbital routes should stop at stations with interchanges.\n\nThe trains on the orbital routse should also be frequent enough to make them attractive, i.e. at least every 10 minutes at peak times, preferably every 5.",
