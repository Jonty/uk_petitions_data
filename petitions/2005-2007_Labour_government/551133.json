            "background": "Many home owners have faced rising costs over the last several years inluding soaring costs of council tax. Many councils have annually increased their council tax above the rate of inflation. Average earnings have not risen at the same rate, and the average person's disposable income is being squeezed to the point that nearly all of their earnings are spent on essential services. There can be no justification to increase council tax even further simply due to a rise in house prices. We need more of a say on the way that money is spent (and sometimes wasted) by councils.  We are paying more and getting less for our money!",
