            "background": "The Prime Minister has stated in a speech that he wishes to reduce CO2 emissions in Britain by so many percent by 2010. But does he seem to be even trying to meet this target? Its time we really did something about it and we got rid of people carriers. I mean who needs them (unless the owner needs a people carrier to get the whole family in), they are a monstrosity to the enviroment. If someone owns one and only has 1 or 2 children, its a waste of money. Now, who wants to waste money? Have you ever parked somewhere and been blocked in by one of these as well. They are nothing but trouble! Everyone who needs them, shall keep them.",
