        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Why is is that once a tennant has been placed in a council house they can continue living there, paying a much lower rent than those in the private sector, even when they get a well paid job? I think that once a tennant gets a job and ceases to receive benefits then their case should be reviewed and if they can afford a private rent in the area they should be assisted to more. That way there will be more houses avaliable and a lower waiting list for those who genuinely need the councils help.",
