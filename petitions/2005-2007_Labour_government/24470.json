            "background": "The Hunting Act 2004 only allows dogs to be used to flush out wild mammals if they are either immediately shot or hunted by a bird of prey.  The Act should be ammended to allow flushing of wild mammals to disperse them if the wild mammals are then allowed to escape without being killed.  A law against hunting that requires animals to be killed is absurd and should be changed.",
