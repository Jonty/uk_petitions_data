        "background": "A trial is being proposed in northern Ireland whereby council officials are allowed to enter your home to evaluate it for council tax. If successful it will probably move to England. An Englishman's home is his castle - or used to be.  It is grossly unfair that if you improve your home's interior, this should be used to increase your council tax.  An identical house next door which has been allowed to go to rack and ruin would pay less tax.  Nobody should be allowed inside your home unless invited or you are suspected of criminal activity.",
