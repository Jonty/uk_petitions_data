        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This huge development includes 382,000 sq metres of warehousing, plus associated rail sidings and road infrastructure, covering open countryside, and will operate 24hours a day, increasing traffic on the already congested M20 and associated local roads. The M20 is frequently closed in this area due to accidents, and the entire local road network around Maidstone and surrounding villages grinds to a halt. Why bring the lorries all the way to Maidstone? Surely the environmently friendly way is to locate this interchange nearer to the port of entry. Please support us, and sign our petition",
