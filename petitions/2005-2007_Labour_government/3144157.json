        "action": "ensure that all legislation and taxes relating to environmental impact take in to account the total lifecycle impact of the measures",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The vast majority of current legislation and taxes being created suffer from unintended impact because they look at a single aspect and so force actions that are actually counter productive.\n\nFor instance, whether an electric vehicle or even a hybrid is more environmentally freindly depends upon the impact of generating the electricity, not to mention the environmental impact of manufacturing complex electrical systems.\n\nsimilarly, it is often more environmentally freindly to keep an older less fuel efficient car than scrapping it to buy a modern car provided it is properly serviced.\n\nor taxing parking spaces in london causes people to concrete over their gardens preventing water from soaking in to the ground so both causing flooding and preventing the water table from recovering after a droubt.",
