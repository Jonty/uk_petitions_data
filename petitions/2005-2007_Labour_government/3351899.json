If the Government truly value the British Voter they should have Ministers highlight on the news a segment that discusses topic\u2019s from this petition e-Community, or by Pod Cast on the PM\u2019s site on a monthly basis giving regard to the originator to validate the e-Petitioner. Voting these days has a low turn out because the Community feel undermined, using the e-Petition system as a continued sense of worth and acting on them will in fact create a valued potential voter. Make our vote count and let us have our say!",
