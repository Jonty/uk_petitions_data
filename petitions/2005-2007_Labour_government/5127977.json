            "background": "Evidently, the existing sex offenders register is not working. There is a lot of confusion to the reasons why somebody is convicted of a sex offence. As the law currently stands, a 16 year old boy for example, who is having sex with his 15 year old girlfriend, is currently held in the same light as a 40+ year old male having sex with a 13 year old girl. I want to see this law changed. I want to see the laws on Paedophiles clearly defined. A paedophile is a person who preys on young children. I want to see those convicted of being Paedophiles, tattooed with a P on their foreheads. Let there be no mistake about their identity. Forget Paedophiles rights, what about our childrens rights? Our Children are our future, its about time we do more to protect them.",
