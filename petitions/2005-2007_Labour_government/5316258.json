        "background": "Having the capital in the extreme Southern part of our country is proving divisive. It also makes us susceptible to increasing Eurocentralization. \n\nLiverpool is the ideal site for Britain's capital because it is near Wales, and relatively near Scotland and Ireland, while it is also not so far from Southern England. \n\nLondon is also too crowded and pricey for normal people. Moving the capital to Liverpool would be an economic boost for the North West, but also help the South East's economy to become more balanced by encouraging cheaper and more reasonable house prices and less overcrowding.",
