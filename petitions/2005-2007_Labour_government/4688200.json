            "background": "Chemist+Druggist magazine does not agree with plans by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Authority to change the status of medicines containing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine from pharmacy (P) to prescription only (POM) status by the end of this year.\n\nAdditional controls to pharmacy supply would instead ensure patients have the choice to get appropriate medicines for minor ailments from a convenient local source and avoid them having to visit their GP. It would widen patient access to medicines while limiting the opportunity for the products to be diverted for illegal use in the production of methylamphetamine.\n\nAt the same time it would reinforce the government's pledge to enhance the role of pharmacists in primary care. \n\nFor these reasons we are urging the MHRA to Stop the Switch.\n\nPlease add your name below to support our campaign.",
