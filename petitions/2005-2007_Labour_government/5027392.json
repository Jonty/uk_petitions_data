            "background": "The Education Maintenance Allowance is an unfair system of bribery which pays certain students wanting to study after 16 the sum of \u00a330 a week. But then there are other students who also wish to study after 16 who could be doing exactly the same course, at the same college, learning the same things except they can not rececive the \u00a330 a week because the household income is higher then the amount stated by the EMA. Either the system is made fairer or it should be brought down.",
