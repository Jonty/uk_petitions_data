However without even asking for, let alone OBTAINING, permission to do so this charity passed my details to other charities, and these charities, in turn, passed my details to others, so that I received appeals, to which (being on a fixed income)I was unable to respond, from all sorts of charities of which I had never even heard.  They all sent very persuasive literature, and it was obvious they all had very worthy aims, but this has caused me (and, almost certainly, everyone else to whom it has happened) considerable annoyance, inconvenience, and guilt (at not being able to respond to these appeals).  I would therefore request that instead of the system being one of opt-out,  as it currently is, it should be changed to one of opt-IN.",
