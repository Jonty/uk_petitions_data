            "background": "The complexity of taxation causes great difficulty in collecting and administering.  They are also unfair in virtually every case.  Income is a simple basis for taxation as is expenditure.  Virtually all other taxes are unfair on one sector or another.  Sell a house for \u00a3119,999 NO TAX, add one penny and pay tax on the whole \u00a3120,000.  Save all your life and not purchase highly taxed goods and when you die your children will be taxed on the inheritance.  Petition for a TWO TAX SYSTEM FOR THE UK.  Simple, cheap and virtually inescapable.  Please support this petition.  Thank you.",
