            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Safety reviews require a balance between: the extent of a risk, the measures proposed to mitigate that risk, and the cost and the consequences of those measures.  Concerned at being sued about a particular risk, local authorities can narrow their perspective and adopt proposals that are clearly inappropriate.  Rather than promoting a safety culture, such proposals are unpopular, generate resistance and will ultimately fail to meet their objectives.\n\nFollowing a drowning incident elsewhere, Leeds City Council has proposed to fence the river Wharfe in Otley.  Generations of local children have been brought up to be aware of the danger and the river has remained essentially unfenced.  Substantial and very extensive riverside fencing has been proposed without assessing the actual risk from historical data. Some safety improvements are needed but the proposed barrier is disproportionate.  It will break the existing links with the river and make the water more attractive to many children.",
