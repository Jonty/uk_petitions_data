            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There have been a number of problems with the Blackdown hills area of the A30/303 Monkton to Newtown Road as as a result of it not being a dual carriageway yet. The traffic sometimes crawls at 20 mph as a result of HGVs. Slow moving traffic causes excessive pollution in a rural area, if it were a dual carriagweay there would be less emissions as cars would be runnning more efficiently. Also the number of times the road closed would be reduced if a breakdown occured as one lane could be left open.  The number of times I have seen Articulated lorries turned over on bends , straighten the road out and plough right through the hills speeding the traffic up to a safer speed. Clear all the dangerous trees away from the new roads by at least the height of the tallest tree from the roads ,otherwise more people will be killed by falling trees in high winds.\nThis is the second biggest arterial road into London after the M5/M4 and it needs to be dual carriageway.",
