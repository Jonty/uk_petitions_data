            "background": "On the afternoon of 21/7/06 Angus Campbell was travelling to his place of work on the Northern Line when an attempt was made of an act of terrorism.\n\nDespite his first urge to run from the carriage he was sitting in, his first concern was the safety of his fellow passengers in the carriage he was occupying.\n\nAfter evacuating the carriage Mr Campbell remaind in the carriage with total disregard for his safety attempting to contact the driver telling him to keep the doors closed, trapping himself with a suspected terrorist, whilst all the time trying to get the suspected terrorist to surrender.  When the train entered the Oval tube station the doors opened and again Mr Campbell did not hesitate in running after the suspected terrorist in an attempt to aprehend him.\n\nIn his actions Mr Campbell totally disregarded his own safety and acted to the highest standards, some would say beyond the call of duty.",
