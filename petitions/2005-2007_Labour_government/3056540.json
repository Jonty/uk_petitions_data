            "background": "Too many accidents occur every year with electrical equipment that could be avoided or reduced by a simple 5 minute safety check, which, although it is advised by health and safety guidelines, is not a legal requirement. I would go as far as to suggest compulsory home testing should also be carried out and form a part of the home and buildings insurance policies requirement. carelessness costs too many precious lives.",
