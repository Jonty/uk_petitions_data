As the person leading a party is a main consideration for voters, the party may not have the backing of the public when he leaves.\nAs Mr Brown has robbed us blind in stealth taxes, he does not seem popular and there does not appear to be anybody else capable of leading this country, in the party.\nThe only way to ensure that New Labour have the consent of the people has got to be an election.It does not seem democratic for the new Prime Minister to be chosen from within the ranks of New Labour.",
