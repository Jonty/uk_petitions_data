            "background": "I am a college student and there is a free bus that goes to my college but if i get on it, it will make me late for my lectures so therefore i would ask to allow all college students full time and part time free bus passes so that they will not end up being late and this can be used for travel thorughout the week as well.I get a megarider which lasts a week and it eats into my \u00a310 budget as it cost \u00a37.60. This will help them gain independance and would cost less for them to travel. I think many college students will be in favour of this.",
