            "action": "Bring England on a par with Scotland and stop Old and infirmed people selling their homes to pay for care, this should be their right after paying into the NHS all their lives.This does not apply to those who choose to go into sheltered accomodation",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Old people who are unable to take care of themselves for physical or mental health reasons are at present told the NHS will not care for them and are expected to sell the home they have worked and saved all their lives for to pay for care.In most cases it has taken a life time of hard work to buy a home where they can spend the rest of their days in familiar surroundings and expect to leave something for their children.It is morally wrong that those who choose to rent are given free care, yet those who make an effort to help themselves are penalised at a time when they need all the support they are entitled to.When an old person suffers with Cancer,Alzheimers etc. and hospitals can't do any more for them, does not mean they should not get free NHS care, especially for the old and infirmed,that is what the NHS was designed for.What is fair about the Scottish elderly given the respect they deserve whilst the elderly in England are treated like second class citizens?.",
