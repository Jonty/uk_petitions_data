With its harmonious attitude to all peoples, beliefs and respect of the natural world, surely it could provide a wonderful example to children?\nAt present there is no official line of inclusion for wicca, and it's time we proved we are over foolish superstitions and hollywood ideas of the craft and allow it due recognition.",
