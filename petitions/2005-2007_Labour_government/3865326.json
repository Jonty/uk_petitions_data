With more than 80% of UK graduates of 2006 being unemployed as physiotherapists, something has to be done.\n\nProvide better management of funding in order to put a stop to jobs freezes. These make career development almost impossible, and are causing major under-staffing which contributes hugely to large waiting lists, and additional pressure on staff.",
