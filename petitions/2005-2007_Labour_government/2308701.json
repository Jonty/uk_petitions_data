Motorists currently do not meet the full costs of their activities in terms of congestion and the additional polution of driving during peak - ie congested - hours.  Road pricing has a place as part of a range of policies aimed at reducing road usage.  These must include better and lower cost public transport, but road pricing should also be explored PROVIDING it can be achieved without reducing personal privacy and that revenues raised are added to existing funds in support of public transport, not just another tax for the Treasury.",
