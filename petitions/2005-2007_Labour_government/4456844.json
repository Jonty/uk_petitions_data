ALL THE MONEY SPENT ON SAFETY EQUIPMENT (CAMERAS ETC)IS WASTED IF YOU DONT BOTHER WITH CHECKING THE SAFETY OF THE VEHCLES ON THE ROAD.\nTHE CURENT MOT TEST IS SUPPOSED TO GUARANTEE THE SAFETY OF A VEHICLE FOR THREE MONTHS- IN WHICH CASE YOU HAVE 9 MONTHS OF THE YEAR WHEN EVERY VEHCLE ON THE ROAD CAN BE A DANGER TO THE DRIVER & OTHER ROAD USERS.\nI HAVE VEHICLES THAT DO TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND MILES PER YEAR, YOUR PLANS WOULD MEAN THAT THEY WILL DO HALF A MILLION MILES WITHOUT A SAFETY CHECK. HOW IS THIS PROGRESS?",
