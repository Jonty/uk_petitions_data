            "action": "Abolish VAT on the installation and operation of private sewage treatment and disposal equipment serving domestic premises.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I wish to remove this anomaly where people not connected to mains drainage are charged VAT for installing new, environmentally friendly, packaged sewage treatment equipment, and servicing it, whereas people connected to mains drainage are not liable for any VAT. The cost of installing the equipment is very high, without the additional burden of VAT, and the owners do not escape ongoing payments. Although they do not pay sewage charges, they are obliged by the Environment Agency to keep the equipment maintained by a competent engineer, and also have the equipment de-sludged annually by road tanker. In many cases the expense of installing modern sewage equipment is too great, so outdated equipment continues to pour raw sewage into streams and watercourses. The Environment Agency rarely act to prevent this, as staff shortages do not allow regular inspections of all domestic installations. If allowed, this petition will reward the responsible people who care for the environment by installing new, modern equipment, but the reduced cost will also encourage others to follow.",
