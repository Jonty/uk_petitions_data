            "background": "There are a disproportionate number of lawyers in Parliament. Lawyers have a certain way of looking at the world, which oftens lacks proportion or common sense. Parliamentarians also draft poor or bad legislation, so that their colleagues in practice can then make a fortune in the subsequent confusion created. The number of lawyers should be limited to a certain percentage, say 5%. Parliament belongs to the people, not the Law Society. This is democracy, fair representation of society as a whole, not a priviledged section of the population.",
