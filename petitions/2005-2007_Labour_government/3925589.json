            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The growth of the Internet has created a \"secondary market\" allowing ticket touts to easily buy up tickets for concerts and other events without even leaving their houses. Due to these companies and individuals, tickets are sold out within minutes of concert tickets going on sale. They then turn up on their own websites at huge markup prices, sometimes up to five times face value. The situation has escalated so far out of control that these tickets are sometimes available for purchase even before they have gone on sale officially.\n\nWe the undersigned believe that the law desperately needs to be changed to protect not only the individual who wishes to purchase tickets from official sources, but also the artists and official ticket vendors whose jobs are made impossibly difficult by these people.\n\nIt should be perfectly acceptable for ticket holders to be able to sell their own tickets to other individuals online or otherwise, since there are times when people are unavoidably unable to attend a planned event. However we believe it should be made illegal for any unofficial ticket reseller to make a profit from any ticket sales.",
