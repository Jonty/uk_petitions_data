            "background": "Over recent years much attention has been paid to young inexperienced   drivers & speeding motorists who cause accidents, and quite rightly so. However I am petitioning the Prime Minister because I and many others feel that there is another great danger on the roads, Elderly Drivers. Many of them are not physically and mentally up to the task of controlling a vehicle on the road. Also they have not been tested on their driving abilities recently and so are not too current standards. Therefore I believe a retest at the age of 65 is needed to remove those elderly drivers from the road which are a danger to themselves and other road users.",
