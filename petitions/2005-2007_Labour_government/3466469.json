There is a huge shortage of prison space and the Falkands, a Crown posession, would be an ideal place to send long term and repeat offenders. There people can develop the region and make it economically viable for the UK to hold. The outposting of troops on the island means that it is clearly viable already to hold prisoners there. Using this we could not only solve the prisons issue, but massively improve the economy of the Falklands. QED",
