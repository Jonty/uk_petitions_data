            "background": "Customary units of measurement (miles, feet, inches, pounds, ounces, stone, acres, pints, quarts, gallons, etc.), sometimes referred to as imperial units, are part of our heritage and culture. They are in wide use by all ages. They are also used formally and widely by one of our major trading partners and informally or in certain sectors by many others. They must be taught in tandem with metric units and with equal emphasis to metric units throughout the schooling process.",
