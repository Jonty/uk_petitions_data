            "background": "Raise Inheritance tax to 90%.\nPay the proceeds into care for the elderly, which is seriouly underfunded at present.\n\nMoney has often been described as the root of evil, but we disagree. What we observe is that enormous evil is created by squabbling over inheritance.\nGreed, jealousy,lies and often murder ensue. Sometimes family members begin life long feuds when a wealthy person dies.\nMuch better to have a 90% tax to encourage  old people to give it away if they want to. The money should not go directly to the government but to a new charity to use the money ethically.",
