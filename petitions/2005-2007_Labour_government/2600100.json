If the age of the individual is unknown, or the crime is greater than theft, the individual should be held responsible for their actions.\nFor example a murderer is a murderer, regardless of age.\nI can think back to many murders that have been committed by those considered 'Under-age' to be tried properly, they get their names changed and their education paid for, this is ridiculous.\nLets make ALL criminals pay!",
