This pioneering EMI (Elderly Mentally Infirmed) Day Centre is due to be closed in March 2009 under Staffordshire County Council\u2019s Health & Social Care Strategy \u201cChanging Lives Programme\u201d. Dementia, a progressive brain dysfunction, leads to a gradually increasing restriction of daily activities. The most well-known type of dementia is Alzheimer's disease. Dementia not only affects patients, but also those surrounding them, as most patients require care in the long-term.  The service and the respite that May Place gives to both suffers and the carer is second to none, the \u201cChanging Lives Programme\u201d offers no suitable alternative to this excellent service, and was excluded from the consultation process\u2026Please support this petition to save May Place.",
