        "background": "It seems now that we will not even be able to have a choice in what light bulbs we use, with the spurious claim it will help the environment. There is real evidence, based on genuine science as opposed to fear-inducing politics, that as Co2 constitutes just 0.054 parts of the atmosphere, that it cannot possibly drive climate change, and never has.\nTo save this energy, we must probably forsake the dimmer switch and use far more energy to replace millions of light fittings that were never designed for these bulbs. Sparked by another intrusive EU directive, this makes no sense at all. Sign for personal choice now.",
