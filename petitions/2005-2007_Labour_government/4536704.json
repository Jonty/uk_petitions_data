        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A nationally supported educational structure that raises environmental and sustainable awareness, would get all of our children on the right, green track before they step into adult life.\n\nElements should include:- how to compost, seasonal cooking from fresh (which should never have left the curriculum), basic fruit and vegetable cultivation, what's in our hedgerows, better interaction via a revival of non-electric games, natural cleaning without chemicals, balancing your cheque book/living within your means, simple renewable energy and promotion of volunteering in our communities, amongst others.\n\nChildren are the leaders of the future and would benefit from proper 'life-lessons' offering real guidance - let's take the 'freaky out of eco' by normalising and encouraging sustainable behaviour and lifestyles.",
