        "background": "Le Manh Luong, 46, from South London has been on death row since 25 November 2006, after being convicted of drug trafficking. Brain damaged from a B52 American bomber during the Vietnam War, he would, if executed, become the first Briton to be executed outside the USA during Prime Minister Blair\u2019s premiership. \n\nAll of Mr Luong\u2019s legal appeals have failed, despite medical evidence showing he suffers from a mental disorder as a result of the injury he sustained during the war. His hopes now lie with a clemency petition that will be considered by President Nguyen Minh Triet. If that is unsuccessful, he will be executed by firing squad.\n\nIn cases of Australian nationals on death row in Vietnam, their death sentences have been commuted subsequent to intervention by Australian Prime Minister John Howard speaking personally to the Vietnamese President. We are petitioning Prime Minister Blair to do the same.\n\nIt is vital that the Prime Minister personally intervene and do everything in his power to ensure that Mr Luong is not executed.",
