        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "By abolishing National Insurance and Tax Credits and using a single taxation system with a reasonable threshold so lower paid people do not have to claim top up benefits to reclaim taxes that the state have already taken. \nAmalgamate benefits instead of the vast number that all have differing rules and legislation, thereby causing waste and confusion.\nReduce the VAT on bio-fuel and green solutions such as solar and wind. Using higher VAT on luxury and enviromentally damging goods and services such as air travel to tax consumption rather than work. \nTo abolish the need for Road Tax and Road Pricing when oil companies have a system of collecting revenue, which is easier, cheaper and impossible to avoid (even for visiting foreign lorries)",
