            "action": "review the new rolling-stock purchasing arrangements on the rail network between the Train Operating Companies and the Rolling Stock Leasing Companies to encourage new builds and relieve some of the risk on the ROSCOs to drive down leasing costs.",

            "background": "The current arrangement relies on the ROSCOs taking all of the risk (by buying the trains themselves) and therefore detracts from the building of new train fleets and encourages very high leasing costs, therefore forcing subsidy-paying TOCs to lease a minimum number of trains or substandard trains, which impacts public service provision.",
