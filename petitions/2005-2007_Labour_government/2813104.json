        "background": "It 'IS' against the law to not pay maintenance, yet there is no law in place to make parents pay...\n\nThis is a contradiction in terms and this needs dealing with, with immediate effect to ensure that 'children' receive maintenance in order for them to not fall into the poverty trap hence enabling single parents to return to work.  This is the sort of enforement this country needs to 'GET TOUGH WITH ABSENT PARENTS' by NOT allowing huge debts to accumulate and spiral out of control....these children need this money NOW not when they are in there 20's.",
