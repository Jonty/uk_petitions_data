            "background": "With the oncoming smoking ban due to commence in 2007, Bingo players who smoke will no longer be able to smoke whilst they play the game. Playing Bingo and its members want to see permission for ventilated smoking areas to be set aside in Bingo Halls across the UK once the ban is in place, rather than force players to miss out due to their smoking habits.",
