            "background": "This tax would be unfair and unworkable.\n\n1. Householders already pay tax to have their waste removed.\n\n2. The problem of litter and flytipping would become an unmanageable health hazard.\n\n3. Householders would have to lock their bins to stop unscrupulous neighbours\nfilling it up with their waste, and bin-men would need the key, adding hours to the bin round.\n(Unless of course the government intends to prosecute innocent householders.)\n\n4. The Government would be better placed putting their energies towards reducing unnecessary packaging, junk mail and other causes of waste, together with a push towards bio-degradable packaging where possible.\n\n5. This appears to be nothing more than another excuse to tax us again.",
