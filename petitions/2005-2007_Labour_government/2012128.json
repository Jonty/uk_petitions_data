        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As a disabled person who lives alone and who worked  for Leonard Cheshire, I saw that disabled people in residential care had more \"independence\" and community involvement than me. I'd get let down by care agencies or have staff who would turn up hours late, thinking it was \"an office joke\". That isn't \"independence\". Employing a PA is a paperwork mountain and was too much to deal with and a f/t job. When I spent 6 months in residential care, I had more independence, never missed work, and could work late, knowing I'd get food and care when I got home. That furthered my independence, career prospects and self esteem, but left me financially broke as I had to pay a lot. I worked f/t & was left with \u00a340 p/w. I have 2 degrees so got sick of it. \n\nPlease see residential care as being \"in the community\", promoting independence.  It shouldn't be looked down upon as many disability groups do, when they often don't have the personal experience to criticise residential care.",
