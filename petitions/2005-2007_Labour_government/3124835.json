            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many urban single and dual carriageways carry round-the-clock traffic past people's front doors at speeds up to 70mph.  These speed limits were mainly imposed in the early 1970's, when traffic flows, especially late at night, were much lower than present levels.\n\nHigh speed driving in areas populated by families, with pets and children, increases the rate of fatal accidents; produces higher levels of illness and premature death due to dangerous air pollution; and increases stress-inducing noise pollution, especially at night when people are trying to sleep.\n\nAs urban conditions have changed dramatically in recent years, the quality of life of residents of congested urban housing areas should be re-balanced against the convenience of passing drivers.\n\nReducing the speed limit to a maximum of 40mph in UK urban residential areas would dramatically increase the quality of life of residents without undue inconvenience to motorists.",
