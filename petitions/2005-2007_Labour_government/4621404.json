            "background": "As an alternative to existing dispute resolution mechanisms, dueling should be legalised as a way for consenting adults to resolve disputes. \n\nThe proposal is that dueling be leaglised, with certain safeguards in place, as a recognised means of settling any criminal or civil dispute. \n\nIt is envisaged that there would be government regulated dueling centers established in every county in the UK which would prevent abuse of the process to facilitate murder. Such centers could also negotiate the use of swords or pistols, and could make the latter available for hire.\n\nThis proposal, if implemented, would save a huge amount of money and time as it would shift expensive litigation currently carried out through the court system to one Agency. Furthermore, the outcome of any duel would be definitive and negate any expensive enforcement action following the outcome of a traditional trial.\n\nIf implemented it will also being back respect and a sense of honour into society.",
