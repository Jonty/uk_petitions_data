            "background": "The Court for the Arbitration of Sport has recommended that the Gibraltar Football Association should be admitted to UEFA on a provisional basis.\n\nHowever the Spanish Football Federation continues to block the move with the support of the Spanish Government. In 2001, Spain convinced UEFA to adopt a new rule stipulating that only countries recognised by the United Nations as independent states could become members.\n\nSpain claims sovereignty over Gibraltar, which was ceded to Britain in perpetuity under the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht. The court said the Gibraltar FA should be granted member status before the UEFA Congress in D\u00fcsseldorf on January 25/26, 2007. It should have been granted at UEFA's executive meeting on October 4/5; Spain however managed to prolong UEFA's decision by arguing that Gibraltar's National Stadium is on disputed territory, a argument that has no political let alone sporting basis.",
