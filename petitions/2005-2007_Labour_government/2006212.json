        "background": "Currently local government administrations are legally allowed to extract money from the electorate but are not accountable to them in how it is spent, for example how department budgets are spent. There would be greater participation in local democracy and control over council tax bills if the unelected administration bodies were made to account to a locally elected group of lay people to explain their decisions. The elected group being able to enforce pre-approval for budgets if they were not satisfied with how decisions were being reached. Currently the processes such a objections raised to published notices in newspapers are routinely ignored, making a mockery of democracy.",
