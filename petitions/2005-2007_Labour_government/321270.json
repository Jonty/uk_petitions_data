            "background": "Why should faith schools be banned when they have been working dor hundreads of years often getting some of the best results in the country because of higher discepline. It is false to believe that these schools just teach creationalism. I myself am in my final year at a catholic 6 form in brentford and have both been taught the religious view, the scientific view among studyion other religios throughout my education. I also recieve General RE lessons which tackles issues facing teenagers and adults in this day and age. Why take away the identity of schools which are doing so well. There is also integration in my school between different faiths and many cultures from West African to Polish to Filipino to West Indian there are many many different cultures and so does not encourage social discriminaltion.",
