        "background": "1) Ordering the development of a new tank type, as the current version's armour is too weak against explosives used by the Al-Qaeda, the Taleban and the Iraqi insurgents. Please name it Asquith, after Prime Minister Asquith, who was a good wartime leader, and should be honoured by naming a tank type after him just like Churchill was.\n2) Ordering that the FV430 becomes the sole IFV/APC type used by the British Army, as it is lighter and faster than other vehicles currently used by the BA. There are 15 variants of the FV430, each designed for a different role, and these 15 variants would all perform their roles better than any other British or non-British armoured vehicles. Please also cancel the MRAV project.\n3) Reverse your manpower cuts.\n4) The SA80L85A2 5.45mm assault rifle should be replaced by the American M14 7.62mm rifle. It's a Vietnam war era gun, but the US military has began using it again, because American soldiers think it is a good weapon.",
