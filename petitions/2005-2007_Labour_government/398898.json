We believe that, contrary to the assertions of Suffolk County Council, middle schools work well and provide a unique environment which supports not just the educational but also the emotional and social well being of our children. \nIn the absence of any cogent case for change from the County Council, we would urge the Prime Minister to persuade Suffolk County Council to reconsider their proposals and to retain the middle school system in the county.",
