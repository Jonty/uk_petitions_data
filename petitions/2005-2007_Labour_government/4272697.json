            "background": "Britain long ago adopted the metric system in principle and taught it in schools. However, as a popularist measure, successive governments have failed to fully implement the change. This has left the country with a confused mixed system where few (younger) people can remember how many yards there are in a mile or how many pounds in a stone. It is surely time to move on.",
