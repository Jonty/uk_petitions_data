        "action": "Fully adopt the metric system of measurements. Miles should be replaced by kilometres, pints by litres and pounds by kilograms to provide a consistent and rational system that would also make trade with most of the world easier.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Britain long ago adopted the metric system in principle and taught it in schools. However, as a popularist measure, successive governments have failed to fully implement the change. This has left the country with a confused mixed system where few (younger) people can remember how many yards there are in a mile or how many pounds in a stone. It is surely time to move on.",
