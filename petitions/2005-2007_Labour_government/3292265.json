His latest out of hand rejection of the petition calling upon him to scrap the road pricing plans underlines his lack of concern for the opinions of the general public.\nThis is a major issue for the majority of people in the UK and the government should be actively supporting major research into less/non polluting forms of transport not making it too expensive for the masses to enjoy personal travel.\nThe people of Britain have suffered enough at the hands of this government and this \u201cPetition facility\u201d is a demonstration of the disdain with which the public are treated.\nTony Blair or his cabinet colleagues have no intention of allowing the opinions of the signatories to influence their thinking because in their opinion \u201cThey know best\u201d.\nSo come on Mr Blair, admit it, THIS SITE IS A SHAM!",
