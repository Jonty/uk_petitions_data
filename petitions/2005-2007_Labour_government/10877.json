We hear a lot about harm to society, harm to morals, harm to women and similar. But never about harm to individual liberty or harm caused by sexual repression.\n\nIf Ofcom have access to clear and reliable evidence that televised pornography would cause disproportionate harm, then this evidence should be presented to the public in the name of transparent regulation. If there is no such evidence then censorship of consensual adult pornography is a violation of the right to free expression and should cease immediately.",
