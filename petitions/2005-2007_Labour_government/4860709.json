Without their Families Knowledge let alone Permision.\nAnd this, all in the name of road safety! He continually destroys relations with the public, and the tourist industry alone is suffering desperately due to his Over Zealous use of Speed Camera Tactics.\nContinually in the press for his actions and policies which are generally regarded as inapropriate, and ludicrous. \nFor the victims of his indiscretion and tactless behavour I ask for this man to be removed from duty!",
