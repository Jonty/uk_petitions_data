            "background": "There seems to be discrimination towards the Black majority led churches that have nowhere to worship. This is due to a lack of suitable premises being available for non denominational Christian churches. The local authority is not flexible in granting permission for the change of use for commercial premises which some times would be more appropriate for a place of worship for the black community. This is because of their large and growing congregations, parking facilities and their unique style of worship. One of the reasons why local churches are not suitable is that they are not large enough or are just not available. Other religious community groups however e.g. Muslims are able to build a church or rent buildings but to my knowledge the Christian community are refused- this in my opinion is discrimination. This country is founded on Christian principles and he himself is a Christian. There are various issues for the black community what with Gun crime etc\u2026 which need to be addressed by providing the right kind of environment to tackle these situations; after all we are a Christian country! The Prime Minister in my opinion needs to consider this discrimination.",
