            "background": "The government is coming under heavy scrutiny over current and proposed \"green taxes\". Their is no doubt in the majority of individuals, companies and organisations that something has to be done to cut carbon and other related green house emmissions. A government regulated body should be set up and funded by theses co's, to research companies carbon costs and charge accordingly with every penny spent on the environment. This way the electorate could be assured that all costs were nominal, and any related costs passed on to the customer. We must not allow untransparrent, unlawful and expensive taxes which masquerade as a positive and environmental initiative.",
