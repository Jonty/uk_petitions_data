I am not implying that lower prices would encourage people not to drink drive but it may encourage people to drink non-alcoholic beverages as well as their alcohol.\n\nWe are advised to have non-alcoholic drinks in between alcoholic drinks but when this will double the cost of a night out is the average drinker really going to follow this advice? \n\nHow many of us have been thirsty at a bar but told we cannot have a glass of tap water without being charged for it - do we really have to drink from bathroom taps in order to control dehydration and avoid become too inebriated?\n\nSoft drinks should have a controlled mark up limit in pubs so that we can all reduce the effects of binge drinking in the UK.",
