            "background": "More and more special schools nationwide are being closed and this is detrimental to the special needs child/student. This also forces many SEN children back into the mainstream school setting where it is impossible for them to thrive and cope with the surroundings.  Many SEN children who have special needs cannot function within mainstream school settings which has effects of them not achieving  to the best of their ability. If many more schools close I dread to think of the state of SEN children in years to come. Their childhood education is so very important so please lets not take away what chance they have in making it a better quality of life for them, later in life.",
