        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "You can now buy gas and electricity from any supplier and this has meant lower bills for consumers. However, you can only buy water from your local water company and have no choice of supplier, so no competition and thus higher prices than if the market was opened up.\n\nWith some water suppliers, in the south especially, unable to meet demand in summer periods, the government should look at how a national water network could be created along the lines of the national grid.\n\nBeing able to sell excess water to less water rich areas would bring in money for those areas selling water and provide relief to those suffering from lack of it.\n\nHaving a national water grid would allow competition in the water market in the same way as we have with both electricity and gas.",
