        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Car insurance at the moment, especially for under 25's is phenomonally high! It is therfore cheaper for many people to not insure their vehicles, and accept existing fines and sanctions in the unlikely event that they are caught, than it is to get insurance! \nI propose that the sanctions for not having Insurance should greatly outweigh the cost of getting insurance!! For example, automatic seizure and crushing of uninsured vehicles, followed by a hefty fine and loss of license for 12 months, followed by a re-take of the driving test for offenders who are caught without insurance. Offenders who drive uninsured and subsequently cause an accident should face all of the above plus an automatic jail term reflecting the seriousness of the accident. These measures would make many insurance dodgers, or potential insurance dodgers think twice(and hopefully get insured) Whereas at the moment, many simply dont care if they get caught!!",
