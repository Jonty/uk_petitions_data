        "background": "There are generally three types of people that do not vote at a general election.\n\nThose who don't understand politics, those who don't like politics and those who do take an interest in politics, but feel they are not represented by any of the candidates or parties on offer.\n\nAll three of the above groups are lumped together as \"apathetic non voters\".\n\nTo give the disenfranchised would-be voters a voice, putting the phrase \"None Of The Above\" directly underneath the names on the ballot form would allow us all to excercise our constitutional right on polling day, and provide a more accurate assessment of why so many of the electorate don't vote.\n\nA bonus for Mr Brown is that this would not cost anything in administration costs.",
