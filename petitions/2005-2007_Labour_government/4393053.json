        "background": "Concerts by high-profile artists such as the Rolling Stones or U2 usually sell out within minutes. Many tickets are purchased by people living in other countries. One is example is many Americans purchasing tickets for the Rolling Stones' (intimate by their standards) two concerts at the O2 Arena in London. The Americans get MANY more concerts by the Rolling Stones than we do in the UK. It's therefore reasonable to make it illegal for people from other countries to buy tickets for UK concerts that experience high demand for tickets, so that more British people can get to see their favourite bands.",
