            "background": "The British Council has announced funding cuts in European countries of 30% over the next two years. 15 British Council offices will close - in Finland, Hungary, Slovenia, Austria, Bulgaria, Germany, Slovakia, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia - reducing the council\u2019s presence in Europe from 19 countries to 9. \nWe, the undersigned, demand continued investment in the British Council\u2019s 'public face' in European countries. The Council has an illustrious history, reaching out in the best possible way to our fellow Europeans - culturally, creatively and educationally. It also plays a vital role in English language teaching across the continent and encourages scientific research exchanges that bring talented young people from Europe into contact with the best Britain has to offer. \nAt a time when the European Union is expanding like never before, investing in peaceful, cultural diplomacy is vital to ensuring Britain's prestige and cultural resonance in Europe. Let's keep these offices open!",
