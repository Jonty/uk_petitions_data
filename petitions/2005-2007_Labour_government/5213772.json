            "background": "If you are lucky enough to have Private Medical Insurance via your employer - almost essential given the state of the health service - why should you get taxed MORE for having it when invariably you end up using the NHS less!  You become less of a burden on the taxpayer and - if you have PMI - it is likely you pay higher tax and NI contributions than most people anyway.  \n\nWe should NOT have to pay more for less.  \n\nIt should instead be used as an excellent tool for encouraging employers to offer this benefit to staff with the net result being less people receiving free NHS treatment and therefore an increase spend per person for the remaining NHS users.  EVERYBODY WINS - even the Chancellor since s/he could actually afford to spend less on the NHS if desired and / or make the money that is there go around further.",
