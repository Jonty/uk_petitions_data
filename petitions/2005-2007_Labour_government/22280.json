            "background": "I strongly suggest that the democratic forum of the internet and networked entertainment media are used to gather accurate representations of what the British public actually feel about current affairs. Using the 'Red Button' people will be asked what they think about any particular topic, and are able to cast their vote. This provides a fair opinion poll on virtually any topic, and should provide links to several corporate and independent news media sources to avoid private organisations influencing the final outcome too strongly.",
