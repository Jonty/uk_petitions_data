        "background": "The process to convert the UK to metric road signs was halted in 1970. Surely it is time for the UK Government to catch up with others, by completing the conversion to metric which this country started as long as forty years ago.  Britain is educating a second generation of children with the \neasy-to-calculate metric system, but preventing them from using it outside school. Roads and road signs are designed in metric, but imperial measures must be used on the signage. Consumers are regularly confused by the continued use of two incompatible systems.",
