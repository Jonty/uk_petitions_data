            "background": "Ken Livingstone is planning too allow the biggest landmark in London, bigger than St Paul's, Westminster Abbey or even Wembley Stadium to be a Mosque. 100 million is an outrage to spend on a religious building when there is homeless, poverty and lack of funds for doctors.  If there was to be a religious building at the site of the Olympics then it should be a Bahai Temple of UNITY where all faiths can worship together.  I follow the view of Jesus that all prayer should be done in private and alone, he was against public displays of worship and also against reciting scripture.",
