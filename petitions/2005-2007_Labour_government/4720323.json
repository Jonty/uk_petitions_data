        "background": "Manchester United and Chelsea Football Clubs have each been allocated around 25,000 tickets for the FA Cup Final between the two clubs on May 19th, against a capacity of 90,000 at the new Wembley Stadium. This is a ridiculously small number, given that Manchester United have a ground capacity of around 76000 and Chelsea around 42000, leading to very many genuine football fans being disappointed on the day of the Cup Final.",
