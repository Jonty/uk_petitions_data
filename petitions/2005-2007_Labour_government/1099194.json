        "background": "RiDE magazine is asking the government to make the sale of motorcycle frames and V5 documents illegal, as the majority are used for:\n\na) Rebuilding written-off machines\nb) A home for stolen parts\nc) Insurance fraud\n\nMany frames are sold with an MOT, tax and some even have service history. Others are used as an false identity for many stolen parts, while some frames are insured for fraudulent insurance claims.\n\nThe number of frame and log book sales for genuine, legal purposes is so small RiDE suggests it should be made illegal altogether.",
