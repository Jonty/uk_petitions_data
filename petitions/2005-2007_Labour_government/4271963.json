On their own scoring system, the responses determined that there was a need for this information.  The score put the subject in the highest band of areas to be included.  However, ONS have decided not to include such questions as they are concerned that it will affect return rates.  They have also said that they have concerns about the \u2018acceptability\u2019 of such questions.\n\nOn the first point, there is already evidence in Scotland that including sexuality related questions did not adversely affect responses to their survey.\n\nOn the second point, consideration would obviously need to be given to the wording of the questions, but they should not be excluded just because some may not like them.  An option to say \u2018would rather not say\u2019 should be enough.\n\nThe Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender people of this country do not find the attitude of ONS acceptable.  We refuse to wait until 2021 to be counted and acknowledged.",
