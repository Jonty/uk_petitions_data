            "background": "Britain is a society that is now collapsing on itself. It is litered with anti-social behaviour and drink thug culture which cannot be dealt with if the affairs stay the way they are. Police are subjected to assaults, violence and threats every day. You only have to walk through London as a police officer to see people making gun guestures at them, and any british town on a friday saturday night is a haven for thugs and violence. I propose the police and criminal evidence act and the human rights act be revamped to allow justice to be served effectively, and the police be allowed to do their job efficiently and demand the respect they deserve. If people want to be safe, the police have to be able to do their jobs without all the red tape and fear of reprisals, suspensions whilst claims of brutality and unfair actions are made by the offenders or people who live outside the REAL world without knowing the full facts. The police need the authority to carry out their responcibility. And I ask the government do this to allow Britain to save itself before it falls and these years are remembered as our biggest mistakes.",
