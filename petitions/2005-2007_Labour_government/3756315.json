            "background": "To paraphrase a famous saying \u2018never in human history have so few,cost so many,so much\u2019. We are now 7 years into the 21st Century and with today's technology we should be living in a Utopia. 95% of us are probably law abiding and honest yet we\u2019re intimidated by 5% who are not. When the police put in enough resources they are capable of solving almost every crime,but crime continues. Why? Because criminals have no respect for the law and are not afraid of getting caught.They know that the advantages from crime outweigh any punishment.We waste billions combating crime and we should be spending this on more important issues.We call on the Government to change their priorities and make protecting the honest 95% their 1st priority and pontificating about the causes of crime,no matter how noble this is,their 2nd priority. All crime, apart from that committed by the mentally unstable, could be eliminated if the deterrent was severe enough.The Government must introduce these deterrents.",
