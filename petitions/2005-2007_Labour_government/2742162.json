            "background": "The decision to make company vehicles NO smoking DOMAINS when the anti-smoking law becomes active is quite frankly.... ludicrous. I feel it is a breach of my human rights, and most of all quite clearly dangerous, and has not been given thought to the fact, that when drivers/people smoke in cars, it is both relaxing and calming. Will the ban not create more road rage, as people become needy for there cigarettes. Will it not create drivers/people falling asleep at the wheel, where normally they would smoke and stay alert in there driving.\nWhen the money being spent totalling over \u00a326million on inforcement officers for local councils could be spent on MORE POLICE.., SCHOOLS.., TACKLING CRIME.., HOSPITALS.., RE-OPENING THE HUNDREDS OF SHUT POLICE STATIONS.. THE LIST GOES ON....",
