The United Kingdom and the relevent part of the title United Kingdom is \"Kingdom\" means we are subjects and not citizens. To be a citizen you have to live in a country such as for example France which is of course a Republic, so Prime Minister and future Prime Ministers in case you are not aware of this fact please take notice. \n\nRegards\n\nChris Duckett",
