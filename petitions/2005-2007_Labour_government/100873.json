If we are at war, the public should know the full details and so demand the following questions be properly addressed through an independent inquiry:\n\n- What is the UK definition of the \u2018war on terror\u2019?\n- Is \u2018terror\u2019 a legitimate military objective?\n- What are the causes of terrorism?\n- Can terrorism be successfully combated with traditional military means?\n- What progress are we making in the \u2018war on terror\u2019?\n- Why is there no internationally agreed definition of \u2018terrorism\u2019?\n\nWe, the undersigned, believe that such basic questions have never been answered satisfactorily, or at all. This should be a pre-requisite, rather than an afterthought, to war.",
