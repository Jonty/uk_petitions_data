        "background": "As car drivers are allowed to wear sunglasses whilst driving in sunny conditions, motorcyclists are prohibited from having tinted visors that exceed that of 50% or 'Dark'. The advice given is to wear sunglasses instead, this being highly dangerous whilst riding as it means temporarily riding one-handed to remove them should light conditions detereorate, whereas a dark visor can be opened.\nIn the same way car drivers won't drive at night wearing sunglasses, bikers are by far sensible enough not to use their dark visors in limited visibilty or evening conditions, knowing that they are already in a 'high-risk' accident category already.",
