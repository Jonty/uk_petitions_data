        "background": "I have just watched with mixed horror and pride the 2007 comic relief program, horror at the poverty that remains in this world , and pride in our country and the way it can pull together for a common cause. Normally i am blown away by the sums of money raised by this event as it reaches beyond the hundreds of millions of pounds, but this year one figure just kept appearing in my head... NINE BILLION POUNDS,the estimated cost of the Olympic games!\nAnt and Dec show a toilet block in Africa that costs only 90 pounds to build... i see 9 BILLION POUNDS available , i see a batterd wife talk to Davina all i can think of is the 9 BILLION POUNDS that we have to spend. \nThe games were estimated to cost a staggering 3.5 billion but this cost has risen to a mind boggling 9 billion pounds, how on earth is this justifiable? \nAnt and Dec blushed trying to explain that no one in our country slept on the floor , imagine trying to explain that as a nation we are going to spend 9 BILLION pounds on the games ,and if we have 9 billion to spend why do we have nhs budgets? and why does Africa suffer. Sign this petiton if you feel that the 9 Billion pounds olympics budget should be given to the NHS and comic relief. thanks.",
