            "background": "Without VAT costs in the calculation, it can cost less to repair an historic building than to rebuild it.  But this becomes uneconomic when VAT is factored in, because the repair will incur VAT while demolition of the building and rebuilding it does not incur VAT.  Fiscal policy is encouraging the destruction of well loved and historic buildings and encouraging their replacement with inferior and often shoddy new builds.  This is not only culturally destructive but costly in both money and in other resources.",
