            "background": "As it currently stands it is not possible to apply for a student loan for a second degree if you have already taken one out for a previous degree. This is money that will be repaid by the individual as it is not a grant.\n\nAs it stands somebody wishing to do a second degree faces paying full fees (up to \u00a312,000 for a three-year course) as well as pay for all other living expenses. As most people choosing to undertake a second degree are not reliant on parental assistance as perhaps with a first degree, it makes the paying of fees upfront and paying for housing, food and bills very difficult and cost prohibitive.\n\nAllowing citizens to better themselves and broaden their knowledge and skills base will benefit the diversity of the economy. As stated this is money that will be repaid by the individual as it is a loan not a grant.",
