            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The nuclear industry claims that nuclear power is a totally safe form of energy generation and that it will reduce CO2 emissions. If so and given that London is a primary comsumer of power in the UK, then the former Battersea power station site should be developed into a nuclear power plant with no threat to the local population and the Houses of Parliament. It would also reduce the need for power lines running across the countryside and excess heat from the station could be given to surrounding houses for free instead of dumping heat into the sea. Planning permission would be no problem as no change of use would result. This would then be (depending on the safety record & feedback from all neighbours) the flagship for more nuclear power stations to be built in the UK and truely test the claims made by the nuclear industry. All pro-nuclear politicians would then have a vested interest in actually investigating whether nuclear power is the best & safest solution.",
