            "background": "The government and its band of government-paid scientists insist that Carbon Dioxide emissions from motorists, travellers and industry are causing climate change.\n\nThe science FACT is that carbon dioxide emissions are NOT in ANY WAY a contributing factor that drives climate change. The scientific evidence of today and over the past 100's of years of data shows clearly that CO2 does not cause a change in climte.\nThe science clearly shows the cause of climate change to solely rest with our Sun.\n\nThis petition is to bring to the attention of our government that CO2 emmisions and the resultant list of taxations that follows it is totally UNJUSTIFIED and that the constant claims that CO2 is causing climate change to stop being publicised as though it were fact.",
