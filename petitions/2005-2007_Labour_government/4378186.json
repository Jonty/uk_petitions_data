With over 70,000 (&believed by some to be 100,000) new diagnoses a year, skin cancer is currently the fastest growing form of cancer and treating it is estimated to cost the NHS in excess of \u00a371 million per annum. This is a disgrace considering that skin cancer is also one of the most preventable forms of cancer.",
