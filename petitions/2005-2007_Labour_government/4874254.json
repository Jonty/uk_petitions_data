            "background": "There are far too many young children who are addicted to drugs. In order to help prevent more teenagers from starting to use drugs, I believe that more police officers should be put on patrol around High Schools and should be prepared and willing to make arrests. I think that the only way to stop increasing drug addiction (though quite extereme), is to arrest any teenagers to be seen in possession of drugs. This should be part of a large national campaign to combat drug addiction.",
