Just yesterday I reported a problem to one undisclosed company (which they didn't have an answer for) and ended up staying on the phone for 30 minutes (Which they will later charge me alot for). This petition will ensure that customers will not have to pay a penny for the call if the company cannot solve your problem. This way, if the company decides to waste time and put you on hold you can put the phone down at any given time safe in the mind that if you haven't been given a helpful answer, then you won't have to pay for the call.",
