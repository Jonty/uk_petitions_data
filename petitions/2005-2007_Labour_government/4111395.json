        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There bas been much publicity of late regarding the ban on using mobile phones when driving and the recent enhanced penalties including 3 points for driving whilst using a phone. Driving whilst smoking presents a similar set of risks:\n1. Distraction (dropped ash in vehicle, looking down at ash tray)\n2. Hand occupied doing activity non essential to driving a car\n\nMoreover regular driving and smoking cause film deposits on the windshield which increase glare at dusk, reducing visibility. \n\nThese factors, coupled with the fact that smokers as a group are happier taking risks than the general population has resulted in cheaper car insurance for non smokers in Canada. We should thus recognise the risk that smoking and driving causes, place it on a par with using a mobile phone and ban it.",
