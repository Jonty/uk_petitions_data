            "background": "Hemp has many uses that can be implimented in this world and all are benificial.\n\nThere are many sources for information on this many available on the internet.\n\nBIOMASS CONVERSION to fuel has proven economically feasible, first in laboratory tests and by continuous operation of pilot plants in field tests since 1973. When the energy crop is growing it takes in C02 from the air, so when it is burned the C02 is released, creating a balanced system.\n\nScientists have been ignoring hemp for years when conducting experiements to find a way of creating fuel most suffiencently from biomass.\n\nIn July 2005, Cornell University published a study saying that it is not economical to produce ethanol or biodiesel from corn and other crops. The vegetable sources that are currently (legally) available are insuficient. Hemp is the only proven source for economical biomass fuels.",
