            "background": "There have been suggestions by the Rt Hon Gordon Brown MP, that the Civil Service pay award for 2006 should be kept below 2%, i.e. less than the Govt's own inflation figure. This frankly is an insult. Council Tax and Utility Bill have risen in 2006 by at least 8%. Civil Service pay needs to rise by at least 2.7% in 2006, just to allow us to keep up with these rises.",
