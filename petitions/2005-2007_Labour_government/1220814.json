            "background": "Recently a Muslim WPC refused to shake the hand of Commissioner of the Metropolis Sir Ian Blair and I think this is a disgrace on two counts: 1) It showed a complete disregard for respect toward not just a senior officer but THE MOST senior officer and 2) I get my application rejected because I have tattoos on my forearms that are neither racist nor could cause offence to anyone. One of them is a motif adopted by the Company I was in during my service in HM Royal Marines and the other is a panther. It just seems a shame that someone like me who gave excellent service in both Northern Ireland and Iraq cant even get an interview yet someone like that WPC can actually pass out and behave the way she did which to me does not befit a Police Officer",
