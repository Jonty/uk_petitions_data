            "background": "Over the years there were numerous cases of fatalities and injuries caused by wearing belts. Lethal injuries such as crushed sternum and paralyzing neck injuries are common in high speed collisions. Chest injury may cause cardiac arrest, lung bruises are amongst the most common causes of death by belts. In neck injury cases the pressure from an impact can cause a belt wearers head to accelerate forward suddenly while the body is restrained causing paralyzing injuries.\nSince most cars now come with airbags which don\u2019t cause the side effects of belts, airbags should take over and belts should not be mandatory. Airbags are shown to be more effective when they work than belts in preventing injuries",
