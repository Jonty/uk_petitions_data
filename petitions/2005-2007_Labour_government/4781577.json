            "action": "make funding available for extensions to the Sheffield Supertram from Dore to Parkgate (via Rotherham Centre) and from Ranmoor to Hellaby (via Royal Hallamshire Hospital and the Waverley/Orgreave development area) with the addition (subject to cost analysis) of the Lowedges to Northern General Hospital extension",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Sheffield Supertram has been a revelation since opening in March 1994.  With 11 million passengers carried annually (2003 figures), and each tram potentially removing 150 cars from the area's roads, the Supertram has enhanced the region's street environment, whilst also reducing congestion and pollution, benefiting pedestrians and motorists alike.  With this in mind, we the undersigned believe that the Supertram extensions set out above and at http://www.sheffield.gov.uk/?pgid=7857&fs=s would help meet New Labour's proposed 'Climate Change Bill', unveiled by the Environment Secretary, David Miliband, which proposes to set into law the crucial aim of cutting the UK's CO2 emissions by 60 per cent, on 1990 levels, by 2050.  Similar extensions also need to be permitted in Nottingham, Birmingham and Manchester, with the new systems proposed to be developed in Leeds, Liverpool and Edinburgh approved.",
