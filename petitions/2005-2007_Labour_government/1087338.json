            "background": "Can you afford to pay \u00a3131 for the BBC to repeat programmes until you remember all the lines that actors say? How can they justify asking for a raise in the Fee each year when they repeat programmes all throughout the year until the audiences are sick of them? Most people can\u2019t get extra BBC Channels such as BBC3; News 24 etc\u2026 unless they fork out again for a Freeview Box or pay monthly for digital.  If other channels are doing well without our money, then why doesn\u2019t the BBC make money through advertising rather than forcing us to pay the ridiculous fee?  Where is our money going? Please sign and support this petition!",
