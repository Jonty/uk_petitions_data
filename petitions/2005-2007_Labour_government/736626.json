            "background": "Noise pollution can seriously effect the health and well-being of residents forced to endure noise pollution from others' inconsiderate use of television and stereo volume controls. \nThese entertainment machines can rob others of sleep and the quiet enjoyment of their homes. \nWith the increasing trend of thinly built 'party' walls, lack of community feeling, and anti-social behaviour, more people each year are driven to extreme measures to try to solve this unrelenting problem. Police and council environmental health officers too infrequently use what powers they have to remove noise equipment, if the noise-offender can even hear officers knocking at their door. \nThe limiting of volume capacity during the manufacturing process, or with the use of a limiter device before the item is sold in this country, would avoid the risk of retaliation from either side, ill-feeling between neighbours, and seems the only sensible solution to this on-going and wide-spread problem.",
