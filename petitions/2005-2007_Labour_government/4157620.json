            "background": "I propose you not to raid dormant bank accounts.  Many older people use this as a way to store their money and may not touch their money for years but actually intend this to be inhereted by their childeren, they would be upset to find it has acutually been taken for other causes.   Claiming will be daunting for people especially if they are ill, unwell or elderly and don't understand the system.   Maybe the governemnt is hoping that this is the case so they can have more of someone elses money for themselves for called good causes, will we know where it is spent in the end, I would think untraceable? People may have moved house or forgotten about this money.  You should consider a much longer period or 50 years + then it should be throughly investegated that the money does not have an owner or family then maybe you could have their money.  This is legalised theft as it stands at the moment of just 15 years of a dormant bank account.  This is not your money to take for good causes let the owner and family decide where this money will be spent and not you.",
