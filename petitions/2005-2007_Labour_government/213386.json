It seems to me that we all want him gone, but the Prime Minister appears to have some sort of deal going behind the scenes to keep Prezza in office. Kow-tow-ing to the unions, perhaps ? In the thrall of Old Labour ? Or maybe he just wants someone else to blame for authorising the construction of all those new properties in areas where already there aren't enough schools / hospitals / water / jobs. You be the judge. 10,000 signatures will tell us if TB really values the will of the people or not.",
