            "background": "People's lives are blighted by the intrusion of ultra low frequency bass noise from popular music. It travels large distances and permeates into  homes causing extreme stress by invading personal space and destroying the aural environment in one's own home. People who are subjected to it are powerless to do anything about it. \nIt is created by the selfish actions of those who enjoy inflicting it upon the population by purchasing special loudspeakers (whoofers) to transmit the noise at large volumes through the open windows of their houses and vehicles.\nSuch noise is deliberately recorded by the industry in order to encourage this behaviour and Memorandums of Understanding should be negotiated to minimise the amount of such music which is sold in the U.K. \nPowers should be given to the Police to seize equipment which is used to produce levels beyond frequencies and volumes laid down by legislation.",
