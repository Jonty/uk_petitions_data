        "background": "I know this sounds like a desperate fan wanting revenge, but time and time again 15 seconds has proved to be enough time to score a goal.\nMy point is the referee called full time at 92 minutes and 15 second's when as per the 4th officals announcment of at least THREE minute's of extra time were to be played. This in turn has deprived us of enough time to equalize and force the game into extra time.\nOK this might seem petty but think of the extra revenue this would of brought into English football  plus the popularity and support of not liverpool but English football in Europe even the world.\n\nTHIS IS NOT JUST A FAN WHO IS BITTER, JUST SOMEONE WHO WANT'S THE GAME TO BE PLAYED FAIR.\n\nThank you",
