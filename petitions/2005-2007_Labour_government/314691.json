            "background": "The Humber Bridge has the highest toll charges in Britain (currently \u00a32.70 for a single car crossing).\n\nThis not only creates hardship for individuals; particularly those who have no choice but to use the bridge for commuting and hospital visits. It also holds the Humber region back economically.\n\nMuch of the current tolls are used to pay back the artificially high government loans provided over 25 years ago to build the bridge.\n\nThe government has the power to write off this debt. This would enable the Bridge Board to keep tolls at a fair level, based on maintenance and running costs.",
