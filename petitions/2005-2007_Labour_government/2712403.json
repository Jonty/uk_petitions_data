            "background": "The current criteria for benefits claimants, results in many families to claim significant benefits, including the cost of their housing, council tax and other essentials, and provides them with a net disposable income very often in excess of individuals and families who earn modest incomes.\n\nBenefits should be available to the unemployed, disabled, elderly and so on as currently, but benefits should be available based upon need. This means benefits should be paid based upon net disposable income, taking account of such items as housing costs, council tax and other essentials. Availability of benefits should not be assessed on flawed criteria such as number of hours that a husband or wife works.",
