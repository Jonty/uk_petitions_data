            "background": "In the past 2 years the Security Industry Authority, (S.I.A), has been created to increase the quality of training, status and credibility of the Security Industry. \n\nAlthough many changes have taken place, we feel that there is still room for much more improvement for Door Supervisors within the Security Industry; one of those being an end to working one man doors. \n\nA \u2018one man door\u2019 involves a Door Supervisor working by themselves, at a venue which may have anything from 20-200 plus people in at any given time. \n\nDuring those working hours, that 1 Door Supervisor, will be expected to carry out any number of duties, which may include the following: \n\nIdentifying customers on entry, Checking suitability of incoming patrons, Ensuring people have paid an entry fee, Crowd control,Monitoring the inside (including toilets), beer gardens and the surroundings of the venue, Ensuring that alcohol does not leave the premises, Ejection of patrons.\n\nDoor Supervisors working alone is not only dangerous for the person doing it, but also to the many people they come into contact with, within the context of their job.",
