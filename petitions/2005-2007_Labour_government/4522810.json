After loosing the nearest Cinema in 2006 to Chains 15 miles away do we really want to loose this theatre/dance hall/function venue too!!\nThere is surely other plans for parking that could be made such as turning the car park across the road in to a multi-story one. Please don't take this Venue from us which has had some famous names sell out its seating and continues to be so very popular. Get the council to listern to the peoples oppinion and to survey for alternatives!!!",
