            "background": "Since almost all bus lanes carry hardly any buses, even in the rush hour, they contribute greatly to congestion and slow the traffic considerably. Scrap them and restore full width roads. Cars and commercial vehicles are the majority who contribute billions of Pounds too much in fuel duty and road tax, let them, at least, have unobstructed use of the roads. Free flowing traffic generates less carbon to cause global warming.",
