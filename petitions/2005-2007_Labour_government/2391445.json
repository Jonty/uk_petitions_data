            "background": "When planning permission is rightly & democratically refused by local authorities, with the full support of hundreds, if not thousands of local people, the current 'appeal' process allows the handful of individuals in Bristol or the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM) to have overall decision on the matter. This is not a democratic process. In 99% of cases, local opinion (people who actually have to live with these decisions on a daily basis & for years to come) is steam-rolled in favour of financial gain & power, by people whom it will never effect. Neither applicants (building developers or corporations eg phone masts) or the ODPM have an interest or consideration for the impact to our quality of life. How can thousands of citizens\u2019 voices be so easily & readily pushed aside & ignored? The current process undermines & devalues our democratic rights. This must be changed, with power given back to the people who have the best interest & understanding of the area they live in.",
