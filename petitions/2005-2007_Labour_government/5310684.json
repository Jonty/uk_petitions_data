            "background": "Coventry Airport has recently had its request for planning permission to build a new passenger terminal refused by the secretary of state after a public inquiry. The city of Coventry has suffered a large number of job losses recently with the closure of many high profile factories, including Jaguar and Peugot, and the airport would have employed many local people who have their jobs in recent closures. This refusal may also mean that the airport may have to make staff redundant. We ask that the government reconsiders its decision to refuse planning permission for this terminal.",
