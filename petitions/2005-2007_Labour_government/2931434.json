            "background": "To the goverment and transport ministers, forgive my bad grammar and spelling mistakes, but have you thought the road tolls through as Mr Darling mentioned \u00a31.37 per mile on motorways and 2-3p per mile on 'A' roads if this is correct then A roads would become gridlocked because a 4o mile journey to and from work just on the motorway itself would cost for 5 days a week 47 weeks of the year which allows  for the 5 weeks holiday a year most people get. \u00a312,878 per year which does not count petrol, mot, road tax, 'A' road driving, going out to places of intrest such as stately homes, theme parks, all of which rely on the motorist for business and these are just a few perhaps it be better to put it on petrol it's easier to collect,and fairer if you have a big engine vehicle you pay for it by the mile anyway.",
