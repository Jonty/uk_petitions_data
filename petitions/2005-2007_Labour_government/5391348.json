        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There is nothing nice about NICE. They are nasty. And ageist, and use woefully inadequate research to come to decisions which are at times quite unbelievable. They place no value on older people's quality of life and have decided that people in the early stages of the disease do not benefit from drugs enough to make them cost effective. They clearly asked no one suffering with the disease or anyone who has cared for a loved one, and lost them to Alzheimers.  They would no doubt claim the drugs are worth their weight in gold - and some. People desperately want and need these drugs. This issue is currently being fought out in court, I hope NICE are thoroughly shamed for their continued incompetence, shoddy choice of statistical tools that are known to be inapropriate for the use they have applied them to, and disgusting decision.",
