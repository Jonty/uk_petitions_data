            "background": "Rural post offices are the lifeline and centre of community in thousands of villages across Great Britain.  Postmasters and postmistresses provide a wide range of official and social services for the communities they serve and are an essential part of community life.  Closure of post offices will result in many people, especially the disadvantaged, elderly and infirm having to travel large distances, often with no public transport, to deal with pensions, parcels and payments.  This is unsatisfactory and closures of thousands of offices must be resisted.",
