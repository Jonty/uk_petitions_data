            "background": "Folic acid is essential to the healthy development of children. We should simply do as many other countries have done long ago - fortify flour with folic acid. Many pregnancies start before the mother is prepared, and can start folic acid too late to prevent what would be otherwise preventable birth defects. This is a clear saving to society and a benefit to children and families. Let's catch up with the western world and fortify now.",
