        "background": "Richard has long been the finest beer and lager connoisseur in the West of Scotland. He has seen it as his mission to inform and educate the people of Glasgow and Paisley in the ways of the hop. There is literally nothing that he does not know about beer and lager, not only thanks to his reading on the subject, but also his frequent visits to the pubs (both good and bad) of the West of Scotland. If you want to know what makes a good Pint, Richard is your man. All you have to do is ask. And many do. Such a service to the common man deserves to be recognised.",
