            "background": "There is a crudeness and cruelty in modern so-called comedy - something never found in Ronnie Barker's shows. He had the ability to be funny yet not offensive as many of the modern day comedians are so often now. Ronnie Barker was a true all round talent overlooked many times during his life. He thorougly deserves a Knighthood as he brought millions of people to hysterics and tears of laughter with his divine comedy.\n\nAs many of the modern day comedians will acknowledge, Barker was an inspiration and genius with his use of language and deserves to be recognised as one of the greatest all round talents in entertainment that this country has ever produced.",
