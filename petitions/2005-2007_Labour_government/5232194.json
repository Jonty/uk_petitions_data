            "background": "The 2012 olympic logo is a bad design and needs to be re-thought.\n\nIt fails to make proper use of the olympic rings which should be a key element in the design. There is also no representation of the British nation - it would have been nice to include our national colours.\n\nWe need a new design chosen by the British public, perhaps through some form of competition. Afterall, the games are meant to be an event that brings our communities together.\n\nIf you agree with me then please vote now - it is never too late to bring about change.",
