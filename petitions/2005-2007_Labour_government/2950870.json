        "background": "When I left school some twenty years ago I was not taught, nor given the opportunity, of learning about politics. It would seem that from my experience today in higher education, that most students I teach do not get the oportunity to be taught politics at secondary school. This is a crucial subject for young people to learn about and may even encourage them to engage more than they presently do in politics. Students sometimes are taught Citizenship, but as far as I can tell theis has little effect on their knowledge about politics.",
