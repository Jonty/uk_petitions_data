            "background": "Why should the motorist pay for cycle lanes that bicycles don't even use? Don't you think it's about time that we caught all the cyclists that jump red lights or jump onto a pavement to make an illegal turn. Why should the police turn a blind eye to cyclists with no lights? You know who will get the blame if a motorist knocks one over!! These irresponsible cyclists are giving the good ones a bad name. So let's register every cycle over a certain wheel size (adult bikes), so that they can account for their actions and possibly be easier to track and trace should a bike be stolen.",
