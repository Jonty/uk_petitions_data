Im not suggesting the driving test we all had to pass but a compency test for reaction times, hesitancy, ability to see etc...for everybody not just oap's. Safety should ALWAYS be paramount. If we are as good and as confident in driving as we think we are, the test shouldnt worry anybody but it will stop alot of accidents.",
