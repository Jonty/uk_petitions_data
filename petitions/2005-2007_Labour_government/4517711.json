        "background": "Forenzic science is the reason why we are able to prevent serial killers from claiming more lives, The reason why many criminals are brought to justice, the reason why the police can look good! Don't belive it! the police just make the arrest and do all the physical stuff. without the fingerprints on the weapons, the traces on the criminals clothing, the evidence at the crime scene, the DNA matching, the single hair fibre recovered, none of the arrests or the physical police work would be possible. \n\nSo all I ask, is that the public and the government recognise the hard work of the Coroners, Forensic Scientists, and crime scene annalysts. They are the ones that solve crime and bring justice.",
