            "background": "The use of barbed hooks for coarse fishing causes unnecessary suffering to fish, sometimes even resulting in the loss of most of the lip tissue, following repeated catching of the same fish in small lakes and waters.\nThe fish can also swallow the hooks, causing internal injury and sometimes death, when the barbed hook is removed.\nWildlife also suffer from discarded fishing hooks and line, they would find it easier to free themselves if the hooks were barb less.\nBarb less hooks are readily available from fishing tackle shops",
