All are fully funded by the Government except the RNLI which has to rely on donations and has to pay VAT and taxes amounting to c. \u00a32.2m per annum. The Irish Government excludes the RNLI in Ireland from taxes, but in the UK, it's claimed this isn't possible. If this is so, the Government should adequately fund the RNLI as the other Emergency Services.",
