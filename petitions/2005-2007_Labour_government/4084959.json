            "background": "Dunham Toll Bridge is a quarter of a mile long bridge on the A57 crossing the River Trent at Dunham on Trent linking Lincolnshire with Nottinghamshire. The bridge is the subject of the Dunham Bridge (Amendment) Act 1994 and is owned and operated by the Dunham Bridge Company. Lincolnshire County Council is the second largest shareholder in DBC. Traffic is heavy (4 million vehicles annually), particularly from spring to autumn as the bridge is used by visitors from North Notts and South Yorks to/from the Skegness area. The bridge is a strategic crossing and the tolls therefore have a major economic impact on the region and the lives of local people. On 1 March 2007, the Toll for cars was increased by 20% to 30p one way. There are no season tickets of discounted prepaid tolls. A Public Inquiry regarding the toll increase was held in October 2006.",
