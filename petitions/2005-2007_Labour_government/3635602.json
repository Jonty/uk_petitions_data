I believe that the government should only be charging stamp duty at 1% on \u00a3124,000. The first \u00a3125,000 should be free of duty on all house purchases no matter what value of the property.\nIf you take income tax as an example, if you fall into the 40% tax bracket, you don't pay 40% on your total earnings you still have your personal tax allowance.\n\nAlso review the current stamp duty scales 1%,3% & 4%. When I went to school there used to be 2 between 1 and 3",
