        "action": "Force financial instutions and insurance companies to pay out the minimum guaranteed amounts on endowment policies that have been mis-sold.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It seems the public pay the price whichever way you cut it whilst the financial institutions still make millions, nay billions, in profits each year.  They should be held to account and forced to pay out the minimum guaranteed amounts as these policies were taken out predominantly to pay off mortgages by people who could ill afford to make up shortfalls in the thousands.  Their mistake - they should pay.  Even winning a case via the Financial Ombudsman does not guarantee any money back - in my case the victory was moral only but it does not pay my mortgage.",
