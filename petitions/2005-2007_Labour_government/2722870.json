            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Geothermal heat is free, currently there is no incentive to reduce the high price of installation. A goverment backed drive would result in the reduction in gas / electricity demands to meet the Kyoto targets. The resultant reductions in the price of installations would make retrofitting economically viable when replacing existing systems and reduce the payback period considerably.",
