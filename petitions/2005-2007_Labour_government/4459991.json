        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The cost of creating the unitary authority and the ongoing costs for running two parallel authorities providing the same services in Norfolk will result in waste, inefficient services and higher charges for the Council tax payer of Norfolk as a whole. This also runs in contradiction to stated government policy for shared services which could be done most effectively along current authority responsibilities.\n\nWe understand there is a second petition for rejecting Norwich City Council's proposals, but this is on the basis of revised Council boundaries, which have already been rejected.",
