            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As all cars systems are now electronically controlled, makers should install a tamper-proof method of putting an absolute  ceiling on greenhouse gas exhaust emissions per second of vehicle operation when stationary, and per metre when travelling. This will have the added benefits of greater road safety due to reduced harsh accelerations and speeds, and reduce imports of fossil fuels. Users will not be hurt over vehicle choice, just wasteful fuel consumption.  Limits shall be set for each current road vehicle class e.g. motorbike, car, 7.5T, LGV etc, the vehicle performance not affected, just the absolute maximum CO2 output per second or metre. Harsh accelerations are not needed, e.g. a 40T LGV only needs 100bhp to cruise in urban areas",
