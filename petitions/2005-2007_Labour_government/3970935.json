Signing this petition will state your endorsement of the principal of an 'Electro-cracy' - a process through which contentious issues such as; foreign policy, road pricing, MP salaries, prison sentences and a like, can be voted for in a monthly referendum, where votes are registered over the internet, by text message or through a telephone hotline.  This will (with refinement) ingender a new sense of political involvement, where government policy is truly indicative of societal conscience.",
