            "action": "stop misleading the electorate that the impact of airport expansion can be managed through inclusion of aviation emissions into the European Carbon Trading Scheme. The government should either spell out exactly how this is possible, or withdraw the plans for airport expansion. Furthermore, we believe that the UK can not take a credible leadership position on climate change on the international stage whilst our government continues to pursue airport expansion and that our reputation abroad is being damaged.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "When questioned by the Environmental Audit Committee on the inclusion of aviation into the European Trading Scheme, the transport secretary Douglas Alexander said \"In terms of where we are in those negotiations, the evidence from the public statements of Lufthansa, even in the last 48 hours, evidences that the argument is not yet won within the aviation community. It is also no secret that some of our international partners are less than convinced of the merits even of a European scheme, never mind a wider scheme given the global nature of air travel.\"\n\nHowever the governement still says that addition aviation emissions can be managed through the European Trading Scheme.\n\nClimate change is the most serious issue facing us. We need to take action. The conclusions of the IPCC report are unequivocal. They apply to us all. We must recognise this and we must all play our part in changing our expectations. We can not kid ourselves into thinking that our individual actions are some how too important and should override the scientific advice.",
