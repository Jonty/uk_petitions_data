            "background": "Before the Sunday Trading Act 1994, people lived happily without a need to shop on Sundays.\n\nSundays were a day for families, for rest, for visits to grandparents and parks, to do the garden, a day off. The roads were quieter, neighbourhoods cleaner & peaceful.\n\nSince Sunday opening, roads are busier, families (those with shop workers) are split up with people working, and an end has been seen to the the traditional weekend. Service levels in retail have dropped, as experienced full-time staff have given way to less experienced part-time employees to make up the longer trading hours.\n\nI urge the Prime Minister to repeal Sunday Trading - to force shops other than local shops and off-licences to close on Sundays (a return to the pre-1994 trading conditions) and large fines on any shop that violates the law.\n\nAfter all, we don't spend more because the shops are open longer - we spend the same, just over a different period. It won't affect levels of shop trade!\n\nKeep Sunday Special!",
