            "background": "The Queen recently approved a Government proposal for the issue of a medal to recognise service by civilians and others involved in the reconstruction and transition to to democracy in Iraq. Whilst this is a welcome development, we are concerned that Iraqi Locally Employed Civilians (LECs) have been specifically excluded from receiving the medal.\n\nIraqi civilians take a great risk in deciding to work for the Coalition and many have been murdered as a result of their employment. During attacks on Coalition bases they face the same dangers as British workers and soldiers.\n\nIraqi LECs have given considerable service to the Coalition in a diverse range of roles - from cleaners to interpreters. It is our belief that this service deserves to be recognised in the same manner in which the service of British civilians in Iraq is recognised.",
