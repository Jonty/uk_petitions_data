Allow us the right to hold gatherings for the purpose of having a good time, without the interference of the police in its attempts to stop access and preventing us from holding these gatherings.  We as human beings are natural interactors and to deny are freedom to go out, interact with a wide verity of people, to not allow a community of close nit people to all meet up and do what we do best (which is to have fun) is beyond all reason and in my mind is ridicules.",
