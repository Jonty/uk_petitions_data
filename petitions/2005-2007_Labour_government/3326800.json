            "background": "to take the control and running of the school meal service out of local council control, and hand to an  independent controller. there is too much inconsistency and  competition between the different councils, who try to make profit above all else (ie unfair treatment of staff) school meals should be run as a non profitable organisation, this is the only way forward for a brilliant school meal service, and staff would be paid for all the hours they work,  and our children would get the meals they deserve.\nthankyou",
