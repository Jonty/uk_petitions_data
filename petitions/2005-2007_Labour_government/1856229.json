            "background": "BSkyB is seeking to replace Sky Three, Sky News and Sky Sports News on the Freeview (DTT) platform with pay TV channels that will include sport and movies. The channels would be encoded using a different video system to the existing system and as such would require the purchase of a different set top box. The public are already confused by the different array of boxes that allow people to receive Freeview digital terrestrial TV. The Sky box would be about the 4th type and may put Sky satellite TV at an advantage by making it seem easier to purchase and install, with fewer confusing choices to make.\n\nAlso Freeview should not be allowed to be slowly taken over by various and conflicting Pay TV companies. It would destroy the platform.\n\nKeep Freeview Free!",
