I think it is unfair that pregnant women are missing this vital service due to where they live, or being forced into paying in excess of \u00a3100 for the scan to be performed privately. This scan isn't abut wanting to see your baby; it is about identifying and diagnosing potential life threatening problems and I think it is unfair that local Health Authorities decide who can and cannot have the scan.",
