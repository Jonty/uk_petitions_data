        "background": "Swedish Snus is an oral tobacco product which, thanks to the manufacturing process, presents minimal health risk to the user, as borne out in a number of scientific studies. Swedish research has shown no significant risk of oral, oesophagal or intestinal cancer. There are some acknowledged health risks but they are much smaller than those presented by smoked tobacco or other forms of oral tobacco. However the EU has a blanket ban on oral tobacco products. Will the Prime Minister please campaign for legalisation of Swedish Snus in the EU as a harm-reduction measure?",
