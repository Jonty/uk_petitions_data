        "background": "local councils seem to interfere with residential planning applications and more often than not the objections are petty and spurious and frequently overturned following a lengthy and expensive Appeal to the Inspectorate. Force a 'hands off' design approach by laying down national guidelines or at least Inspectorate approved guidelines that effectivly permitt a greater freedom to build residential houses and extend existing. At present the local coucil can stop a development because one of its non UK resident planning officers doesn't like it and Appeal can take 18 months or more.",
