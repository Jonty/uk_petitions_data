            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Most migrant workers bring their children to the country to join them. The issue however is that these children have less priveledges than other children their age. The government emphasis that youths should stay in education for as long as possibel but this only possible as long as they have the opportunity. Universties charge higher fees to these students which average \u00a39000, which is unaffordable to the average working class family. Most of these youths do not come here by choice but have to do so to join the families so it is only fair to give them an equal opportunity to be able to gain a future. Please sign a petition so that the future of ethnic minority teenagers can be brighter.",
