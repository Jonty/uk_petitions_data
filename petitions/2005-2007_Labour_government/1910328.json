            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Peel Holdings in Manchester, owners of the Trafford Centre, are on the verge of destroying one of the largest remaining forests in the North of England. If their plan of building a racecourse goes ahead, thousands of trees, wildlife and a protected Heronry dating back to the Duke of Bridgewater days will be lost forever. Once built this unwanted monstrosity will attract over 10,000 vehicles a day into the woodland racecourse. \nI urge you all to sign this petition to show that the people of Salford do not want this development on our doorstep. Not now or in the next 100 years.\nWe are not Nimbys or Luddites as Fred the Salford \u2018Bookie\u2019 called us. We are people who take pride in where we live, who know that there is no need for a racecourse \u2013 not at the cost of total decimation of historic prime green belt.",
