        "background": "I'm fed up of the lack of balance being made between the 'reducing car use' measures and initiatives, against the lack of public transport alternatives.\n\nIt's fine in London and other cities, but what about the huge amount of people who live outside cities but work in the cities?\n\nThe 2 or 3 buses a day doesn't cut it.\n\nI want to go green but it's just not an option.",
