        "background": "Men with long-hair are still discriminated against in the workplace, with legal precidence (Smith v Safeway 2000).  The Court of Appeal ruled that this did not constitute sex discrimination. They stated that appearance codes which apply 'conventional standards' will be seen to apply an even handed approach between the sexes and not to be discriminatory, and held that a restriction which extends beyond the workplace is a factor to be taken into account in considering whether the rule treats one sex less favourably but is not conclusive by itself.  We disagree!  The term \u201cconventional standards\u201d is erroneous. Who sets the conventional standard? Who decides this? Do these institutions demand that women grow their hair. After all, isn't it \u201ctraditional\u201d that men have short hair and women long hair?\nWe DEMAND an Act of Parliament prohibiting this sort of discrimination.",
