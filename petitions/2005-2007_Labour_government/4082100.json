            "background": "Our local council, Caradon in Cornwall, want to withdraw funding for the RNLI to provide a Life Guard Service at Whitsand Bay.\nThe Whitsand Bay Surf Life Saving Club was formed 49 years ago after a spate of drownings.  As tourism in the area became more popular the club were not able to patrol the beach to the levels req'd to maintain the safety of water users in the summer season, so Caradon council stepped in & provided a paid life guard service.  In 2001 the council contracted this service out to the RNLI. Caradon have now decided to cease funding for the RNLI to provide the service.  The RNLI provides equipment & training so Caradon just have to cover wages for the life guards.\nTHIS COULD HAPPEN ON ANY BEACH IN THE UK. DOES IT HAVE TO TAKE MORE DROWNINGS!",
