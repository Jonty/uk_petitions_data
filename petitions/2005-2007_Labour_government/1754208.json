        "background": "There is no need for waste to go to landfill anymore - if produced in a suitable manner, in keeping with recent developments, all waste can be dealt with in the UK, and either recycled or composted.  A large proportion of the packaging the UK wishes to recycle is dealt with in countries as far away as China.  Recycling should be dealt with in the UK, not thousands of miles away; the journey to China creates thousands of tonnes of CO2 emissions, completely negating the initial act of recycling the product.  Additionally, the government should put in place legislation to awards businesses that do not over-package their products, and that may penalise those that needlessly over-package what they sell. \n\n\n** RECYCLE UK WASTE IN THE UK\n** PROVIDE DESIGNATED COMPOSTING SITES IN ALL LOCAL AREAS, WITH TWICE WEEKLY COLLECTIONS OF 'COMPOSTABLE MATTER'.\n** MAKE ALL PACKAGING MINIMAL\n** MAKE ALL PLASTIC PACKAGING & BAGS COMPOSTABLE",
