            "background": "Tony Blair needs to stop the war in Iraq as it is costing us millions and millions of pounnds.  Innocent lives are being lost every year on both sides while other countries sit back and watch our resources waste away whilst they continue to push for development and growth.  The UK public are frustrated with the way our international affairs are being governed, because we the UK citizens should be the number one priority.  There needs to be a change and the wealth that we as a country have built over the centuries needs to be spent wisely and in this country.  The alternative is we will no longer be competitive as a nation and this will be reflected through the coming generations, which is already visible.  Just look at what is happening to our youngsters in this country and that's because they are being neglected by the government.  Tony needs to realise that charity starts at home before you start to donate to other causes especially when our help isn't appreciated nor required.",
