What right do these groups have to have superior authority over any other members of the general public simply because they believe in tales that were writted thousands of years ago? Take a step back and it's easy to see that the whole concept is proposterous and the fact that some of these groups can determine whether a law or legislation can be passed is simply mindnumbing.",
