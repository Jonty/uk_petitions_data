            "background": "The recent weather has been completely unacceptable, with continuous and persistent rain almost every day for the last month. The ground is saturated and cannot absorb any more water, but still there appears to be no let up in the weather. We do not need any more rain. Everyone I speak to is ill, grumpy, depressed or all three, and they all blame the weather. Some dry spells and sunshine would make people feel better, so lessening the burden on the overstretched NHS. When people feel better they are also more productive, and this would be better for the economy. A guaranteed three dry days each week would enable everyone to benefit, while still ensuring we received enough rain to keep the rivers and reservoirs at an acceptable level.",
