            "background": "It's clear that care of the elderly in the UK is in crisis.\n\nThe care system relies on the goodwill of carers who have made great personal and financial sacrifices to carry out their duties. The present generation of carers have limited pension prospects and many have no children to care for them in their own old age, an aspect of the demographic time bomb that seems to have been largely ignored. \n\nThis situation is not good for the elderly, their carers, or the country and needs to be addressed as a matter of urgency.\n\nA Royal Commission would be able to carry out a wide-ranging enquiry into all aspects of the care system, collecting evidence from all concerned, enabling it to make recommendations which would help to ensure a secure future for all of us.\n\nIf you agree that action is required, please sign this petition.",
