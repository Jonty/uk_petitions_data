            "background": "Stamp duty on houses not only hits first time buyers hard it also encourages inflated house prices.  If it was replaced with a tax on the profit on the sale of a property it would help first time buyers to get on the property ladder and help slow the unsustainable growth in house prices which in the past have led to huge economic problems.  I believe this would be seen as a much fairer tax and would penalise greed.",
