NOT MARRIED, AND LIVING IN SEPARATE ACCOMODATION, EVEN IF THEY HAVE CHILDREN TOGETHER, THEN THE PERSON WHO LOSES THEIR JOB CAN CLAIM INCOME SUPPORT OR JOB SEEKERS\u2019 ALLOWANCE? \n\nSURELY THIS BOTH DISCRIMATES AGAINST MARRIED COUPLES AND DISCOURAGES PEOPLE FROM THINKING ABOUT LIVING TOGETHER AS A FAMILY WHEN THEY KNOW THEY WILL LOSE THEIR ENTITLEMENT TO BENEFITS SHOULD THE WORST HAPPEN.",
