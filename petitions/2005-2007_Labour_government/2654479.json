            "background": "We need to curb developers from building towering 3 storey houses and flats close to existing properties, depriving them of light, and in some cases creating potential for unwanted surveillance by owners of the new properties. High density housing developments (40 units per hectare) are the norm these days, and they blight the communities in the midst of which they are built. They also deprive towns of valuable green space to soak up rainwater & retain natural habitat for wild birds and other wildlife.",
