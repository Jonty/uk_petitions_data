            "background": "Every day thousands of hectares of ancient forest are destroyed. When just one hectare of forest is cleared up to 200 cubic tons of carbon is released into the atmosphere. The total annual carbon emissions from forest clearance out weighs the carbon output of even the USA. There is currently little incentive for developing countries or landowners to preserve their forest. Extending the World Bank's BioCarbon Credits scheme to include \u201cAvoided Deforestation\u201d or allowing \"forest preservation\" projects as certifiable and tradable CERs (Certified Emissions Reductions) would provide the incentive for developing nations and landowners to protect their forests and our climate.",
