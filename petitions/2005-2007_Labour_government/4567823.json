            "background": "There has been a breaking down of local culture and family values within Britain for a number of years.  This can be seen by the increase of youth crime.  What is needed are local groups to build pride in the community by learning about history, British culture and assisting other members of the community which in turn will promote stonger bonds both at home and in the community.  Maybe using local sports days, progressing to national leagues and other sponsored events would be a start.  Maybe Medieval town events to promote British history.",
