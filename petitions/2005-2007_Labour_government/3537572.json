        "background": "Bowater House is currently being demolished. The area which is now a building site joins Hyde Park to Sloane Street. A piazza would merge  the shopping metropolis of Sloane Street, Knightsbridge and Harrods to the calm of the Park.The apartment block proposed would break the two areas up. The proposed Piazza would bring London together and be of great benefit to all. London is quite a departmentislised city - such a piazza would broaden the appeal of the Park and the beauty of the capital.",
