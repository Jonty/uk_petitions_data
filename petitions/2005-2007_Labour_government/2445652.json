            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Huge numbers of employers now refuse to pay employees any pay for the first 5 days of illness and thereafter expect them to claim statutory sick pay from the government. As these workers are usually the lowest paid in the country this policy causes real economic suffering, and ultimately worsens the individual's long term health if forced to work when ill. Few low paid workers can bear the loss of 5 days wages (which is nearly a quarter of the month\u2019s earnings). At my own place of employment, employees have lost their accommodation due to loss of earnings through sickness, and collapsed at work due to not being able to financially afford to take time off work when sick. Ill people are unable to adequately fulfil their duties at work. In addition, it is the law that food handlers stay home for 3 days after diarrhoea or sickness episodes. They should be paid sick pay to stay at home to fulfil the law rather than having to bear the cost themselves.",
