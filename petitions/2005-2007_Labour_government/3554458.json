            "background": "Fining people who drop litter in the UK is a totally draconian measure and almost impossible to enforce. I propose three things:\n\n(1) Reintroduce the Keep Britain Tidy campaign to the British public; \n\n(2) Bring legislation into effect which requires people who have been given community sentences or anti-social behaviour orders to spend a reasonable amount of time picking up litter from, and cleaning, the streets of Britain; and\n\n(3) Introduce more litter bins throughout Britain, all of which should be provided with compartments for items to be recycled.\n\n It would be wonderful to walk along pavements which aren\u2019t strewn with food and drink containers, cigarette ends, chewing gum and spit, to name but a few items.\n\nMake our streets clean again!",
