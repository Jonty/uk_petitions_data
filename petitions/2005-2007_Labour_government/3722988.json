        "background": "Carers on Carers Allowance receive \u00a346 per week. People on Jobseekers Allowance or Incapacity Benefit receive \u00a356 per week. It is incomprehensible to me that carers are considered to need less to live on than unemployed people. Please raise Carers Allowance so that we earn at least as much as unemployed people.\n\nWe are only entitled to Carers Allowance if we are full-time carers i.e. at least 35 hours per week. This means that we are exactly the kind of carer who cannot take on a job to supplement our incomes.  \n\nPlease raise Carers Allowance to at least \u00a356 per week.",
