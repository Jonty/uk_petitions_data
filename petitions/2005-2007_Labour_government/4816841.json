        "action": "stop our fishing fleets having to throw catches overboard because they have reached there quotas for certain species",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "when fishermen reach their catch limits for certain species ,they are forced to throw them overboard. This is meant to protect fish stocks for the future,but at this point the fish are already dead so this makes no sense at all. Is it not a more sensible idea for the fish which are above and beyond the limits to be traded at the point of return to harbour, if one skipper has too many cod, then he could trade with another skipper who has too many monkfish etc, and in this way less time would have to be spent at sea, and less fish would have to be taken because we would not have the ludicrous situation we now have with every boat on every sea and ocean reaping every living creature from the seabed , and then throwing half of the catch back again ,to rot on the bottom of the ocean because it was killed on the way up, but they are breaking the law if they keep the catch.",
