        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Before public transport was de-regulated by the last party to hold office, this country had a thriving and improving public transport system, especially in the Tyne metropolitan area, where one weekly \u00a35 ticket could be used on the bus, train, metro or ferry at low cost to the public with regular frequent services. By bringing back regulation of public transport, it would improve the public transport system, lower prices and lessen carbon emissions as people would not need to use their cars nearly as much, this would also alleviate pressure on the motorist for government tax's and tolls whilst allowing the government to hit their carbon emission targets.",
