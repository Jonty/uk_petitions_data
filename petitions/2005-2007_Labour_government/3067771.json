            "background": "As a Council tenant myself, who suffered a lot of insecurity on housing issues before I became one,I was horrified to read in my paper that Will Hutton and Professor John Hill have recommended imposing time limits on how long individual tenants can remain in their homes.  What is supposed to happen to them after the expiry of this time?  Where are they to live then?  Surely a decent, and above all SECURE, home is a basic human right; and not everyone, especially those on the minimum wage, can afford to buy one. I would appeal to all 3 million of my fellow council tenants to sign this petition to try to ensure this doesn't happen.",
