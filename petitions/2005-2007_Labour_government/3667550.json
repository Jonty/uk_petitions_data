            "background": "Responsible gun owners are as enraged and saddened by deaths caused by criminal use of guns. We bow our heads in sympathy and dread such a thing happening again.\nHowever, banning airguns, or any guns, achieves nothing because of the illegal guns that are freely available.\nWe accept tightening of the law, or putting the guns on certificates. But an outright ban will harm legitimate target and sporting/pest control use.\nThis has been proven by the handgun ban since which handgun crime has INCREASED due to illegal weapons.",
