        "background": "We have already \"sleep-walked\" into a surveillance society, where emails & phone  are routinely tapped, CCTV is ubiquitous, vehicle tracking is already common, and soon there will be ID cards. Coupled with the various anti-terrorism bills and the Civil Contingencies Act, we the UK citizenry are losing most of our privacy.\n\nWe therefore petition the Prime Minister to prove the principle that if you have nothing to hide you have nothing to fear  by subjecting each and every minister including himself to public continuous surveillance using video cameras. Apart from the bathroom no MP will have any privacy.",
