        "background": "Private firework displays should be banned as they are dangerous. The noise caused is very loud causing many animals and pets to become very distressed. Sometimes so distressed that it causes death. My family found our dog dead in the back garden. We was about to bring her in. She died of a heart attack because of the shock from the firework noises. People let of too many fireworks, the noise was really bad, and is only getting worse. \n\nThere should only be public displays. These are safer and more value for money. \n\nPlease sign this petition to help protect your pets.",
