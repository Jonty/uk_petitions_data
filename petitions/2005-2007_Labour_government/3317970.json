            "background": "during your working life you pay income tax on all you earn,When paying into a private pension you get an allowance for your private pension, When you have retired if your private pension comes over \u00a32,150 you then have to pay 22% on your pension, My arguement is that you do not get an allowance of 22% when you are paying into a pension so why should you be penalised for something that you have paid yourself, My father is 100yrs old come May and he is still paying income tax, I think its a disgrace, Oh the M.Ps will say we have to pay also but we are not earning their salary. Those who's pension goes up to \u00a331150 still only pay 22% does it really seem fair. Sign up fight for your loved ones and yourself now.",
