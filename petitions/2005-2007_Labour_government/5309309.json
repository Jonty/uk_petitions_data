The whole nature of these petitions is merely to address pointless issues which could be easily dealt with on their own accord, and are an example of how cowardly our country has become. I propose that this website should not be allowed to carry on petitioning in this way, and measures to curb this and other subversive methods to overturn our society should be taken.",
