            "background": "That the Government consider creating Freight Routes to work in partnership with exisiting infrastructure to allow freight and commercial traffic to move freely and economically without being held up by private vehicles, especially at peak times.  Not all roads would need it, just the main tributary routes around the country ie A303 during the summer would benefit from a seperate freight route.\n\nThese routes need only be single carriage and have adequate parking and rest facilities.",
