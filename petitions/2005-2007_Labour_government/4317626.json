            "background": "I am starting this petition to bring to the attention of everyone the Extotionate Road Tax Charges on so called \"gas Guzzling\" Cars to be brought in between 2008-09. I demand that the price be lowered untill the PUBLIC roads are in a shape to demand this high fee ie: Pot holes and open drains. And I urge everyone that if either is not done, to Boycott The Road tax charge starting on April 1st 2008 untill either is implemented. Please, Please I urge you the Motorist being ripped off to follow this through we can change the government they work for us, we just need to stand together and stand firm!! There are other ways to tax the road without paying through the nose, sign other petitions about scraping road tax and placing the difference on fuel, we already pay for both anyway why should we be punished for the things we want in life? Please sign and stand fast on the Boycott. Please!",
