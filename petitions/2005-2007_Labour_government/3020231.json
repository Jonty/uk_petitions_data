        "background": "As in many other countries, we should be allowed the right to display pride in our heritage and upbringing by flying a flag. No other country that I know of restricts its nationals in displays of national pride, and in many it is seen as a lower form of treason to not promote it. Yet here in Britain, we are told that in displaying any form of national pride is tantamount to inciting racial hatred toward people of other nations now residing in our country.",
