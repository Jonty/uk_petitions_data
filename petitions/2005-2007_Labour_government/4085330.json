        "background": "The government are looking to make bin collections every 2 weeks instead of every one.  They say that if we properly close bags/properly wrap food etc there should not be a health problem.  This was tried in my local government area.  IT DID NOT WORK.  The SMELL on the streets was awful, we saw an increase in VERMIN and as for the ammount of FLIES and OVERFLOWING bins (despite recycling too I must add!!!).  Needless to say that with pressure from the public, the local government reverted back to weekly collections.  I think that some of those on the local government also opposed bi weekly collections.  We do not need to increase any health risks, especially for our children as there is an increase in ASTHMA and DIABETES in children, the health risks to these sufferers will be immense (I know... my son is 5 and diagnosed with diabetes at the age of 1).",
