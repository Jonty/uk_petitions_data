            "background": "The TV license fee is too high and it keeps increasing to pay for the expansion of the BBC into the digital TV and internet markets.  However, In this day and age we are offered more choice of channels and therefore spend less time watching the BBC channels but we are being asked to pay more for this service in order to fund the BBCs expansion for new channels and various other internet based projects.\nWe need to limit the BBC funding to provide only BBC1/BBC2 and BBC radio stations.  If the BBC wishes to expand then it should fund its extra stations through commercial ventures and advertising, we should not have to pay more for using the BBC less.",
