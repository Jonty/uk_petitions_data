        "background": "I hope people take up this petition as I believe that the hard working private sector tax paying population is not getting value for money for the contributions they are putting into the system. Why should they be expected to put up with a lesser pention than someone who works for the public sector. As private sector pensions are not about to be increased, then public sector pensions should be reduced. WE CAN NOT AFFORD THEM!",
