        "action": "encourage landlords to make properties they rent/let energy efficient",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There are accepted monetary savings on fuel bills associated with energy efficient measures, such as insulation or double glazing.  It is seen that most tenants who live in properties without these measures are being penalised with their fuel bills and tend to be on low incomes.  Landlord should be made to pay this extra fuel if certain energy efficiency measures are not in place, with safe guards in place that would make it illegal for them to pass this cost on to the tenants though additional or increased charges/fees.\n\nIn order to encourage and reward landlords who meet high energy efficient standards in properties they rent certain incentives could be introduced for the installation of energy efficient measures, such as renewable energy sources (e.g. solar panels), which meet minimum government standards.",
