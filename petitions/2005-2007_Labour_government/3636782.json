            "background": "Allow more stringent checks on background suitability. Then to allow possession of any sporting or target firearm for use at Police approved locations (i.e. where suitable backstops exist to prevent over travel) in the UK suitable for the caliber of gun. Any contravention should immediately examine the individual AND Police enforcement of the rules, with both being liable to prosecution if fault is identified.\n\nThis will be a recognition that legally held firearms are NOT responsible for increased gun crime, and that larger calibre guns do NOT represent greater risk than small calibers which are less likely to give clean humane kills on game. The caliber should NOT be associated with the type of quarry, as this is irrelevant. Eg: A Rabbit shot with a .22 or a .45 is equally dead and is less likely to be wounded by the .45.\n\nThis is in the interest of sporting/target fraternity, and to the benefit of the public in ensuring greater security.",
