            "background": "I think it is about time the government had a capping system for immigrants using the legal aid system coming out of the tax payers pocket. I think it is about time that after a failed case and a failed appeal that should be it. Legal aid should be withdrawn and money to be stopped being wasted. I can't be the irritated person reading the press about how much lawyers are making from the backs of hard working tax payers to people who aren't even citizens of this country. I would rather see the money being spent on pensions, schools and healthcare.",
