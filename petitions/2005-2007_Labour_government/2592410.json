Currently the flag consists of the crosses of Sts George, Andrew and Patrick, but not the cross of St. David. This is highly unacceptable. I can see why it wasn't on the flag 300 yeas ago, because Wales was a part on England, but that has not been the case for many decades, and here in the 21st Century it is high time that Wales was represented on the Union flag. Wales is not run by England, like what some people think; it is part of the UK, just like England, Scotland and Northern Ireland.\n\nI would like the Prime Minister to put the cross of St. David (it's a yellow cross on a black background) on the Union flag.",
