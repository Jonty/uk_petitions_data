        "background": "We are constantly bombarded with headlines and stories about crime and criminals. The media draw attention to any offence, no matter how small, with regular calls for increasingly harsh and ever-lasting punishment.\n\nLots of people make one mistake, resulting in a single conviction. Punishments imposed by the courts are served without question or complaint. Many of these offenders later live perfect, law-abiding lives. There are numerous ex-criminals who have a single conviction dating from many years previously.\n\nDespite this, many are subject to double punishment, with insurance companies constantly refusing cover for the most basic protections such as home contents or motor insurance. Without such cover, it is often impossible to lead a law-abiding and productive life.\n\nI hereby petition the Prime Minister to prohibit the refusal of basic insurance cover to rehabilitated offenders with unspent criminal convictions dating from, for example, more than five years previously.",
