            "background": "Exeter City Council have just announced that the old Debenhams building in Exeter is likely to be spared demolition once the store relocates to its new premises in the Princesshay development.\nThe building displays all of the worst features of 60's architecture.  This could be overlooked were it not for the sheer size of the it; the building dominates the view of the City Centre from almost every viewpoint.  Exeter has a fantastic cathedral, yet the first building your eye settles on when you cast your view over the city is Debenhams, in all its drab, rectalinear concrete glory.\nLet's send a message to the Council that we don't want this building to dominate our city anymore.",
