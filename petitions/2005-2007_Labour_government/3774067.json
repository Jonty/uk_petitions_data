        "background": "The plural of Smurf should be, in my humble opinion, Smurves and not Smurfs.  After all, a one-legged donkey has only one hoof, whereas a donkey with the standard number of legs would have four hooves.  The same applies to calf and calves.  So a gaggle (or whatever) of Smurfs should\nbe SMURVES and not Smurfs!  QED!\n\nSmurf children should be called Smurflings, obviously, and a plural of Smurfette is irrelevent as she is unique, having been created by the wicked Gargamel (interestingly enough, as a short-haired brunette originally) to sow discontent amongst the Smurves, until discovered unhappy and alone in the forest by a Smurf (I forget which one) and being taken to the Smurf village and magically changed to a happy blonde by Papa Smurf.  Of course, everyone knows this.",
