However, the Welsh National Assembly is offering reimbursment of \u00a31800 to Welsh students studying in Wales, effectively creating a two-tier system and offering Welsh students a much lower financial burden for their degree.\n\nWill the Prime Minister pledge to address this urgent situation and ensure that a two-tier situation for students will not be created?",
