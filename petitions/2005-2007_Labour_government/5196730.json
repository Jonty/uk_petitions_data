At first, I and other people thought it was a joke logo, but it turns out that somedbody actually decided the logo was appropriate and authorized it. This person should be sacked. I could have knocked up that logo in under two minutes and I'm sure the thousands spent designing it (if you can call it that) could have been better spent elsewhere. It's far too hard to understand it and it is a total embarrassment. Every radio station has said it is an embarrassing joke and I and everyone else I have spoken to, agrees.",
