            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Each driver that tailgaits applies their brakes regularly and causes a domino effect, they apply their brakes for seconds this builds to minutes.  Junction blockers who creep through the light for fear of having to wait a few minutes more cause grid lock.  Those drivers with bad lane discipline effectively rule out the use of the first and sometimes the second lane on motorways this worsens the congestion.  Let the Government explore this thoroughly before persecuting good drivers by congestion charges.",
