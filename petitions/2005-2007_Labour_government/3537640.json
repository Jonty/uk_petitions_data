            "background": "Cut the budget used on CCTV cameras which are not necessary (for example inside university lecture rooms and residence halls); even though some of the cameras will help the citizens feel safe, a great amount of CCTVs in public places have no other use than to control what the people are doing. Instead, use part of the CCTV budget to help the NHS reduce the damage caused by its 650 million pound debt (service cuts, declining quality of hospitals, job cuts, etc).",
