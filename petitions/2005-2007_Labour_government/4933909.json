            "background": "It seems harsh that individuals suffering from e.g. dementia or Alzheimer's are disenfranchised. Those who may act in their financial/economic interests cannot vote on their behalf. This means that some 700 000 Alzheimer's sufferers are denied direct political say. This is wrong. Extend the vote to those lacking mental capacity by means of proxy voting.",
