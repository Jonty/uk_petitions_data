            "background": "It would appear that children have no human rights when it comes to religion. They are brainwashed into religion at faith schools and have no redress against such. All children should have an education that incorporates generalizations on all religions as well as agnostic arguments against them.It is also important to tell them why people need, or do not need such beleifs thereby giving them a more rounded view of others.Let children make their own minds up as to which religion is for them when they are more informed and old enough to comprehend. Create academic NOT religious schools.",
