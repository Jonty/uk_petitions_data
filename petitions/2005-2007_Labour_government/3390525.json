            "background": "I ask the Prime Minister to improve the rights and security of private domestic tenants. Increasingly unaffordable house pricing means house renters are now becoming more numerous. Further legislation is required to improve the rights and security of this growing population as they are far too exposed to the whimsical financial and domestic arrangements of those in the private buy to let sector. The welfare of this section of the population cannot, and must not, be entrusted to an unstable and fickle investment housing sector that, potentially, have no care for anyone else's affairs but their own. Amateur property 'tycoons' cannot be trusted to act in a socially responsible manner.   A failure to act now will result in a transient and unstable population with little security and confidence. This will impact upon the social health of our nation. Tenants need security to build worthwhile lives. The children of those families will not flourish under uncertainty and transience.",
