Joint accounts are being used to con the victims out of money, the law says that husbands & wives cannot be done for duress & undue influence, but that is what these people do, this law has to change regarding this, this should not be a civil matter, but a criminal one. The marriage is a con, therefore the con artist is using the marriage to get away with this type of crime.",
