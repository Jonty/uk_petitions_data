            "background": "The legal aid system was created to help people who found themselves going to court and unable to pay for a legal advisor to defend them. It was not created to help repeat criminals escape justice. Why should the taxpayer pay for career criminals to have \"free\" legal advice? A solution would be to allow each person to use the system, for example, four times (which would cover most law abiding citizens) then charge 10 percent of the cost for the 5th time, 20 percent for the 6th ...etc, so that eventually (after the 14th time) the repeat criminals would have to pay ALL the legal fees. (or defend themselves!!) Some \"Do-gooder\" may well say, \"It'll be an abuse of their human rights if do that\". What about the human rights of all the honest population of The United Kingdom?",
