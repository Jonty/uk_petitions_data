            "background": "I left school 47 years ago, but now find that I am subjected to more rules and unwanted supervision as a mature adult citizen than ever was reasonably required to guide a minor. \nI also thought that the days of being kept in detention with the whole school for the misdemeanors of the few were over. Not so. For example: it is easy to reduce all drivers speed to under 25MPH by an economically and socially ruinous blanket speed limit which also provides unlimited opportunities for fine revenue, but it is difficult to target the few speeding drivers whom the authorities say they wish to target - if only they would.\nI pay my taxes, of which there are too many,when due. Why therefore do I have to be admonished by the Treasury night after night for self employed tax returns or TV licence payment. Target the miscreants, not me.",
