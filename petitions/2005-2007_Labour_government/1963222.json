If they have another job working for a company in whatever capacity they are not devoting their time to what they should be doing \u2013 making this country a better place to live in. Saying that an MP does a full days work and only does extra in the evenings/weekends for another company is no excuse either. No one can work effectively under those conditions. Their wage is more than adequete to live on and does not need topping up. An MP being associated with a company is morally wrong and harms their constituency.",
