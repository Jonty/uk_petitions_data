            "background": "Since time began, the Sabbath has been a Special Day, created by God as a Day of Rest. He rested from His labours in creating the world on that first Sabbath, and has instructed mankind throughout Scripture to observe this special day as a day of rest.\n\nMankind was made to enjoy work, but the need for rest is great. The Sabbath or Lord\u2019s Day is given to us as a special day on which to rest from our own labours and to take time to worship God and engage only in holy activities.\n\nTo open shops, family entertainment centres and other leisure places on a Sunday is in direct conflict with the Fourth Commandment, which states, \u201cRemember the Sabbath day to keep it holy\u201d. \n\nIt is a command to mankind, not a request, and we ignore and disobey it at our peril!\n\nI urge the Prime Minister to repeal Sunday Trading laws to prohibit such trading and encourage the nation to obey God\u2019s commandments.\n\nKeep Sunday Special!",
