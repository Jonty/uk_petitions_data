            "background": "The results of public research are typically published in peer review journals. However these journals alone are insufficient to ensure reproducibility. Therefore for all publicly funded research the government should collect and make public the experimental method used to collect data, the unprocessed data collected, a description on how the data was processed (including either a detailed description of the algorithms or the program source code of any automated processing) and the conclusions drawn. In short all the information needed to repeat the experiments and analysis. This would serve as both a way for scientists working with public money to be held accountable and a way for scientists to publish the methods and data behind their research.",
