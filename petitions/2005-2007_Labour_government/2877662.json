Now we live in dread of bird flu tranferring to humans and causing a pandemic. Transfer of the infective organisms on unwashed hands is a major vector.\n\nThere have been campaigns to improve hygeine by additional hand washes in hospital wards and care homes, supplemented by the provision of alcohol gel for hand rubs.\n\nIn this scenario, it is time to ban the handling (with bare hands) of cooked food by kitchen staff, done mainly for reasons of presentation, in professional restaurants and as seen in many 'chef' programmes on TV.",
