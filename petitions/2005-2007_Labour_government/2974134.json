            "background": "The continued development of Trident threatens both the Nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty and world stability. It will cost the tax payer around \u00a3100 billion over the next 50 years. Each Trident submarine can launch a potential 192 warheads each of which can deliver a destructive blast 8 times that of Hiroshima - and thats without the massive numbers of people, animals and plant life which would be destroyed by nuclear radiation. Almost all the parts are designed, sourced or leased from or by the US. With the Soviet Union gone, the veil of deterrence Trident was hiding behind has vanished. It's time to take Trident off patrol.",
