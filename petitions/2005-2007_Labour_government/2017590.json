            "background": "There is currently no A&E in northern Sussex. The towns of Horsham and Crawley and several others are obliged to travel many miles to hospitals in Redhill or Brighton in the event of an emergency. \nPease Pottage village has excellent road access on the junction of A23 and M23. The nearby London Gatwick Airport is on the direct route to Pease Pottage, in case of serious need. \nIt is estimated that 45,000 people will move to the area in the next 10 years and these people will have no hospital, in addition to the hundreds of thousands of people already resident in this area.\nWith hospital services closing across West Sussex, notably in Haywards Heath, Worthing and Chichester, a new hospital is urgently needed, and the Government must step in and help as the Surrey & Sussex NHS trust cannot.",
