At present the \"Closed List\" system allows the political parties to determine the order of the lists.  Someone placed at the top of a list by the Conservative or Labour parties is almost certain to be elected with the people having no choice.   The people should be able, not only to vote for a Party but also for the individuals within the Party.",
