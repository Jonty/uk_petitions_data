        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Why should the elderly use their hard earned money to fund their care. They are in a care home because they are sick or infirmed. They are made to sell their homes to cover the cost of this care, if they were a much younger person and say were involved in a car accident (which may have been their fault) they would not be asked to sell their home to fund the care they would get from the NHS. IT IS TIME OUR OLD FOLKS WERE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST AND THIS GOVERNMENT CAN DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. Please sign this petition.",
