            "background": "The current situation with Local Education Authorities setting the school holidays, particularly where a number L.E.A.s are close to each other, means that it is possible for a family to have children in different L.E.A. and there be different dates for the holidays, so making it difficult for families to take a holiday without taking children out of school time and make child care provision, especially for single parent families.  The situation is even worse where the parent(s) are teachers in different authorities from their partners and children.  Setting the holidays centrally would go a long way to improving the situation.",
