            "background": "It is known some councils encourage tenants to remove themselves from council listed properties with large amounts of money from the public purse (tax payers money). This is sureley wrong. Residents should be made to save like anyone else in private renting; to arrange mortgages. They should not be put in the advantageous position of having a nice large deposit from public funds. Most people and young workers leaving the family home will not have this GIFT from the tax payers purse and are therefore being discriminated against in the private housing market inflated by this GIFT systetm, they can be some \u00a350,000 poorer than these council tenants. Unless of course we all encourage our offspring to 'obtain by legal means the  most points the STATE and Councils require to get them into council housing, to then get them off to a good start in life!",
