            "background": "The detainment camp at Guantanemo Bay has been continually condemned by human rights organisations. Reports suggest that detainees are subjected to torture. Only 10 prisoners have been formally charged, and none have been brought to trial, five years after the prison opened. The Prime Minister should make clear his strong and unequivocal opposition to this situation, and do everything in his power to bring about an end to it.\n\nEight UK residents are currently being held in the camp. Many of them have families who are UK citizens and had been granted leave to reside in the UK, but the government has refused to intervene on their behalf on the basis that they are not British citizens. The government should also take action to return these men to British jurisdiction, where they can face any criminal charges that have been made against them.",
