            "background": "In the UK at present, different types of income are taxed at different rates. Employment income is taxed at the highest basic rate; read below to see how it works. Each figure represents the starting, basic and higher rates of tax:\n\nEmployment at 10%, 22%, 40%; Dividends at 10%(notional), no basic , 32.%; Interest at 10%, 20%, 40%; Capital Gains at 10%, 20%, 40%. \n\nThese differentials enable people who live on interest and dividend income to pay less tax than those in full-time jobs. A very noticeable feature is that dividend income is not taxed at all below \u00a333,300 and only at 32.5% not 40% in the higher rate band. \n\nIf people work for their own companies, by paying themselves a very low wage (usually just over the personal allowance threshold), they  pay very little national insurance and tax and still are entitled to a full state pension upon retirement!  If you think these anomolies need to be removed to create a more equitable system of taxation  then sign this petition NOW!",
