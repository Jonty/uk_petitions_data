        "background": "People who do not work get financial and housing help. So do many immigrants. Many of us - even single parents do not get this sort of help because we work. If you are on a low wage or a single parent you struggle as much as the people who get help. Why is it that my kids dont get as much for their child trust fund because I work? It dosen't mean I can afford to give them any more. Shall I not work to get the full \u00a3500 for my children? My kids got \u00a3250 because I work!!?? I cant afford a mortgage on my own, but still get put in housing that people who dont work get put in and then my kids have to grow up with these. Is it any wonder why there is so much domestic violence? There is no where for these women to go. I mean who would want to go from owning a property to going to council. It's not snobby it's just unfair. Please sign all you hard working people who want to give yourselves and children so much but just fall at the first hurdle.",
