            "background": "Typically, healthier food products are more expensive than their non-healthy equivalents. For example, tinned baked beans without salt are more expensive than beans with added salt. This petition urges the Prime Minister to introduce measures that would outlaw the sale at a higher price by a single manufacturer of a food product than its non-healthy equivalent and to consider the introduction of additional taxes that would make high fat/high sugar products more expensive than healthier equivalents. Green taxes encourage us to but environmentally friendly products; we need a food equivalent to make it cost effective to buy healthy.",
