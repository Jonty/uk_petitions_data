            "background": "We call on Mr Blair to encourage David Murray of Rangers Football Club to take a harder approach against those who make obsence gestures and chants against other people. Those who make such gestures should not only be banned from the ground but given education on diversity where possible to encourage them to stop their extreme behaviour which cannot be tolerated just because of their religious beleifs. We accept this is a small minority of Rangers fans but feel the government has not done enough to oppose this behaviour. Jack McConnell has already attempted to tackle this subject, but it has been largely ignored by Tony Blair who should not limit his concern to just English issues.",
