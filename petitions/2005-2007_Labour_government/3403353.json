            "background": "The recent upsurge in violent crimes and killings in Kenya, especially Nairobi has had a negative impact on the country's image. It has always been a peaceful & hospitable country with strong values, but recent events have forced tourists and investors to look elsewhere.\nWith over 100,000 brits visiting Kenya each year, it's in our interest as well as the Commonwealth's interest, to keep Kenya as it's always been. A peaceful law abiding country. The Kenyan Government seems to be struggling & would need some help. Not financially, but by providing adequate training to its security forces, and this would help bring the 'green city in the sun' back to its glory.",
