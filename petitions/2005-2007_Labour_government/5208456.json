This logo is not only embarrassing, but it portrays our country in the worst possible way. \n\nThe original London 2012 Logo was better by far. We need a new logo now, or at least a return to the old one!\n\nHaving read the general public's comments about this, I will have to add that I think that a childrens competition, possibly one run by a programme such as BBC's Blue Peter, would find a logo that would portray the London Olympics in a much better way, and cost much less than \u00a3400,000!",
