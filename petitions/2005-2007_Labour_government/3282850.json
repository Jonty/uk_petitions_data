            "background": "At present, if anyone is, or believes to be mistreated by any secret society, the only place to investigate this claim is via the police. It's common knowledge that a high percentage of policemen are freemasons, especially further up the ladder so it's unlikely that an individual is going to get the justice they deserve. It would be totally unacceptable if paediaphiles were in charge of an invesigation into child abuse so why can't genuine victims be given a place to have their claims investigated?",
