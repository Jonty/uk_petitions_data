In view of this situation it seems sensible to bring the start of BST to Easter weekend to allow people to enjoy the Easter weekend evenings. (There are a variety of views about when BST should start, or whether it should run year-round. This is merely intended to deal with the situation which, almost without precedent and with no recurrence due for many years, occurs in 2008.)",
