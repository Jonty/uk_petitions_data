At present bus fares in London are \u00a32, \u00a31 for those with Oyster cards and 50p for Students. Despite studying at University and living in London for nearly 6months of the year we are forced to pay double that of students within London, who may spend the same duration here. \nI myself have lived in the capital all my life, and my family has paid increased London council tax for the past 20 years or so of living here, yet as I have chosen to spend four years studying elsewhere, on returning home I feel foreign to the city of my birth.\nThis classification of ourselves needs to be addressed for financial and principal reasons.",
