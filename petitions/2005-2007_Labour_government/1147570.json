I have met with quite a few close shaves where the bicycle has met me and my 2 German Shepherds on the blind bend of 2 streets and one of my dogs hates cyclists! Now if my dog were to react inappropriately to the cyclist/bike on the FOOTpath, who would get in the most trouble?!!?\nAnd all I get is a mouthful of abuse from the cyclist.",
