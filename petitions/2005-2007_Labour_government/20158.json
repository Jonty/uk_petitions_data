        "background": "I welcome with open arms, the governments legislation to ban smoking in public places, but it needs to go further.  I often inhale the cigarette smoke of people in the street walking in front of me.  I choose not to go into bars that I know are going to be very smokey, but I cannot choose which streets I walk to work and so on.  I have seen the same problem with people standing at bus stops.",
