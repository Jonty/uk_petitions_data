As our static is worth less than \u00a35,000 we feel it is unfair to charge us as if our property was worth the Band A amount.\n\nWe hope that at some time in the near future this forgotten part of the banding will be put right in fairness to all those people who are property owners but the property is of little value.  Thank you.",
