            "background": "Allow Faith Adoption Societies to do their skilled work according to their consciences. They are aware of the identity problems which many adopted children face, on a life-long basis. The children's needs must come first, and one adoption format does not fit all socially, any more than it does racially. Equal opportunities in adoption means putting the  child's needs first, and the needs of  adults should be considered second to this tenet. It is against religious freedom to force Faith Societies to assess Gay people for adoption, though Gay people can be assessed by any of the many Social Services Departments. Faith Societies have, since 1920s, cared about the rights of vulnerable children, and respected the right of relinquishing parents to ask for their children to be given a religious upbringing. Now, parents who are often disadvantaged will have lost even that small say in their children's future, and the child, some link to kin.\nPlease allow the Faith Adoption societies to continue to assess adopters in line with the needs of the children whose families have asked for a particular setting for their child.",
