            "background": "British citizens who have chosen to emigrate to another country upon retirement in order to re unite with their family for example are discriminated against if they move to a Commonwealth Country. They  have paid into the British old age pension plan in the same amounts as every one else but find that its indexing feature has been frozen as soon as they move to that country. This seems grossly unfair when in a large number of countries such as the United States British pensions are automatically indexed as they are in the United Kingdom. This would appear to be an extreme form of discrimination without any apparent reason. Why is this anomaly being allowed to continue when other forms of unfair treatment are being actively discouraged by the present British government.\n\nPerrin L Hayes",
