            "background": "There is a new law set to come in that gives bailiffs the right to break into debtors homes and take goods. I think this new law should be stopped befor its even started as the person the bailiffs are after may not even live at the address they break into, vulnerable people to. And i cant belive that a bailiff would break into someones home and just take goods to cover the debt as alot of bailiffs are criminals, they are abusive and this new law would only make them worse.",
