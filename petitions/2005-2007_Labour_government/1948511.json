            "background": "Reverse currently operating & stop the creation of future traffic calming schemes. All law abiding motorists are currently being penalized & caused major inconvenience due to these schemes. These costly schemes are being introduced to slow down a minority of speeding motorists who should be dealt with by prosecution. With this countries dependancy on road transportation we should be opening up the road infrastructure in order to improve the flow of traffic not congesting it even further. The only way to calm traffic is to have calm drivers not irate drivers due to the delays caused by these schemes.   These schemes are also a nightmare for the emergency services who need obviously to reach their destination quickly & smoothly. The current use of road humps in some of these schemes is a major danger to patients with spinal injuries being transported by ambulance. Please get all local authorities to re think there commitment to these schemes.",
