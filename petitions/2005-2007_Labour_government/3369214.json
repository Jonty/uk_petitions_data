            "background": "Chard is a thriving market town of 12,000 people. It used to have two train stations, providing easy access for travellers to Taunton, London, Exeter and the South Coast.\nNot anymore - against the wishes of the people of Chard, both stations were closed in the notorious Beeching Cuts in the '60s.\nThe reopening of one of them, Chard Junction, is viable, necessary, and would be of great benefit to business, commuters and the town as a whole. The station itself lies on the London - Exeter line and is still very much in existence, it just isn't open to passengers.\nHow can a town of this size not have a train station? Without a train station, the people of Chard have no option but to use their cars.\nSo come on Mr Blair and Mr Alexander, give Chard back its train station!",
