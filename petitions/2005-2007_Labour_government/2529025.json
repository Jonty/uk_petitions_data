        "background": "The government already provides free bus passes to over 60's, the principal users of buses. In my local area 16 year olds have to pay \u00a31.80 for a 15 minute ride to Wigan. People of this age don't have the luxury of being able to drive, and rely on public transport. Theses buses are often overcrowded, mainly by pensioners, and so you may have to wait an hour for a bus. Either the government should give free bus passes to under 18's or make pensioners pay to use the bus. This way the overall charge will decrease, or there will be more money to pay for new buses and provide a more reliable transport service. Then less people will use their cars, less traffic and no need for these new car taxes. Overall there will be a decrease in gas emissions. Taadaa!",
