            "background": "The Wimborne Green changing from Cricket Pitch to Traders Pitch!\nWe already have a large supermarket that is very much under-subscribed in the town centre just yards away from this proposed development.\n This is not a development that Wimborne has sought.  The town is forced to consider this development because the owner of the land \u2013 Sir Michael Hanham, wishes to realize a cash asset.The proposed structure is wholly out of keeping with Wimborne and will mar the view of the Minster when approaching the town from the East \u2013 visual pollution!\nThe 200 jobs 'promised' by Waitrose will be outnumbered by the number of jobs lost in local businesses.  Although Waitrose distributes its profits amongst its employees, the bulk of the money that it takes will be drained from the local economy.\nThe supermarket will generate some 2500 additional vehicles transiting the narrow roads of the town centre each day, 7 days a week \u2013 atmospheric pollution.",
