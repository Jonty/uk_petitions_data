        "action": "create a new union for the UK (UNE - UNITED NOTHERN EUROPE)!!! I suggest a new union to catch the eyes of our youths for support, as we do need to be in some sort of union for the UK to survive.Only have the UK, Norway, Sweden and Denmark as members as these are the only eurosceptic kingdoms in the EU and are not completely part of all the EU subjects, The difference between this union and the EU is it would be a success, all theses  countries have high HDI and economies and all have compulsory English taught in schools, so language wouldn\u2019t be a problem like in the EU.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Lets face the facts that the UK is a eurosceptic country as the rest or northern Europe because we all have monarchy\u2019s and are not on the mainland of the continent, we simply don\u2019t feel European and don\u2019t want to give our sovereignty up. Like the other European kingdoms Spain and the Benelux e.g. them being pro-European and say for instance being part of the euro while the other nothern kingdoms are not. This union would also keep these states feeling comfortable and pro knowing no republics are trying to erase them, and would allow them to keep their own currencies. This union could do every think else the EU does from Common Agricultural/ Fisheries Policy, Police and Judicial Co-operation in Criminal Matters, European Communities and free to move immigration from these countries would be extremely more popular than the EU immigration. Another key element to eurosceptism is new members like the EU has, this union would not have that, it would have its members set from the start.",
