Professional organisations are simply self serving, protectionist organisations that should have no authority to dictate to the general public, who or who may not use a generic term of the English language. The term \u201cEngineer\u201d has been used for hundreds of years, for many purposes. What right does a private organisation have that allows it to hijack a public property word for their own private use, simply because they assert that their definition of the word should be the correct, and only used one?",
