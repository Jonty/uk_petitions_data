        "background": "As a B.Sc qualified Electronics Engineer of 25 years, I, and millions of other similarly well qualified engineers have no desire to toe the line by joining elitist, clique organisations that only represent a vocal minority, simply to use the term \u201cEngineer\u201d in our professional job title. Professional organisations are simply self serving, protectionist organisations that should have no authority to dictate to the general public, who or who may not use a generic term of the English language. The term \u201cEngineer\u201d has been used for hundreds of years, for many purposes. What right does a private organisation have that allows it to hijack a public property word for their own private use, simply because they assert that their definition of the word should be the correct, and only used one?",
