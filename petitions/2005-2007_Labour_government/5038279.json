They spread disease and displace our smaller land birds, attack humans, and cause extensive damage to vehicle paintwork through their ammonia rich guano.\nI propose that the feeding of all sea birds be made a criminal offence, that a yearly cull be organised by councils, and that all protection for these creatures be removed more than 100m inland from our coastline.",
