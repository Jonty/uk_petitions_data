We as a first world country and former colonial power need to be at the forefront of this and we need to convince other countries to do the same. We can no longer stand back and watch Africa suffer. We need drastic action to help the continent out of the situation it\u2019s in; a situation in many ways is partly our fault due to our rushed exit after colonization and many countries just haven\u2019t been able to recover.",
