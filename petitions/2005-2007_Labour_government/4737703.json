        "background": "Africa is an extremely poor continent and, we as first world countries, should do our bit and show our humanity by dropping all debt to the African continent especially the poorest countries and the one\u2019s most hit by famine drought and genocide. We as a first world country and former colonial power need to be at the forefront of this and we need to convince other countries to do the same. We can no longer stand back and watch Africa suffer. We need drastic action to help the continent out of the situation it\u2019s in; a situation in many ways is partly our fault due to our rushed exit after colonization and many countries just haven\u2019t been able to recover.",
