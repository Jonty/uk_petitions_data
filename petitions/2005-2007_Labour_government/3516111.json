        "background": "Want to study art?You will be required to complete an Art Foundation before enrolling on your BA.The Foundation is a one year course where students opt to experiment in a wide range of art disciplines before choosing a specialism.It is an important year+very exciting.The big downfall about the current  Art Foundations status is that it is recognised as Further Education +not Higher.This means there is a lack of any student loan +unlike before,no grant.These courses vary in quality and differ greatly in the range of options available.It makes moving across the country+finding the course modules you want to study a huge strain on students from low income backgrounds.Foundation students from low income backgrounds are entitled to EMA+a hard funds bursary, it does help but it doesn't cover every need..accomodation!I wonder why art foundation courses are considered FE+not HE? Please re-introduce the grant or change the Foundation from FE to HE so we can claim a loan+crack on with our art.",
