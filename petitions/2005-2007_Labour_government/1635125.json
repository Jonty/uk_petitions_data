        "background": "I have found it very difficult to find out exactly what happens to everything that I 'recycle'.  Garden waste and compost, for example, is collected by a dedicated rubbish truck, and apparently then taken to a landfill site.  Councils need to be open about where materials for recycling go, and should be aiming above and beyond their targets.",
