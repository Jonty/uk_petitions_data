        "background": "One of the reasons that there are so many poor government decisions and so many misguided public investment projects is that the people advising the government and taking decisions are not qualified to make those decisions. In Germany you are not allowed to do a job unless you are formally qualified in the area in which you are operating. That is you have received some training in the area in which you wish to operate. This simple rule would greatly increase the economic success of the United Kingdom",
