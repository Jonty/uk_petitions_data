            "background": "In May 1995 Gedun Choekyi Nyima, the six-year-old boy identified by His Holiness the Dalai Lama as the 11th Panchen Lama, disappeared. Suspicions that he had been kidnapped were confirmed in May 1996 when the Chinese leadership admitted to holding him and his family in \"protective custody.\" After repeated attempts to gain access to the boy, no international agencies or human rights organizations (including the United Nations) have been allowed to visit Gedun Choekyi Nyima or his family, and their condition remains uncertain\nThe Chinese government have selected their own Panchen Lama which undermines the Tibetan people, their religion and their nation. This petition is to appeal to the Chinese government to release the 11th Panchen Lama and his family immediately and so that he can be given the right monastic education. Thankyou",
