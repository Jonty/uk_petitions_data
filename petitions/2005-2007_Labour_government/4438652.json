        "background": "In 1997 Gordon Brown initiated a raid on pension funds to the tune of \u00a35 billion per year. In the intervening nine years the UK's pension funds have been mugged of \u00a345 billion. When he took over as Chancellor, GB inherited a situation where UK pension schemes were the envy of the world. They are now the laughing stock and many, many people have seen (or are seeing) their retirement plans go up in smoke. This petition asks the Prime Minister to rescind this damaging legislation and refund the shortfalls it has created.",
