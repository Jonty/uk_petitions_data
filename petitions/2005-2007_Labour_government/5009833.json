They are coming to live in this country and instantly receiving benefits of one form or another. In most cases making it difficult or impossible for British citizens to receive NHS treatments and receive benefits. British citizens have been paying taxes and national insurance for a lot of years and now immigrants are benefitting from this. Double all immigrants contributions to go some way towards catching up on the amount British people have paid.",
