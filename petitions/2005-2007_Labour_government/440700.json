        "action": "Legalise licensed prostitution and licensed brothel keeping",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Since long before the tragic Ipswich murders, women (and men) have put their safety at risk by selling their bodies for money. Whilst it is accepted that many are forced into the industry through economic or other needs, nevertheless people should be free to choose this profession (of their own free will) and to work within the industry in safety.\n\nIt is proposed to legalise licensed prostitution and brothel keeping, in suitable areas, providing sex workers with safety and an opportunity to offer them help to overcome the factors that have made them choose the industry if they wish to leave it.  Sex workers should be regularly health screened to maintain their individual licence, Brothel Keepers subject to similar licensing laws and screening as the drinks and gaming industries, and the proceeds of the industry taxed whilst maintaining the illegality of public solicitation, kerb crawling and unlicensed prostitution or brothel keeping.",
