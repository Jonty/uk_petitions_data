            "background": "It would seem to me that now that Wlaes, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their devolved parliament, we in England are at a disadvantage. Scotland have voted for their University Students to retain grants so that they are not burdened with the debt of our student; Wales have voted for free prescriptions while everyone else has to pay but it seems to me that there is no one to speak up for those in England - the same MPs in London have votes in their respective countries parliaments and in ours: therefore the Scots vote for grants in Scotland but for fees in England for students and so on, the same with prescription charges in Wales. We need also maybe a devolved sub-parliament of the MP's in the English Constituencies to speak up for England.",
