            "background": "Hollywood Park Combined Nursery, is a pre-school nursery in Stockport. OFSTED have classed the nursery as \"Outstanding in every way\". Stckport council, have just announced without consultation of parents, staff and school governors that as of July this year, it is to be \"Relocated\". In other words, they wish to close it, citing that the building is unsafe, and too costly to repair. Both these facts are untrue. Therefore, we the Parents, Staff, Governors, and pupils past and present, petition the Prime Minister to intervene and stop this absurd decision ever taking place. It is a centre of excellence, and if the closure happens, our children who attend now, and those who will attend in the future, will suffer.",
