        "action": "Force all financial institutions (banks, finance and credit companies etc.) to repay all charges levied against consumers in the last 6 years",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The situation of illegal punitive charges levied by banks, credit card companies, lenders and other such companies is now out of control.  \n\nCommon Law and the Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts Regulations make it illegal for companies to make a profit on charges levied against their customers for breaches of contract (such as bouncing a cheque or having insufficient funds to clear a direct debit).\n\nOver the past couple of years thousands of consumers have taken legal action against these companies in order to have their illegal charges reimbursed.  To date the banks and other companies responsible for these illegal practices have reimbursed over \u00a310 million in out of court settlements.\n\nIt is time the Government forced -all- companies who have levied illegal charges against British consumers, to repay these charges with interest, immediately and without the consumers being required to undergo the laborious and stressful task of starting legal proceedings against the relevant parties.  This should be an automatic refund.",
