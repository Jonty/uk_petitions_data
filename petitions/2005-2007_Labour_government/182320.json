One way to do this is to have a favourable taxation structure which will allow that development of infrastructure and encourage manufacurers of both the vehicles and the bio fuels to invest. Time is running out and we are barely sacatching the surface in the use of bio fuels as part of the carbon footprint reduction.\nThis government needs to put its money where its mouth is.",
