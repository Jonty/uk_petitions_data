Four million infants, children and mothers die every year from lung infections caused by breathing toxic smoke. Millions more succumb to diseases caused by tainted water and spoiled food \u2013 simply because there is no electricity to purify water or refrigerate food. Their families can only dream of a better future, because without abundant, affordable electricity there is no hope or opportunity.",
