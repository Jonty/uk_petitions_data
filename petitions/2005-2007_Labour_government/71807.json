        "background": "We need a Law which the police +/or the Local Authorities in the UK can enforce - to prevent people from spitting in public places and encourage Local Authorities and public transport organisations (trains, tubes, buses, coaches) to put up signs which would remind people not to spit. The increase of TB, Hepatitis C and Meningitis is a national concern, especially for the most vulnerable in our society i.e. children in buggies and people in wheelchairs especially manual wheelchair users. The disease is picked up by wheels, onto hands, into mouths and into the human system, then spread from families into the community. Meningitis lies dormant for +/- 50 years. Please take one small step to stop an epidemic which could affect the world",
