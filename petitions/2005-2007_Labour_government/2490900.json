Thus ensuring that serious matters requiring the Royal Perogative remain the responsibility of The Sovereign.\nThe right to declare War falls under the Royal perogative as a significant example, and should be returned to The Sovereign. Thus accountability for actions requiring The Royal perogative would reside and remain with The Royal Sovereign.",
