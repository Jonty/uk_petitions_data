        "background": "The Royal perogative is now in the hands of The Prime Minister and His Government, not the current Sovereign.\nThe Royal perogative should be returned to The Sovereign absolutely. Thus ensuring that serious matters requiring the Royal Perogative remain the responsibility of The Sovereign.\nThe right to declare War falls under the Royal perogative as a significant example, and should be returned to The Sovereign. Thus accountability for actions requiring The Royal perogative would reside and remain with The Royal Sovereign.",
