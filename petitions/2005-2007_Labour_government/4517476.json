But I have a theory, please read it. here is the link, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Vampire#How_to_fight_vampires\n\nIt is under the heading: Vampires are haemavores, I have a perfectly logical and scientific explanation, etc. and it is signed as ~Fraz~, aka myself.\n\nI simply ask the consideration of a law or civil rights act against the discrimination, and cruelty towards these most wonderful people, who suffer with this virus. or at least a programme designed to educate British citizens of the reality, and cruelty towards what we ignorantly refer to as \"vampires\". Please sign this if you agree with fair treatment to all.",
