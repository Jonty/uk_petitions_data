            "background": "Domestic abuse, according to hundreds of studies from around the world and including Britain, affects men and women in equal numbers. Yet the government has suppressed these facts and focussed only on female victims. This means that where women have 500 refuges supported by the government, males have no where to go with their children when they are attacked. This is sexist and wrong and we petition the prime minister to end this practice of discrimination by making services and funds available to protect both genders.",
