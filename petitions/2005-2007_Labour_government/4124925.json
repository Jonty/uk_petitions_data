        "background": "The magazine given with my Sunday paper had a very harrowing story about a young woman who might have died from cervical cancer, or at least had to undergo a hysterectomy, if these new guildelines had been in force when she was 23.  The smear she had then showed severe abnormalities which would have developed into cancer if they hadn't been detected.  I myself have had two semars showing pre-cancerous cells; I hate to think what might have happened to me if these had not been detected, and dealt with, in time.  As the young woman in my magazine points out: there is a 99% link between cervical cancer and sex so why, when the age of consent is 16, are women denied smears until they're 25?",
