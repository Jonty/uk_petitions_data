        "background": "In addition to getting salaries many times the national average, so executives are getting christmas bonuses worth more than the average UK worker will earn in a lifetime. Certain types of worker get most of the bonuses while those providing supporting roles essential to the performance of the company do not get anywhere near the same benefits.\n\nThere should be some regulation to ensure that a few workers do not get the majority of the money, while those that have worked equally hard in other areas of the company get nothing. Regulation should be put in place to encourage companies to pay a more uniform bonus - for example, each person gets the same percentage of their salary as a bonus, or each person gets the same amount of bonus, so either all workers will receive a proportionate bonus, or they will all receive an equal one.",
