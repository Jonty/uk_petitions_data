            "background": "Stephen Colbert is the quintessential American Hero whose speech at the White House Correspondent's Dinner so pleased George W Bush. In the spirit of our Special Relationship with the States, we feel he deserves his place on British television. For too long More4 have edited him out of The Daily Show and refused to screen his The Colbert Report altogether. His segment was even cut out of the Emmy Awards broadcast. It's clearly anti-American bias at work and a heinous ban has been imposed on Colbert purely for his political views.\n\nWe, the British members of the Colbert Nation (for there are many), petition the Prime Minister to get Stephen Colbert on our television screens and end this victimisation. Let us provide political asylum to this leader of men.",
