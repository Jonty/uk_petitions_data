            "background": "The Issue:\nMany drivers in the UK have become incapable of driving correctly on multiple lane carriageways. To avoid 'becoming stuck' in the left lane (or in other words, having to think about driving) they roadhog the middle/right lane. As a consequence the right lane becomes the most occupied lane as drivers are forced to overtake the roadhogs, followed by the middle lane with the left lane being occupied almost exclusively by slower cars and lorries etc.\n\nThe Solution:\n#Place signs on carriageways that encourage drivers to 'Keep Left Unless Overtaking'.\n#Publicise the fact that 'passing on the left' is legal. \n#Legalise undertaking to alleviate the number of cars that are forced into an already congested right lane by road hogs.\n\nThe Precedent:\nIn many other countries (e.g. America/NZ) undertaking is legal with the addition of roadside signs advising drivers who aren't overtaking to \"Keep Left\".",
