            "background": "The UK is moving towards a police state similar but beyond the scope of the KGB.We have numerous types of surveillance mechanisms, aimed not at the criminals, but at every person in the country.We are all presumed guilty until proven otherwise. While the government statistics say the surveillance state is working and that we must pay the price for peace, by giving up our liberties, we know that once given, they will never be returned. \n\nWe are heading down a road where people will not be able to function, without giving allegiance to the police state. Technology is ready for possible compulsory human chip implants, when the other methods fail.Scifi movies are revealing the bondage yet to come and we would ask the government, to stop the madness before we reach the road of no return.",
