            "background": "Grid based software allows geographically distributed computing resources to work on the same project.  A PC can work on a small portion of research for data analysis purposes using processing power not being used by the user. This could be via a screen saver or just in the background. Given the growing use of PCs and access to the Internet, it must be possible to carry out vast amounts of data analysis. Oxford university used grid software to aid research in cancer via the internet. Other universities could use similar software to aid the analysis of results.",
