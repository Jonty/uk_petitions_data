        "background": "In 1974 Turkey invaded Northern Cyprus killing civilians and occupying land that was not theirs under the pretence that they were protecting the Turkish Cyrpits living on the island (5% of the island's population who were always well intergrated). Since then Turkey has shipped thousands of illegal settlers into the North in order to populate the island and ensure its claims could be validated.\n\nAt the beginning of the Iraq war Turkey threatened to invade northern Iraq to protect the the Turkmenistan people who are descended form the Turks. Coincidentally this threatened invasion into Northern Iraq would mean that the Kurdish reigion in the North would come under Turkish control.\n\nTurkish people are lovely but the Turkish government are aggressive and untrustworthy. Stop Turkish aggression. Support this appeal to make the PM aware of your concerns.",
