            "background": "There was never a speed limit on motorways (and on most A roads and dual carriageways). until 1974. This meant traffic found its own level and the traffic flowed. Apart from reducing accidents because the traffic is bunched, the absence of a speed limit will also significantly reduce congestion.\nThe current limit is about half of what the motorways were actually designed for.",
