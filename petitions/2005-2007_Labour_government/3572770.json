            "background": "Evidence shows that the DfES and some other government supported groups have created problems in the early years education of UK children aged 3-6 years.  This has resulted in poor standards of reading, writing, and mathematics in those children, which continues into further primary and secondary education, and beyond.  The National Curriculum is too rigid for children aged 3-6 years.  Successful models of education for children aged 3-6 years in other European countries should be introduced into the UK.",
