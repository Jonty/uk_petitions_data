            "background": "Primary school children are missing out on so much because they are being taught for tests and are just seen as statistics. Children should be enjoying their education, not stressing about whether or not they are going to get enough marks to move up a level. We are not letting them experience or enjoy life because we are teaching them that tests are all that matter. We set them up for failure, boredom and competition and then wonder why they are not able to communicate or smile. If we want them to carry on learning throughout life we need to give them a reason, purpose and sense of enjoyment from the start. We are not letting children be children. 4 year olds should be able to learn through play, not have to be slated for not developing a specific skill enough. Sweden, Denmark and Holland have the idea, why not admit failure and get advice off them. Then atleast we won't be continuing to extinguish the hopes of our younger generations.",
