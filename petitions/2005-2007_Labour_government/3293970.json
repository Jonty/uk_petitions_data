            "background": "Tony wants us to give him alternatives to charging, well here is one. If we limit the number of vehicles on the road at rush hour we increase the overall speed of the journey which in turn reduces congestion. By preventing commercial vehicles (Lorries, vans etc) from using the roads between 7-9am and 5-7pm we should drastically reduce congestion.\nThe exception to this rule must be road recovery services, buses and other essential vehicles.\nBusinesses should be able to work around this restriction with minimal cost overheads.",
