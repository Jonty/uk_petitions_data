            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "If diesel fuel for road vehicles has a suitable vegetable oil (e.g. rapeseed, since we grow so much of it in the UK) added to it so the mixture contains 10% vegetable oil, the carbon dioxide emissions of the UK would be reduced below those required by the Kyoto agreements.\n\nNot only is the vegetable oil part of the mixture carbon neutral but it also aids the running of the engine because of its increased lubricity.\n\nThe addition of rapeseed oil to diesel can:\n\n1- Help reduce the UK\u2019s dependence on imports and the oil producing nations and improve its balance of payments.\n\n2 - Provide more employment in the UK, through increased use of set aside land and local oil production facilities.\n\n3 - Have a neutral impact on CO2 emissions as the quantity of CO2 emitted when burned is consumed by the replacement plant during its growth cycle.\n\n4 - Substantially reduce the emission of carcinogenic and other noxious particles.",
