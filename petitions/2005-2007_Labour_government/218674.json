We the undersigned call on the Government to do more to make the network of post office branches viable, by allowing them to further diversify in the field of financial services, and furthermore call on the Prime Minister to recognise the essential role they play in combating both financial and social exclusion, and therefore ask the Prime Minister to commit to offering support to the Post Office in the form of allowing it the commercial freedom to compete in the marketplace.",
