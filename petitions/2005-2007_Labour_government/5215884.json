        "background": "Prime Minister this Nation is ignoring a very good oppurtunity for the Nations health & well being.\nBuild a properly constructed Safe , National Road Infrastructure for Cyclists.\nCitizens of this Country will not cycle on the present roads , they are geared up for Vehicles. These roads are too dangerous for the ordinary person.\nGood , safe roads would encourage people to cycle to work , use leisure facilities , social events & visit others but only if safe.An added bonus would be an improvement in peoples health , fitness & self confidence.\nThe environment would improve drastically but the Down Side: Revenue Loss for local councils, less car parking fees & fines plus car tax, insurance profit for companies , less car firm profits & so on.\nThis is why the Nation shuts its eyes & closes its ears to the idea of safe national cycle roads, no profits to be made it will not improve at present, no one in authority is serious enough to improve the situation.\nAct now , take this idea Forward for Our Children & Citizens.",
