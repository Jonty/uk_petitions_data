This, however, leads to the inhibition of freedom of speech.\n\nIn their efforts to prevent drug-addicts resorting to crime, the Government criminalises drug-taking, though this is, in itself, a victimless activity. The Government's \"source targeting\" policy has taken away the freedom of the individual, in respect of their views and activities. This develops into a fascist determinism on the Government's part.",
