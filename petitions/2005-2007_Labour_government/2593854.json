        "background": "In their efforts to prevent inter-racial violence, the Government seeks to go to the root of the problem by legislating against the racist attitudes of organisations such as the B.N.P. This, however, leads to the inhibition of freedom of speech.\n\nIn their efforts to prevent drug-addicts resorting to crime, the Government criminalises drug-taking, though this is, in itself, a victimless activity. The Government's \"source targeting\" policy has taken away the freedom of the individual, in respect of their views and activities. This develops into a fascist determinism on the Government's part.",
