            "background": "I believe that Marvin should have this day as his own for all he represented and all he gave.\nFor the passion, love, sex, inhumanity, injustice, madness, sadness, ego, humility and funkiness he not only sang about but lived.\nHe's the perfect example of a flawed, beautiful, eloquently elegant human there is.\nIt was the day he died and the day before his birthday please make it Marvin Gaye day.\nI'm not even asking it be made a holiday, just recognise it!\n\nThis is not intended to be humorous and what it has to do with government policy is that the government has the ability and the power to create a national holiday.\n\nIf you reject again on the grounds you just gave I shall consider it discriminatory, thankyou",
