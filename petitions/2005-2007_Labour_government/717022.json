            "background": "It is time that this issue was really thought about. how many poeple can remember when they were 16, just left school, can't drink, can't vote, and soon you won't be able to smoke either, but can make one of the biggest decisions they will make in there lives.\nIf the legal age was raised, it may also help tackle the problems of identifying whether for a sexual offence, it should be treated as an offence on a child or adult. At the moment this is an issue, at 16 you could be classed as either depending on which sex the person is and their mental maturity, at 18 you are clearly an adult.\nIf you believe that morals and the law need a helping hand, this issue is one of those that is essential to tackle and not brush under the carpet.",
