            "background": "The government deals with a large amount of electronic data. Much of this data needs to be stored for a long period of time, or be accessible to the population.\nAll this data should be stored in openly documented formats such as OpenDocument (ISO 26300), so the data is not tied to a particular company's programs and remains accessible in the future, when the companies and programs around today may no longer exist. \nThere is a very real danger that proprietary software required to read current proprietary files (eg microsoft word) will not be available in the future (a few years ago, people used wordperfect or wordstar, in a few years time there's a good chance something other than word will be used), or that future versions will be unable to open files created today (current versions of word have trouble reading files created with old versions). \nSimilar legislation is already being proposed or implemented in at least the US (texas, minnesota, massachussets) and in parts of europe.",
