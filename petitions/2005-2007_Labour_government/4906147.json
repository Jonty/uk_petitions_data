            "action": "Reform the sex education given to children in schools to a system similar to that in Holland",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Sex education in Britain's schools is extremely poor and it is, in my opinion, the reason why we have the highest rate of teenage pregnancies in Europe. I believe that it requires radical reform so that a far more comprehensive range of areas are covered in far more detail than at present, and from a much younger age.\nAlso, I believe that more education about relationships, both Heterosexual and Homosexual, should be taught, also from a very young age, and by properly qualified experts on the subject, not just relatively unqualified PSHE teachers or school nurses who just the day before had given the children they teach their innoculations against TB (as was my experience). For example, the Dutch model, which educates children about sex from the age of five and covers a comprehensive syllabus, resulting in an almost negligible rate of teenage or unwanted pregnancies in their country.",
