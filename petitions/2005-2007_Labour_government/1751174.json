        "background": "The current arrangements for running the UK's railways are clearly innefficient and result in very high prices for travellers compared to our near neighbours.\nRenationalisation will allow for more efficient management of the railways through the removal of multiple layers of management and a wasteful so called \"market\", freeing funds for greater investment in track, rolling stock, new high speed services and reducing fares to customers.\nIncreased capacity can then be used to reduce car journeys, avoiding the need for proposed new \"pay as you\" road charging which is clearly as un-popular a tax as you can imagine, and which no-one can guarantee will be re-invested in transport.",
