            "background": "The BBC has recently aired one of the most entertaining drama series in years, namely the Liverpool-based drama 'Lilies'. \n\nThe drama made a delightful and refreshing change from the apparent all-channel obsession with 'reality' or 'celebrity' based television shows which have been aired recently under the banner of 'entertainment'\n\nThe comments left on the official 'Lilies' BBC webpage by viewers such as myself have been overwhelmingly in favour of the programme being brought back for a second series. \n\nThey have shown the delight and pleasure that this simple yet popular drama has brought to people right across the country... not only those from the Liverpool area. \n\nThe senior BBC staff involved have not provided sufficient justification why the series has been axed by the BBC.\n\nI move to request that the BBC commission at least another series of 'Lilies'.  \n\nWhat do you all think???",
