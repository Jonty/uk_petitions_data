        "background": "Recently APIG has performed a public inquiry into the use of DRM which has recommended clearly labelling DRM infected products (among other recommendations). We want the government to go one step further and ban the use of DRM in digital content. We believe DRM removes the freedom of choice between competing products and locks users into using a particular service.\nWe do not believe that digital content should be cost free, but it should be provided in such a way that a person who has purchased a copy of it has control over that copy.",
