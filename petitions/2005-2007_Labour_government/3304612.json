            "background": "Recent petitions wish to ban the NHS bailing out Private hospitals that encounter problems and private presciptions being supplied by the NHS.\nI have no problems with these practices - the NHS is, after all, supposed to cover us all.\nWhat I do have a problem with is NHS consultants \"moonlighting\" in Private hospitals and even using NHS facilities for Private work. \nWhile this unsatisfactory situtation exists patients will remain suspicious that consultants working in both sectors will \"encourage\" the Private option for their own financial gain.\nThe facilities and staff should be completely separate as they are (almost) in Private schools. (The odd peripatetic specialist musical instrument teacher working in both state and private sectors creates no conflict of interest)",
