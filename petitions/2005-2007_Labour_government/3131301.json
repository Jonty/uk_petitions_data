            "background": "Low rate APR's, no annual fees, no monthly charges....we have heard it all before. I know we are responsible for our own finances but when a credit card is offered at a cirtain APR it should be fixed. We can often spend hundreds of pounds on credit cards that when issued was one rate, only for credit companys to introduce higher interest rates, charges and fees - at will, in new terms and conditions. The industry instructs us to be responsible with our spending. All we ask for is a bit of mutual respect. Credit companys should be better regulated and not able to move the goal posts for existing customers. If they want to up the rates or introduce fees and other charges these should be offered to new customers wanting to use their products not enforced upon their existing client base.\nIt seems they win if interest rates are low or high.",
