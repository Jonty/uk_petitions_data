This would render vehicles unusable or stop vehicles in chases, drunk drivers, and non taxed vehicles but quicker than spike sticks which allow vehicles to carry on sometimes for miles. With Over 1m vehicle on the road which should not be there, this would save lives and Millions in costs to motorists. \n\nThe boxes would stop the engine working, so that we rid the roads of uninsured, drunk, speeding, banned and others who cost the motorist, hospitals and emergency services millions each year.  This would make the roads a safer place and is well overdue, as the penalty for most offences do not deter, and ends up costing peoples lives.  The boxes to be funded by the road fund tax that is taken by the government not the motorist, as it\u2019s the government that is going to make the biggest monetary savings.",
