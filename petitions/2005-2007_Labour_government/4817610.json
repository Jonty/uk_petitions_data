            "background": "Community first responders have a diffacult job responding to category A ambulance emergency calls within eight minutes. First responders who have completed advanced driver training, and are adaquetely insured should be allowed to use blue lights and sirens on their vehicles. Many first responders are ambulance personnel who are off duty, or work in the private ambulance sector, thus already have advanced driving qualifications. The law allows Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs officers to use blue lights, and theyhave not had advanved driver training. I am not suggesting that untrained first aiders be permitted to use blue lights, such as those with St John or Red Cross, but those who have completed the advanced driving course should be permitted.",
