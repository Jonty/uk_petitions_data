        "background": "Mr Blair seems to feel very strongly about green issues, in particular co2 emissions from cars.  I feel this is all a ruse to create more new and ever creative ways to steal money from cars owners.  If he truely believed in the enviromental impact of these emissions he would see it in the public interest to use revenue to create water engines.  In a suburb of Toronto, Canada has in fact discovered not one but two viable methods for breaking down ordinary water into hydrogen and oxygen. Neither method involves the need to spend a billion dollars. They are simple answers. The existing engines in our automobiles could work with these systems with very little alteration and no need for an external support.  I feel that it is about time that the Prime Minister of Great Britain behaved in a manner that is consistant with being a public SERVANT and not a puppet for big business, USA or any other fuel producing country.",
