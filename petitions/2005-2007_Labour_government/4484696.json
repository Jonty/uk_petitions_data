            "background": "GOD SAVE THE QUEEN is not a National Anthem - even if it has been used for that purpose.\n\nIt divides the nation due to its references to \"God\" and alienates and excludes those of other religions, or of no religion, who do not follow the Christian faith, from genuinely singing it.\n\nIt is not about a nation, nor supporting a nation, it is about a monarch.\n\nWe need a genuinely National Anthem that unites us rather than a song which, by its very nature, divides. \n\nI suggest a feasibility study is put into place to explore the possibilities of a nationwide competition to write an appropriate new National Anthem which could include suggestions of existing songs as well as newly composed ones.",
