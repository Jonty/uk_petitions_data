            "background": "BBCWorld is the only TV channel we know of which relates to life in the UK and the world generally. But is has deteriorated abysmally in the past few months; advertisements for past  programmes are often shown, and technical hitches, both visual and aural, are far too common. There are some excellent programmes which appear only once (e.g. Art in the Arctic)  and sink without trace while some poor ones appear week after week.\nPlease ensure that it is better funded and better managed. Alan Yentob was a wonderful producer but rarely appears on BBC any more.",
