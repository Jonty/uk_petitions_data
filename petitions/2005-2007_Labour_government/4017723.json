        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There is strong feeling amongst junior doctors against MTAS the new recruitment system. MTAS has not been tested, is seriously flawed, it will affect medical training detrimentally and is extremely unpopular amongst medical staff of all grades. MTAS will not stand up to public or legal scrutiny because of all the problems it has faced from its inception until now. Our junior doctors will loose faith and not trust the recruitment process and this will destabilise medical workforce in the NHS. It took 4-5 years for GPs to develop a similar but much simpler recruitment system. Hospital specialist training is a lot more complex and one-size fits all will not work.  \nThe aim of the petition is to suspend MTAS in its current form and return to the old system of recruiting training doctors for another year. This will give us more time to work out how to implement the MMC-modernising medical careers and we would learn from the mistakes made so far. We will regain the confidence and trust of our junior doctors.",
