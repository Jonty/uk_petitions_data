            "background": "It is wrong that pensions contributions tax-refunds are not capped according to median incomes. In effect the poor worker subsidises the rich workers pension, and the richer ones the most.\n\nAs it stands pension schemes do not benefit all members equally, if the funds are low, the retired get full pension, those coming to retirement often get little or nothing nothing of their many years of contributions. This clearly disadvantages the younger members of all schemes and as pensioners live longer than ever, this burden is already disproportionate.\n\nSo come on Mr Blair be fair!\n\nLet All members of pensions schemes be treated equally, and let the tax refunds be capped to median wages.",
