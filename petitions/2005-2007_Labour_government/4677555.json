        "action": "Require all cigarettes and tobacco related products sold or consumed in the UK to be of the Reduced Ignition Preponsity (Fire Safe) type to reduce the number of fire deaths attributable to cigarettes",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Government have set very challenging targets to reduce the number of fire deaths.  Analysis shows that a majority of these 500 deaths per year are attributable to cigarettes, often dropped when the smoker is incapacitated due to drink, drugs or other reasons\n\nCigarettes of a safer type are mandatory in New York by law. These cigarettes are made from a slightly different paper massively reducing the likelihood of starting a fire if they are dropped.  The cost of producing these Reduced Ignition Propensity (RIP) cigarettes is no different, but they have a chance of starting a life threatening fire of between 10 and 30% of those currently sold in the UK\n\nThe effect in New York has been a significant reduction in the number of fire deaths and injuries.  So successful has this been that many other states within the USA are at various stages of introducing similar legislation\n\nFor the UK to reduce Fire deaths legislation to require all cigarettes to meet an RIP standard is the only solution",
