        "background": "The church of scientology is an organisation that routinely harrasses detractors, divides communities, splits up families, and has several well known links to unpleasant deaths, bankruptcies and attempts to infiltrate government. \n\nThe church of scientology is a genuine security threat for the nation as well as private individuals and their families. It is therefore prudent to ban the church of scientology from the UK as well as banning or at least closely monitoring any affiliate or \"front\" companies of the church.",
