            "background": "Attaching an automated interest penalty to child support payments that fall into arrears provides some compensation for the claimant experiencing late or non payment from the absent parent.  \nIt will encourage many absent parents to make the correct payment amounts and on a regular basis.  \n\nIt is a fair system to the absent parent even where arears build up as a result of administrative delays as they will continue to benefit from bank interest on the money up until the time it leaves their account.\n\nIt is simple to apply to the current CSA collection procedure and offers an effective deterent for serial offenders.\n\nMany families endure real day to day financial hardship due to inconsistency in CSA payments.\n\nIntroducing Arrears Interest would have a positive impact on one of the greatest failings of the current CSA process, without any additional work burden for the CSA staff.",
