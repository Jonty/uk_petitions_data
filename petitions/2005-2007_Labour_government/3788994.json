            "background": "There are hundreds of tasks within the community which don't get done due to budget restrictions, like litter collection, graffiti cleaning, footpath gritting etc.  And there are a lot of people on unemployment benefit who are too lazy to work, or have got out of the work ethic, or even just want something to occupy themselves while out of work.  Replacing unemployment benefit with a payment for fulfilling these tasks would increase the work ethic, and also make the country a nicer place to be in, and instil more civic pride in everyone.",
