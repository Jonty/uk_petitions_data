        "background": "The UK housing market is driven upwards by a combination of shortage of supply and buy-to-let investors. As there is no foreseeable end to the housing shortage the primary purpose of houses must be to enable people to live in their chosen community rather than as an extra income/investment for the already well off. Taxation should be used to reflect this including a much higher stamp duty for second homes and a higher rate of tax on income from second homes.",
