        "background": "Given the coverage school uniforms have received to date, and the governments desire to keep school uniform at an affordable price point - why don't they take a more pro-active stance and abolish VAT on items of uniform that carry a school badge? This would help schools to keep their identity, keep the benefits of school specific uniform in place, and drive down the cost of uniform for the people they claim to want to help most.",
