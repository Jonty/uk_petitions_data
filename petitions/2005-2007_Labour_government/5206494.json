            "background": "More upper-middle class people than ever line their pockets through buy-to-let housing and in doing so price more and more hard working lower income people out of the opportunity to own their own home.\n\nA tax of even several thousand pounds for a second house is pointless due to the housing shortage and the enormouse profits in property.\n\nCapping the number of buy-to-let properties for an individual or couple is the ONLY realistic way to make mortgages possible and affordable for first time buyers. More homeowners means more people better off than they currently are, and more council housing stock givng more people the opportunity to live independent lives, and as such a healthier economy for us all.",
