This site promises that petitioner will be individually contacted by No. 10 after the petitions deadline, and that they will get a response to their petition's plight. Attempting to avoid  divide and rule policy, this petition asks the PM to be open about which petitions are being considered - and provide details about that. This, I hope, will open up the process on this site for full debates and public scrutiny. \nAlso, check petitions.pm.gov.uk/search?q=faith+schools for similarities allowed..",
