            "background": "Renationalisation of the railways would allow the money currently given as subsidy to spent on maintaining and improving the British rail network, instead of giving this money to rail company shareholders.  If people are to stop using their own personal transport, then a viable and reasonably priced public transport network is needed for this to happen.  This would reduce congestion, wear and tear on roads and carbon emissions, helping almost everyone.",
