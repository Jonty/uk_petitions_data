            "background": "As a student who does not recieve EMA, i find i do not have the motivation to go to lessons as i would if i did recieve even just \u00a310 a week. My peers recieve bonuses for doing homework on time etc, why can't that apply to everyone?\nMany are dropping out after GCSE's, and we need to increase furthur education. By doing this, i wish the government to take ALL factors of a families income into account, including the amount of children they have, the benefits they recieve already, and the sort of post 16 education they are recieving. The government should set up a system so that all students, regardless of their background can recieve benefits for staying on in education. This is benefical, as the money could go towards Travel, school trips, books etc.",
