            "background": "We campaign to have a new stop inserted and a new walkway built on the (West London side of the) North London Line which as a result will make an interchange between the Central line and the North London line. This will open up the restricted integrated transport opportunites on the North London Line and encourage more people to use the service which is\nsoon to be operated by TfL's new 'London Overground'operation. This low cost initiative will have a significant benefit to a catchment area of 500,000 people from Kew, Chiswick, Acton, Ealing, Shepards Bush and Kilburn. It will prove to a central access point for West Londoners to attend the London 2012 Olympics.",
