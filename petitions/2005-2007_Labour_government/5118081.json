Type I (previously known as Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy - R.S.D.)\nC.R.P.S. Type II (previously known as Causalgia) \n\nA diagnosis of C.R.P.S. Type II is given when nerve injury is identifiable. In cases where no nerve damage can be found, but the symptoms are those of C.R.P.S., a diagnosis of Type I is given. Often nerve damage is assumed, even when it cannot be identified.\n\n\nAs of yet there is no cure for C.R.P.S. and the treatments available to C.R.P.S. patients are usually ineffective.",
