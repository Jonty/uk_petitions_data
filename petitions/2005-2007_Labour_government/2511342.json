            "background": "Following the heartbreaking story of 2 year old Casey Mullen, I would like to propose that rapists who commit crimes on children under the age of 16 should be chemically castrated. this will not only prevent them from ever commiting such a crime again, it will also prevent them from being such a drain on our society by keeping them in a high security prison. If somone is able to carry out such a sick and violent crime on a innocent and defenceless human being, then no amount of counselling is going to help or guarantee they will not reoffend. We must do something about this. This story has left me terrified for myself and two young children in my own home. Why should we be frightened in our homes and communities.I think that if this was introduced, rapists would soon start to think twice.",
