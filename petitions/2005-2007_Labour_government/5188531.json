Although some greyhounds are rehomed, many are not and will never experience the love or security of a home environment. The only way to stop this mistreatment is to ban greyhound racing all together, while people are betting on the dogs they are indirectly encouraging them.many owners go to desperate lengths to kill them, as well as cutting off there ears so the dogs are unrecognisable by there ear tatoos. These poor creatures deserve more than to just beuse dfor financial gain. Rather tahn being abandoned whent he becoma a financial liability.",
