            "background": "The guided busway is an innovative and appropriate response to Cambridge's transport problem.  Unlike rail it will serve local commuters who need to travel into the heart of Cambridge and many other destinations in and around the city.  Unlike rail it will not bring yet more scarce local housing (including new developments) into easy reach of London commuters.  Unlike the former or proposed rail lines it will also provide a parallel cycleway, providing an alternative to dangerous local roads.  We urge the government to provide whatever support is needed to make the guided busway a success.",
