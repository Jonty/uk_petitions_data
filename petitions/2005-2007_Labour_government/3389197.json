            "background": "There is a great myth going round England currently, thanks to the government.  This is the unfounded idea that A Level exams are getting easier.  As a student who completed A Levels last year, I can assure you they are NOT!  I was successful in gaining ABB, but I really worked for it.  The reason they think its getting easier, is because teachers are becoming more familiar with the material.  The students still have to work extremely hard to get to grips with it, though when they are successful in doing so the government immediately think the system is too easy.  IS THERE A PROBLEM WITH STUDENTS UNDERSTANDING SOMETHING!!!??!!   I urge you to help me persuade the government to keep A Levels the way they are.",
