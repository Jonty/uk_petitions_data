Walls of 5-layer floor-to-ceiling glass combined with heat-exchange & air-conditioning will greatly enhance the experience of working & education at home [i.e., teleworking].\n\nTied to global-warming, commuting is prohibitively expensive & overcrowded on a hopeless transport-infrastructure. Mandating desk-jockeys telework 4 or more days per-week will address the need for congestion-charging & reduce pollution.",
