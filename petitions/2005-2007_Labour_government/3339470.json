            "background": "Because Britain was the cradle of most international sports an anomaly has arisen whereby Britain - unlike any other nation - often competes on international level in its component parts rather than with a united national team. During recent years this unfortunate state of affairs has fostered regional separatism so that the unity of our beloved United Kingdom is now under threat. One sport has come up with an ideal solution however, namely Rugby Union, which stages regular international tours by \"British Lions\" sides consisting of players from throughout the British Isles. If other sports were to follow this superb example then not only would British national pride be enhanced and regionalism rendered obsolete - but Britain would probably start to win far more international competitions!",
