            "background": "The visa fee to United Kingdom dramatically increase in April 1st (more than double than the previous price). Before it is already expensive, but now it is crazy. The problem is also the duration on the increase, note that in order to have an interview schedule, we have to wait around 3-4 weeks. When I sign the form, the visa cost is only 132 Euros, but I receive the interview in April, few days before interview I check the fee and its becoming 300 Euro. It is unfair since we already apply before the price is set, and it is not our fault if we can not have an interview directly after we applied.\nThe increment of visa fee have to be reconsider or delayed sufficiently in order to accomodate those who already register before 1st of April.",
