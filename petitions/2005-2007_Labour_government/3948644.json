            "background": "Calling for the abolition of the unreasonable and unjustified increase of immigration application fees, which would be effective on and after 1st April 2007. The most noticeable increase are the application for Indefinite Leave to Remain, increased from \u00a3335 to \u00a3750 (premium rate increased from \u00a3500 to \u00a3950); and the application for Naturalisation, increased from \u00a3200 to \u00a3575. Furthermore, if an application was refused, no application fees will be refunded. This is utterly unfair and discriminatory towards many legitimate immigrants who live by the rules. This will, however, hardly affect those who are in the UK illegally, since they are highly unlikely to make any applications per sae. This has once again demonstrated the incompetence of the Home Office and the vulnerability of the legitimate immigrants who are lack of any representation in the democratic society.",
