            "background": "My petition's aim is to increase the annual duty on 4x4 vehicles with engine capacities larger than 2500cc's. Agricultural vehicles of a 4x4 nature are usually less that 2500cc and farmers have a legitimate need, many other 4x4's that are used on road and in town exceed 2500cc's. The average cupic capacity of these vehicles is around 3750cc's. Our aim is ensure smaller engined vehicles are used to reduce Co2 output.",
