            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "No mention has been made of how the road pricing will effect small businesses. As a small electrical business, we are unable to use public transport, because of the amount of materials, and tools we need to take to each job and the job could entail travelling large distances. This road pricing scheme would penalise us unfairly making it costly to travel to clients to give free estimates etc and would also affect the general public because these costs would be passed on to them. Please could the PM state how he intends to support businesses under the proposed road pricing scheme?",
