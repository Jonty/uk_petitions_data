Your Government have continually denied responsibilty for these losses even though the Parliamentary Ombudsman and your own internal Select Committee, headed by Tony Wright have proven maladministration. This gross injustice and the recommendations made urgently needs your intervention and for you to recognise that such action is essential if the future of pensions in this country is to be established.",
