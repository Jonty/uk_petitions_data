            "background": "We ask Mr Blair to stop all immigration until our borders are restored.  There should be a blanket ban.  This would enable our country to sort out the mess that has been made by the government i.e. detention centres and deportation.  This would also help the anti-terror campaign because open borders are a perfect breeding ground for terror acts against our country.  We are over-run by these people, they are taking our jobs, and our welfare services are going under because of it.  The NHS is in crisis because of it.  Too many people and not enough staff to cope with them.  You have given away our heritage, Mr Blair, and we do not like it.  Multiculturalism does not work. People do not like being over-run by other people.  It is a fact of life.  It is simple to understand.  British people are fed up with this Britain that you have created since you have been in power.  Now please do something about changing it and giving us back our heritage!",
