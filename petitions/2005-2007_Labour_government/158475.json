            "background": "Road \"congestion\" charging proposals have been built into a ridiculously complex and invasive system of tracking devices, number plate recognition systems etc. Vehicle types will be taxed under other proposals regardless of how much they actually pollute or congest!\nMany drivers on the road today have no insurance, meaning many accident victimes are inadequately compensated, if at all.\n\nSwitching Vehicle Excise Duty and mandatory 3rd party insurance for a larger tax on fuel is the fairest way to reduce pollution and congestion, as the consumer pays proportionaly to their consumption. The insurance companies (who do not deserve the free lunch!) can simply provide better fire/theft/comprehensive cover, or fall by the wayside.",
