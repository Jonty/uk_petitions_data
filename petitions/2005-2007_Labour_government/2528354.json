        "background": "to improve the flow of traffic during \"quite times\" and to lessen co2 emmissions let all traffic lights (where possible & in safety) show amber (or flash amber). they should be approached with caution but if road clear a vehicle can cross (obviously give way as normal). this works in germany and there are no vehicles sat waiting for lights to change during the night. it is also possible to deaden some traffic lights in villages/small towns/little used area's altogether over this period, lessening co2 and saving fuel & electricity.",
