            "background": "Today is the anniversary of the death of the actress Charlotte Coleman. As a fitting tribute to her talent asthma sufferers should be exempt from prescription charges. Asthma suffers have to have at least two types of inhalers which are charged at the current rate, which means for every prescription we are being charged \u00a312 plus for the right to live. The morality of whether it is right to charge people for the right to breath is the question.",
