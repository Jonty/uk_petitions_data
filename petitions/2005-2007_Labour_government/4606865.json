            "background": "Steve Harris founded Iron Maiden arguably, Britain's most successful ever rock band.\n\nMost succesful British rock bands have a lifespan of 10 or so years, Iron Maiden are one of a limited number that have bucked that trend and have entertained millions and millions over an unbroken period of 30 years.  Steve Harris has been the driving force behind Iron Maiden throughout that time.\n\nIron Maiden are often the band that encourage youngsters into Rock music; one of the pleasures of a Maiden gig is the healthy mix of young and old.  Steve Harris, as a very fit, relatively moderate drinker, is a great role model for the younger fans that his band continuously attracts.\n\nRock music is a huge part of the lives of many people in Britain.  It is right that the contributions of the most senior figures in British rock music are recognised by the establishment. Steve Harris is, arguably, the most deserving of that recognition.",
