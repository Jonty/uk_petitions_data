        "background": "The Chinese government is seeking to lift the international ban. Under fierce pressure from tiger farms the Chinese government claims the current ban has cost their economy \u00a32 billion and done little to stem the fall in tiger numbers across Asia.\n\nTiger products like bone have medicinal and aphrodisiac properties, but there are a significant number of Chinese medical practitioners who say tiger bone can be substituted by other animals.\n\nChina should begin enforcing the ban rather than have it lifted",
