            "background": "We call on the PM to recognize that current EU and UK policy on bio-fuels: \n\n1) Is largely encouraging bio-fuels that cause more emissions than they save; \n\n2) Is leading to accelerated destruction of valuable habitat, such as tropical forest, with consequent loss of biodiversity and displacement of people; \n\n3) Is already driving up food prices and will ultimately threaten many with starvation.  \n\nIn the light of this, we call on the PM:\n\n1) To scrap UK targets for bio-fuel substitution and to seek withdrawal of EU targets; \n\n2) To suspend all incentives for bio-fuels, where they are not produced from waste, or from non-agricultural/forestry sources; \n\n3) To link levels of support to levels of CO2 emission savings; \n\n4) To ban the production/import of bio-fuels and bio-fuel feedstock, where their production is associated, directly, or indirectly, with habitat destruction, or with greater CO2 emissions than from fossil fuels.",
