        "background": "Vicarage road , st James Northampton is a terrible road for school children to cross , There have been quite a few car crashes there as the cars come up the road very fast, cars also park along the road so you cant see what is approaching and with it being a primary school there are young children that have to cross it everyday. How long will it be before there is a child hit or killed ? please either put in a crossing or get a lollypop person to aid them across the road",
