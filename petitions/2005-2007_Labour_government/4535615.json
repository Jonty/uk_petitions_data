            "background": "Ismet Hyseni came to UK in May 1999 - under Humanitarian Evacuation Programme. Ismet settled in Glasgow.He kept busy the past 8 years by doing volunteer work (with British Red Cross, Refugee Teaching in Scotland Project, Bridges Project). Ismet is 40 years old, unmarried and without children. The stress of his immigration problems as well as his traumatic past in Kosovo have impacted on his mental health.His 3 brothers, 2 sisters, elderly father and their families ho came here at same time as Ismet have all been given settlement in UK. Many of the 23 immediate family have UK nationality today. Why is Ismet being denied settlement when he has never committed any crime in UK or Kosovo? After 8 years here, it is inhumane and unfair to forcibly remove him to Kosovo where he has no home, no family or job waiting there for him. Kosovo has poor medical provision for persons with mental ill-health. Ismet was arrested on 4th April 2007 at Glasgow Immigration Offices and is facing deportation on Thursday 12 April'07.Please urge this government to look at Ismet's situation again and grant him settlement on human rights / compassionate. Home office reference: H1020175 - Ismet Hyseni (Kosovo).",
