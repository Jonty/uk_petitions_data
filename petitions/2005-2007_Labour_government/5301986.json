        "background": "Get tough!! What is typical of any other government that has taken the reins for the last 20 yrs - THEY DO NOT LISTEN TO THE PEOPLE THAT PUT THEM THERE IN THE FIRST INSTANCE. If you see the report on immigration posted on the Telegraph website then it is clear that immigration needs urgent action NOW, the human rights acts needs to be abolished so that criminals & ethnic minorities cannot use this awful act to escape rightful punishment &/or deportation.Like Australia we should state it is their responsibility to integrate in Britain not the other way round & that OUR values and culture are what made us great in the first place. We don't want Sharia Law or extremists, fanaticals, we need decent law abiding people who can enrich our once envied country not pillage all its assets and resources. \nAny country that spends more resoures & commitment to capturing speeding motorists that it does to say helping the very vunerable - the old,the disabled & the very young from being victims of rape,torture or abuse is just moving completely in the wrong direction.",
