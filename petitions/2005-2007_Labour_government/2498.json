            "background": "The A9 road which lays across Columbo to Jaffna has been closed therefore the daily needs for people to survive have been restricted. Many innocent civilians are suffering without food, water and medicine if the Sri Lankan government is persuaded to open the pathway this will spare many lives. Also another matter to be concerned about is the level of understanding by the British public of the happenings to the blameless Tamils in Sri Lanka. Alerting Britain of the discrimination against the minority Tamils is highly significant.",
