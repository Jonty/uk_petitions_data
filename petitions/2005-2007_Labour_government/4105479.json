            "background": "I would like to bring to the governments attention, that the hard working people of this country have had enough of the unemployed taking advantage of the benefit system and becoming financialy better off, we should be making it harder for them to survive without working, so they need to get a job, there is a job for everyone what ever thier circumstances. With this concept maybe there would be more money in the treasury to help the NHS etc, instead of taxing hardworking citizens to compensate for the people who won't work. You should be helping the workers who pay for the country not the ones that take and don't contribute",
