            "background": "I am well aware that in this country there is a blackhole with regards to the number of local authority and housing association properties availible to rent compared to the number of people in search of decent affordable housing. However there is an increasing trend whereby people are letting private accomodation which is being funded by housing benefit.There is now a thriving bussinnes wherby individuals are becomming very wealthy at the taxpayers expense. The main problem is that a number of theses tenants have been excluded from housing associations because of their previous poor conduct and they are now living next to people like myself who have worked hard to buy their own property and are now watching the value of their property go into freefall. This situation may provide a short term solution, however the taxpayers money would be better spent on the building for the future, and not destroying established communities and linning the pockets of often unscrupulous landlords.",
