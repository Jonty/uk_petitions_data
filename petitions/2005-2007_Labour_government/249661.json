            "background": "By limiting humans to a maximum of 2 children per female (allowances can be made for twins etc when conceived naturally from a second pregnancy)eventually the population would stabilise. There should be no financial incentives for 1st or 3rd and subsequent children. Fertility programmes should be limited to 1 child per woman and should be self-funded. Sterilisation dates should be offered after each birth and actively encouraged after 2nd births. Limiting the human population in this way will help to ease poverty, global terrorisation of our planet's natural resources. The Earth cannot sustain the human population at the current growth rate.",
