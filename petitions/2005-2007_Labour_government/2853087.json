We are missing out on super deals offerd by companies such as Orange and Sky who both offer free internet access to their subscibers.It is ironic that William Wilberforce was from Hull but Hull residents are still held as slaves by Karoo Internet (kingston Comms) The level of service offered by Kingston Comms is well below par and well documented. Surely competition is a good thing.",
