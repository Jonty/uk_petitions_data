            "background": "I feel that awarding these valliant soldiers honours for their heroic act is befitting of the circumstances.  There are few who deserve such honours, but even fewer who would fly back into the jaws of hell for a fallen comrade and under such heavy fire that the whole of 45 Commando had to previously retreat from battle.  I feel it would be a great dis-service for this act of pure valour to go unrecognised.  It requires more than a mere mention in the House of Commons, more than a few newspaper reports that will be forgotten tomorrow.  It is the true spirit of the British; real love towards friends; pure courage in adversity.  This act should not be allowed to fade like a sandcastle on the shore as high tide comes rolling in.  Rather, it should stand as a testament to what this country stands for, namely honour, integrity, trust, friendship, valour and determination.",
