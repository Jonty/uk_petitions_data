            "background": "I petition the Government to advocate its own transport policies and ensure that all MP and also the PM use public transport to attend work as they seem so determined to make the general public do.   This would save money on maintenance on these vehicles, fuel wasted whilst moving one passenger at a time in most cases and also choufeurs salaries spent waiting for meetings that are constantly running over.   If this is impracticable they should use taxi's like the remainder of the country\n\nAdditionally force the government to take legal action regarding all the illegal cars on the road, as doing so would remove hundreds of thousands of cars with high outputs thereby reducing emissions and enabling the tax on 4 x 4's to remain equal to any other road user.\n\n4 x 4's are safer for the occupant plus pass the same stringent MOT set by the Government and until the Police and Government take action to reduce these illegal vehicles we have the right to protect ourselves and families in any way we can, the Government of the People should listen to the people to see what they want and stop telling the people of this country what they should do.",
