        "background": "Steve Wright has many faults in his presentation style on BBC Radio 2. He frequently talks over songs, plays music he personally prefers, rudely dismisses people's requests for songs and frequently cuts interviews short. He also repeats the news five minutes after it has just been read. When Mark Radcliffe stood in for Steve on 12-16 March 2007, it was a breath of fresh air, with good music and lengthy interviews as well as much better banter and jokes. Let's boot Steve out and get Mark in permanently!",
