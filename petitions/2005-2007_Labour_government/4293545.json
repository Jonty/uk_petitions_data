        "background": "I was at Wembley on Saturday and was appalled by the prices of Food and Drink. For example a Hot Dog was \u00a35.60, Crisps \u00a31.50 and a cup of coffee was \u00a33.00. I am led to believe that the prices at Hampden Park were at least over half price cheaper. So isit only English Fans that have to put up with being taken advantage off. I was in total agreement that Programmes were only 3 pound and ticket prices were ten pound. I heard a gentlemen behind me bought two hot dogs and two coffee's and had little change from a twenty pound note. Why are the charges so high. I explained to my children that I could have a meal at Nando's for the price of a Hot dog. I know the cost of the Hot dog to create was probably no more than one pound when bought on a bulk basis. Why was  we ripped off",
