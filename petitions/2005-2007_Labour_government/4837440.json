            "background": "Crop waste on farms causes disposal problems. There is a desire to generate as much energy as naturally as possible. I would like the goverment to consider the possibility of subsidies or assistance, to farms in general, for the installation, use and maintenance, under agricultural regulations, of crop waste digesters, to reduce the needs for artificial fertiliser products, to generate a source of renewable natural gas, for piping, storage or direct electrical generation, and to give the farms in question a more stable source of income, thereby allowing the possible use of managed land of all forms, to be used as a solar power source.",
