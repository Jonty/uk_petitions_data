            "background": "I have a chronic disease with no cure,Chrohn's disease.My disease would become worse with no meds & lead to a hospital admission or surgery costing the tax payer \u00a3\u00a3's.There are many diseases like this.We've no choice but to take medication & we shouldn't have to pay for the meds to keep well.I work & pay my taxes(I work for the NHS!)but then I have to pay extra again. \nIt's not limited to drugs,when I had surgery I had to pay for the dressings,ointments,antibiotics etc for over a yr.There is a Pre-payment certificate,\u00a395 for a year which does help,but still too much.It NEEDS to be free,people with chronic ilness have enough to worry about without worrying about how to pay for the meds to keep them well!Why do pregnant women get free meds,its not an illness?Heroin addicts get free methadone,why?The disease that I & others have is not through choice and we feel penialised.The disease chose us & we shouldn't have to pay for that.Thanks for listening.",
