(v) Save fuel.\nAll of the above will save a tremendous amount of money and will make driving less stressful!\nI can think of no downside to this proposal other than initial cost of installation. Compensation for this will be the on-going savings on fuel!\nFor those who will say that overtaking might be dangerous, I will refer them to the drivers of Heavy Goods vehicles who drive with limiters fitted.",
