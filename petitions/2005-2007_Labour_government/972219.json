        "background": "Have you ever gone into debt because of bank charges? Hard-Working British citizens are being hit with ridiculous Bank charges, forcing many people into debt. This month alone i was hit with a \u00a339 charge but over the past 2-3 years i have paid almost \u00a3500 in charges. What are the charges for? everytime you ask the bank the only response is 'Administration Charges'. A law should be passed stating a fair maximum amount a bank should be allowed to charge (at the moment most banks issue a maximum penalty of \u00a3150 or more!), a detailed explaination and breakdown of the costs involved in Penalties and the people that are most likely to go overdrawn be allowed to have an agreed overdraft facility applied to their account.",
