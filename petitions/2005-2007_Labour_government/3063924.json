        "background": "We ask the Prime Minister to have a talk to FOM Owner Bernie Ecclestone about saving the British Formula 1 grand prix at Silverstone.\nFor too long, Mr Ecclestone and FOM are squeezing the BRDC into making Silverstone into a world class track which they cannot do as they dont have the money to make the required improvements.\nSo we call on the Prime Minister to talk to Mr Ecclestone and to give money to the BRDC which can allow them to make Silverstone the best motor racing Track in the World.\nIf you can plough 5 billion pounds into a months Olympics in London, then surely the Government can give the BRDC 40 million pounds to make Silverstone a world class track for years to come.",
