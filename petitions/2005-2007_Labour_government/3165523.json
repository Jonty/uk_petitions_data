            "background": "In 1998 the Competitions Act was introduced, this act was to stop larger companies from creating a cartel or consortium with other large companies, therefore creating a fairer competitive market for not only consumers, but small and medium businesses. Many small businesses have reported this breach to the Office of Fair Trading, but nothing has been done to stop it. Please sign my petition as this seems to be the last option left to us small businesses in Great Britain.",
