We are overwhelmed by Immigration beyond infrastructure, resources and land capacity.\nOvercrowding, congestion, and limited resources robs the nation of a quality of life!\nFurthermore catastrophic consequences await by overpopulating our shorelines and esturaries in the face of climate change! Life is endangered and not outgrowing our resources is key to survival and quality of life! Immigration made up more than half of Britain's population growth from 1991 to 2001.\nImmigrants don't come with their own:- House, Water and Energy, School Place, Hospital Bed, Benefits or Pension, Prison Cell, Bus, Train, Plane seat etc, or Essential Land for their Population Growth!",
