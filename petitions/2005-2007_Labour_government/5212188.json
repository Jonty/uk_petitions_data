Also any change in Prime minister should face a general election. If the new Prime minister is any good they should have nothing to fear by having an immediate election. It should not be down to party politics to decide the future of this great nation without putting this to the vote of the general public. If politicans had backbone and meant what they said they would have to deliver with a fair voting system rather than keep moving the goal post.",
