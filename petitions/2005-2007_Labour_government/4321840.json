        "action": "Replace the 22 years old 'Northern Rail' 142 Pacers.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "These 142 Pacer trains have little or no heating because the heaters do not work correctly. The trains do not have double glazed windows and the doors do not stop the the wind coming in due to their flimsy construction, therefore the trains are exremely cold when the weather is inclement. In hot weather the heating must be left on or the engines will overheat, this causes the passengers to bare intollerable hot temperatures. The seats do not have headrests nor armrests. The trains do not have bogies, just a single axle at each end, this causes the trains to bounce up and down excessively and lurch from side to side. These actions cause numerous back problems to Drivers and guards. Guards have been thrown about and injured whilst doing tickets and, because of the gross overcrowding, passengers who are stood up have been injured. These trains are not much better than cattle wagons. Please replace them.",
