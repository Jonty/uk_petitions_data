        "background": "What is Child Abuse?  There is little clear definition.  Succeeding generations provide different insights, confusing many professionals and the general public alike.\n\nWhen the Social Service framework by way of the Family Courts merely has to indicate that abuse is \"probable\" rather than demonstrate that it is actual, to require the forced removal of a child from its home, how can this ever benefit any child?  Any procedure must only commence with parental consent not in spite of it.\n\nThe single most effective means of restoring the fragmented family unit is to respect it and to acknowledge that, as in Criminal Law, parents and carers are innocent until proven otherwise. \n\nWithout this basic fundamental, an ever-deepening breakdown of trust will continue, thereby eroding the foundations of the family unit and family life.",
