            "background": "Many illegal immigrants are making significant contribution to the development of the British economy and society as a whole. To send them back could be a loss to this country. I say either give them permanent residence if they have been law-abiding or grant them legal stay on a 'proabationary' three-year period. Their records could be reviewed each year to be funded at their own cost. This will allow the govt. to assess the value of their contribution and to decide whether they should remain or not. Those with a criminal record should be made to leave. Once the Amnesty is declared - ports of entry should then be managed tightly with a proper monitoring system in place.",
