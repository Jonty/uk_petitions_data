            "background": "It is essential that the UK does not become devolved as it increasingly is, all the home nations would die in poverty except England, little things such as below may help revive the dying british nationality.\n\nMake currency exactly the same - bank of United Kingdom (not England, Scotland or Northern Ireland), this would resolve the different currency issue.\n\nPut the welsh dragon on the union flag, so Wales is included (could make it smaller and put it in the middle of the red cross), this would be popular move in Wales.\n\nHave a British team for major world tournaments like the world cup (like the GB team in the Olympics) but keep as separate in less major tournaments.",
