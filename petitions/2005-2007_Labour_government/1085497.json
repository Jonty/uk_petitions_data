But I also enjoy the odd bit of chocolate, crisps etc and I shouldn't be forced to pay more in tax on those items because of this nanny state. I do indulge in regular exercise to balance things out. But what really annoys me is the way young schoolchildren are banned from eating any junk food, let them enjoy them, the school years are bad enough already for me anyway",
