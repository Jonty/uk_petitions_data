            "background": "The NHS is a disgrace. It costs the tax payer an obscene amount of money. The lack of competiton creates an inefficient, bureaucratic, top-heavy and complacent system that delivers a poor service in comparison to other European countries. Scrap the NHS in favour of a system of individual private medical insurance. This would promote a more streamlined, responsible and accountable environment that would ultimately result in a higher quality service to the public.",
