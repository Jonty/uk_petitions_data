        "background": "With the drive to make Britain Healthier I think it is time that the Government banned tinned fruit that comes with Syrup. People who have little money buy cheap tinned fruit to help get their five a day fruit and veg, but fruit in syrup has no goodness. Only fruit in natural fruit juices should be available on shop shelves.",
