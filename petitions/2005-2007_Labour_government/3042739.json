        "background": "I am not trying to latch on to the notoriety of the exisiting road tax petition on this site.I simply wish to petition to ensure that it receives the acknowlegdement and democratic debate it deserves rather than ill founded and desperate accusations of it being improperly worded and a lame e-mail from the PM. I call for all pilot road tax schemes to be abolished until the existing petition has been publically debated with absolute transparency and clarity in the governments proposals.If this matter is not properly debated and road tax is implemented against the will of the British Public then I will never in my lifetime pay so much as a penny of the proposed or similar road tax schemes.",
