Women must cover their hair and body under threat of incarceration; homosexuality is punishable by death in the gallows; jews can be executed for supporting Israel; freedom of expression is non-existent and all media are under government control.\nThe taking hostage of our soldiers, even in disputed territory, is an act of war that should have been responded to in an appropriate manner. The people of Iran do not want an authoritarian government and should have all the help they can from all democratic countries in setting up democracy in their own country.",
