We do not have a proper place or monument to hold our Armistice Day Parade, as do other villages in Somerset.  The war memorial hall is now some 85 years old, and it has been the practice of those of the Royal British Legion and others, to stand in the middle of the road, immediately outside the memorial hall, a) to stop the traffic, and b) to hold their short service of remembrance on the 11th day of the 11th month at the eleventh hour.  This petition is raised on the recommendation of John Penrose MP.",
