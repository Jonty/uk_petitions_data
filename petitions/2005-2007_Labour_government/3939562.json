            "background": "We believe that allowing the option to vote for \"NOTA\" will encourage more people to cast a vote in all elections, as a way of expressing dissatisfaction with the offered candidates.  Currently, those who bother will deliberately spoil or 'Protest Vote' their papers, thereby creating a false result.  A NOTA option would allow voters to register their Protest without having to waste a vote, or risk an unrealistic result.  If sufficient people were to exercise this option and NOTA were to poll the highest number of votes, then the election for that Constituency would have to be re-run with a fresh list of candidates that the Electorate would find acceptable.",
