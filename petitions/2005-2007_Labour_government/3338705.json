            "background": "Speeding or erratic driving which seems to have become prevalent amongst young drivers in fast cars consumes greater amounts of fuel and emits more harmful pollutants than driving at a consistent and safe speed. \n\nBy limiting the power and engine capacity to young drivers, you will in effect remove some of the enticement for showcasing their new found driving skills, which sadly statistics show can lead to injury, property damage or even death.\n\nThis proposal would in effect give a safer and cleaner environment for young drivers to develop the intuitions and driving skills that can only come with the experience of time.",
