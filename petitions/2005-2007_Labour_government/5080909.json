            "background": "The Prime Minister has made several visits to Iraq in recent years, but they have always been arranged at the last minute and badly publicised. Now that he is saying his goodbyes, it's only fair that he should visit Baghdad, Basra and other cities in an open-top bus to allow the grateful Iraqi citizens a chance to publicly show their gratitude. Circumstances allowing the tour could then continue to Gaza and Beirut.",
