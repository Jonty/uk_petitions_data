        "action": "Save millions by forbidding government departments from re organising more than once in four years.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is the fashion for new managers to reorganise their new departments. But Government departments can only be organised in half a dozen or so ways and still function. So eventually departments return to the way they were maybe ten years ago. Meantime a lot of money has been spent on constant reorganisation.\nI believe that re organising desks and departments with new phone and computer links, letter heads, rubber stamps, file systems, computer programmes, phone books, identity cards, postal addresses, management and graphic consultants, logos, road and corridor signs, flags, business cards etc, could be seen as a waste of public funds.\nI also know that change can be needed for real efficiency. Therefore I think departments should be allowed four years to see if the current system is working before the next changes are introduced.",
