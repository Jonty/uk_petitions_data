            "background": "One of the biggest road blocks to third party organizing in Great Britain is our system of winner-takes-all elections. Our government of single-member constituencies leads naturally to the dominance of only major parties.\n\nThe solution to this problem is Instant Run-off Voting or IRV (also known as Alternative Voting). IRV systems allow for multiple candidates, while still guaranteeing that the winner will have at least 50% of the final vote, and that everybody\u2019s vote counts.\n\nFind out more about this democratic alternative at:\nhttp://www.avivadirectory.com/petition/",
