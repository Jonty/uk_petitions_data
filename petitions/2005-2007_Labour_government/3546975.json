            "background": "Cornwall County Council has a budget deficit for 2007/08 and therefore County Departments such as the Fire Service will recieve less as a base budget. The money recieved is less than it needs to match the current service it provides. \nThe shortage in funds will lead to the downgrading of Camborne and Falmouth Fire Stations. The stations will go from being staffed 24 hours a day to being staffed between the hours of 08:00 and 18:00, after which the cover will be provided by retained personnel. This will increase response times by at least 5 minutes. This will have a detrimental effect on the surrounding areas and the rest of Cornwall.\nCamborne and Falmouth are the only stations in Cornwall staffed 24 hours a day and provide the only guaranteed response throughout Cornwall at night. These staions are also home to specialist vehicles that respond to designated emergencies locally and nationally.",
