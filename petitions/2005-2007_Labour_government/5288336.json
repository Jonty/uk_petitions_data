            "background": "October 17th, the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty, aims to inspire countless peaceful gatherings and acts of solidarity around the World.  All sectors of society should join forces with those who have been excluded to rebuild our democracies, our attitudes, our behaviours, and our lives together.\n\nWe need to promote respect for the dignity of all people, and their access to human rights, so that those living in extreme poverty and exclusion can participate fully in their societies.  We should observe October 17 as a day to listen to the poorest as they are the most knowledgeable about poverty.\n\nWe need 1 million signatures so please get your family and friends to sign this or the ATD Fourth World \"COUNT ME IN\" campaign available on the World Wide Web",
