            "background": "The goverment drive around in cars that pollute the air more as they do less MPG than most 4x4s. They do nothing to stop rants about 4x4 name calling i.e. gas guzzlers which divides road users and don't see any bigger picture apart from lining their pockets. Increasing road tax for 4x4's is not the answer. Most 4x4's are shorter than most road cars so take up less room on the road and have better CO2 and mpg stats than most 2 litre plus cars. Why penalise us, why listen to groups of individuals who basicaly hate 4x4 users. Freedom of speech, freedom of car. There are other vechiles on the road that DO take up more room and DO have bad emissions, don't penalise 1 group.",
