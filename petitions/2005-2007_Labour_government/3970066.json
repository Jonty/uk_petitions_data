        "background": "it sounds unfair to me that people will be assessed on what is in the area people live in. It has been worked out that only 18% of the population won't be affected by this. This is too small amount of people. Nearly everyone has access to a bus stop, park, train line, shops, nice view, telephone box etc. A lot of the population have drive ways, garages and house extensions. Lets stop Tony Blair from doing this. If this sounds extreme and you would be right to say hang on this is not so extreme at the moment, I think it can be, don't be fooled. Its giving them greater access to us and how much more money can they take away from us?",
