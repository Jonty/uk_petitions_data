Posters such as these would be invaluable today to remind people about climate change and to urge them to take action.\n\nSoon, many, like in the war, will feel obliged to do their bit and as climate change is not on the majority of people\u2019s minds most of the time, posters will help to remind them that a catastrophe is just around the corner and that they CAN do something about it by turning off the light ('put that light out'), by not leaving the computer on all night, by using their car less ('is your journey really necessary?') etc.\n\nPosters will help to make climate change issues at the heart of everyday life.\n\nPosters such as 'is your journey really necessary?' may help to just make people stop and think twice before they travel.\n\n'Global warming is real. Help stop it now. Are you doing your bit?'\n\nLet's do it with poster power!",
