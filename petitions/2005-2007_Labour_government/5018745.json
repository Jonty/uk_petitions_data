            "background": "Before the outbreak of \"mad cow disease\", animal slaughter was done via a bolt through the head after stunning the animal, the goverment decided this was costing too much time and money as the bolts had to be sterilized after each slaughter to minimise the risks thus resulting in the \"PAINFUL, LONG BLOODY MURDER\" of animals when we all know the goverment spend vast amounts of money on things that don't need money spent!!!!! WOULD YOU LIKE YOUR CHILD TO HAVE THEIR THROAT SLICED, HAVE THEIR WINDPIPE AND TRACHEA RIPPED OUT AND THROWN AWAY, THEN TO BE CAST ASIDE TO BLEED TO DEATH IN PAIN WHILE THE NEXT CHILD IS PREPARED FOR THE SAME FATE????????? \nNO?????????? Thought not, so what makes us think that it's perfectly acceptable to do this to another life....human or not? these animals still feel fear and pain, if we MUST kill these living enitities AT LEAST make it more bearable for the poor defensless creature.\n\nPLEASE I urge you to sign below if you agree.....Thank you\n\nx",
