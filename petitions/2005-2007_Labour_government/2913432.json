            "background": "If the punishment should fit the crime how can a charge of around 200 pounds in some circumstances be justified for parking for a couple of minutes on a side street during the day while people are at work.  Car Clamping is just as bad as banks taking days to clear funds...its just another way for the govenrment to suck the public's finances dry...and then they wander why the economy isn't growing as fast as before...its because there are so many petty fines and charges that we have to deal with that we have no money to buy anything!\nJoin in me in making our voice heard and sign up to get car clamping banned in England and Wales.",
