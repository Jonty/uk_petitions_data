            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We the undersigned believe the state should not intervene in matters of personal choice and should decriminalise polygamous marriage where both parties consent to such marriage. Polygamy is a recognised form of marriage within at least one of the major religions of the world and the state has no right to moralise as to its correctness particularly in an age where official recognition is given to other forms of relationships which have historically been considered morally incorrect. We the undersigned believe that women who enter into marriage as co-wives have a right to be recognized in English law as being part of a marital relationship as this would provide protection for such women and the offspring of such marriages. We the undersigned believe such marriages can not be considered \"exploitative\" in comparison to the many men and women who have multiple \"girlfriends\" / \"boyfriends\" at the same time absent the protection and loyalty of a family life and the religious principles which protect the participants of many plural marriages.",
