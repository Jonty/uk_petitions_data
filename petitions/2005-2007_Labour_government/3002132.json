            "background": "Cat owners should be accountable for their animals. As a home owner I am fed up with finding cat poo in my garden & having these creatures roam over my property. They should all be Chipped & Collared, any owners of cats that were caught on the streets after 21:00 hours should have to pay a fixed penalty fine. All cats should be neutered & a licence needed to breed & sell them. Owners should be responsible for toilet training their beasts and again, a fine should be imposed for innapropriate defecation.",
