At least a third of the spectrum capacity between 470MHz and 862MHz should be set aside to enable the 5 terrestrial channels to provide HD broadcasts. The proposal by Ofcom to auction off a huge slice of the airwaves ahead of analogue 'switch-off' would leave them unable to offer HD, with it's superior picture and sound, to Freeview viewers.",
