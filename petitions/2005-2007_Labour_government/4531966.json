Single people - perhaps widowed, divorced or just happily single are being 'robbed' by the unjust single supplement added onto their holidays.  In many cases it means that the single person cannot afford to go on the holiday selected because it can increase their holiday cost by %50-100% and this is just to stay in (99% on the time) a very small cupboard-like room.  This is out and out discrimination!",
