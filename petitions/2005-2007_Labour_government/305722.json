It doesn't change the fact that the crime has been committed, or the effect on the victim's loved ones, and is obviously done only for revenge.  It has NO \"deterrent\" effect; otherwise areas of the U.S., and other countries, which practise it would be crime-free instead of which we occasionally learn of a specific U.S. state having executed its 1000th prisoner.  Capital punishment has no place in a civilised country; or, indeed, any country.",
