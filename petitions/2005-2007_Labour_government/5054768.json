            "background": "Terrence Bonds of Strood is refusing to get his hair cut. It has now been some 18 months since his last visit to Aunt Pat. His friends and colleagues demand that Terrence makes the call to his Aunt and books himself an appointment, as his hair is now the second longest in the office behind a lady. We do not expect the Prime Minister to exert pressure on Terrence to go for a number one all over, but something neat and tidy with a little left over his collar and ears would be ideal. Please sign and help us to help Terrence.",
