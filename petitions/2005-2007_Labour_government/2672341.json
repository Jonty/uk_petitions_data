            "background": "BMW \"drivers\" (I use the word advisedly) are a menace on the road. The fabled no indication at junctions, the trying to turn a single lane road into a dual carriageway, and many other misdemeanours - I'm sure you can think up many of your own. My proposal is that BMW drivers should first of all be charged at least quadruple the road tax they would have been charged if they had bought a car with more standard extras - ie. indicators and side windows. Hopefully the simplicity of this petition will make it blatantly obvious that it should be passed into law.",
