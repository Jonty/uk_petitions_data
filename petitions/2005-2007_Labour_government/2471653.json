It must be nurtured at the roots. \n\nThe trade union movement in Iraq forms a vital, broadly based and non-sectarian front in the struggle to construct civic society. It brings Iraqis together to fight for the common interest of all Iraqis, not just the narrow, chauvinistic interests of Shia or Sunni.\n\nWe should show solidarity with our brothers and sisters in the movement, defending them from attack (from both governmental and non-governmental sources) and providing them with the moral and material support they require to help build a democratic and stable Iraq.",
