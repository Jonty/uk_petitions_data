            "background": "Somalia has been a turmoil and apathy for over 16 years.  The World has either chosen to ignore it or when it decides to do something about it, it further complicates the situation. A great example of it today, where World organisation and major countries like US and UK have condoned, encouraged and indirectly or directly funded  the invasion of Somalia by Ethiopia. To say they had  the well being of Somali State in their mind would clearly be off mark. However  , though a grave mistake was made the situation cannot and should not be let to continue. And unless  the World  addresses  the situation ion Somalia now it will evaporate and expand to uncontrollable stage and expand to  the region.",
