            "background": "I am fed up with the government and other authorotive figures either banning, or trying to ban things e.g. fireworks, replica weapons, violent computer games, hoodies, children playing conkers e.t.c. We are living in a nanny state which is getting worse every day. My proposal, although a contradiction in itself, is to ban banning things. Believe it or not, banning rarely solves anything, although I think that banning the act of banning things will help our country tremendously, by being the last thing to be banned. Recently on the news I saw that one school has banned children playing tig WTF???!!!!! HOW IS TIG DANGEROUS???????\nAnyway, I could go on about this for ages!!!\n\nPS Will the last person to leave turn off the light??",
