            "background": "My daughter has Aspergers. She had a terrible time within the UK education system. I had to fight for every little thing, often getting nowhere. She missed months and months off school which did not understand her problems and needs and could not support her. Her education was therefore delayed. She is now at college and has achieved at long last 5 GCSEs. She is now studying one A level. She is very bright, but cannot cope with too many things at once. She panics. She can do A level, but one at a time. She is older than the others in her group. She may not get the funding to complete her A level because she will be \"too old\". It is not her fault she is at college later than usual. Parents of children with SENs should not have to fight yet again at this stage, because their child is \"too old\", (she is 19 now), to get the education their child needs.",
