            "background": "There is widespread and deserved contempt for politicians that has arisen through their craven support for a policy concensus driven by the popular media and a cynical view of electoral benefit.  This could be counteracted by an unequivocal declaration that PMs who lie would face the consequences if, for example, deliberate misinformation was used to support US business interests in the ME.  The public administration of an appropriate physical corrective rebuke would undo the damage to our international standing and restore some degree of confidence in the political process within the UK community",
