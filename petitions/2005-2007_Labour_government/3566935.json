Sentences should be heavier and should be for far longer terms of imprisonment meaning even \"LIFE\" if found guilty of manslaughter.  Today's laws are too lenient and do not act as a deterent for the mindless minority that flout road traffic laws and get off lightly, the victims and families are the ones \"SERVING\" the life sentences not the \"DRIVER\".Terms of imprisonment should be heavier in relation to the crime comitted.",
