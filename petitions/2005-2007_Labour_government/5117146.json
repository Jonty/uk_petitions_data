            "background": "I was surprised and disgusted to hear on the BBC radio on Friday evening 25 May that a Gurkha veteran, resident in Nepal has been refused permission to move to the UK. Apparently his application was refused by an official at the British Embassy in Kathmandu on the grounds that he did not have sufficient grounds.\nThis elderly veteran fought for this country, as thousands of his countrymen did and are doing, many of whom died. He  is already shabbily treated in respect of his pension but he should be allowed to immigrate to what he must consider to be his Mother country.",
