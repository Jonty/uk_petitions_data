            "background": "you may not agree with this but boxing is a sport known to increase self confidence, reduce stress, and reduce crime.\n\ni am asking you to reintroduce boxing into secondary schools, not as a compulsory thing but as a club at lunch or after school times etc.\n\nthere is no actual health and safety dangers to boxing as long as proper gloves, headgear and supervision is included and i believe many teachers would agree with my idea of reintroducing the sport and would be willing to participate in the teaching of it.\n\nit is one of the most physically demanding sports on offer and would greatly help with the younger generations fitness for later life and would help the fitness of the country in general. \ncrime would be reduced as it reduces stress and would lower the percentage of people lashing out in anger.\n\nall in all i believe that simply bringing back the sport would improve the country as a whole.",
