            "background": "Gordon Brown will inherit leadership of the country within a week, without any public approval. We voted for Tony Blair and he has left - why is the leadership of the country being \"handed down\" to Brown with such disregard? We are supposed to live in a democracy, leaders are meant to be voted for by the people.\n\nHe will refuse to call an election himself because he knows, as does the rest of the country, that he cannot win an election. Therefore I urgently call upon the Prime Minister to call a general election immediately to stop this absolute reversal of democracy from happening.",
