            "background": "currently the CSA only take non-resident parents income into consideration and do not consider any bills they may have eg, rent, mortgage, council tax etc. Also they should only base how much you have to pay on your basic income and not your over time allowing non-resident parents to make up any loss in earnings (taken by the CSA) of their own free will. Currently they do not leave non-resident parents with enough money to live or even take their children out when they have them. I think the whole CSA system is wrong and needs reviewing NOW!.",
