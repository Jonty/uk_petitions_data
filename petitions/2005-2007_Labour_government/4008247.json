        "background": "With the government urging people to turn green, why are people still getting fined for cycling on the path? Many people choose to cycle on the path due to the poor quality of the roadsides in this country and due to drains, narrow roads, dangerous drivers, so on so forth. So I ask please lift the ban on cycling on the path to help the safety of the people, improve the fitness of people, and to help this country turn green.",
