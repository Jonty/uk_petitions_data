            "background": "I have been informed I have to request permission to have my budgie in my newly bought flat.  This contradicts what the Housing Association said when we bought the flat.  We have since been advised that we must put a request in writing to the tenants committee requesting a budgie in our home.  This I believe is unjust, we own our flat, the bird is caged, causes no mess, I mean what harm can a budgie do for petes sake.  It cannot be said that the budgie is noisey as we live on a tree lined road with birds singing all day.  Please aid my petition to keep our little friend without any interference from other people.",
