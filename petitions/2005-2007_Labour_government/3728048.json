            "background": "It is unexceptiable that healthy people who live an active life and work hard for this country should be charged the same amount for use of the NHS as people whos lifestyle choices directly contribute to their need for medical attention. \nFor instance people who live unhealthily and get no excersice and then burden the NHS should have to pay for their treatment as it is their fault they are ill. \nIt is unfair for instance that people who do their best to keep healthy have to pay, for instance, for dental treatment, whilst somebody who sits watching television and eating burgers can get treatment for heart disease for free when it was surely obvious to them they were putting themselves at risk. \nI propose we begin to charge certain people for basically abusing the NHS.",
