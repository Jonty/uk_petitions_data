        "background": "Most religious Adoption Societies have been around for many years, and have a lot of expertise in dealing with adoption of children.It would be a  pity to crush their long term contribution to child welfare,due to their inability to assess Gay couples, bearing in mind that Gay people wishing to adopt can be assessed by Social Services Adoption Teams.\nWe speak from past experience, as we  were both adopted in our infancy, and have had identity problems later, though each brought up by a man and woman. This commonplace state of affairs  for adoptees would have been compounded for each of us, if brought up by a same sex couple.\nPlease consider adopted people's rights:babies and small children cannot speak for themselves, and people who have not been adopted cannot always appreciate the complex lifelong  identity issues for many adopted people.\nFaith Adoption societies should not be phased out until these issues are understood by all who deal with adoption, and people in the community are more tolerant of different lifestyles.Ten years might be a more realistic time-frame for phasing them out than two years.",
