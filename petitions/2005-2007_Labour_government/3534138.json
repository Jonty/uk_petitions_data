        "background": "Massive computer databases for Health, Home Office (ID cards etc), Revenue and customs, Education and DVLA, are reasonable developments of technology to make Governance more efficient.  BUT, any attempt to link all these information sources electronically within a common information infrastructure will deliver the single greatest attack on civil liberties and personal freedom and individual privacy the world has ever seen. Immediately, every low level civil servant in any Government agency could potentially be given the ability to draw together indicators that will completely open up an individual's life to scrutiny. This would be wholly unacceptable.  Cast iron guarantees that information shared between the bodies of State will always be under some form of judicial warrant MUST be in place before the first link up is put in place. The Information Commissioner has raised these issues but it is now time for us all to make our feelings known before some critical changes are in place.",
