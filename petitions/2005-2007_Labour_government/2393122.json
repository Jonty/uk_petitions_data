            "background": "I would introduce the use of GPS tracking systems in cars for new drivers aged 17 to 25 to monitor and prevent speeding. There would be a 1 year period for new young drivers for daytime travel. For night travel the GPS would monitor the speed of all individuals aged 17 to 21. Additionally for night travel, some locations would also be outlawed - (e.g. The Beach Boulivard Aberdeen). Automatic fines would be imposed if speed limits thresholds or area limits are broken more than 4 times a month.",
