Can anyone still go on it and be naive, I believe so.\nBig Brother exploits people, it sets things up that clearly treats human beings very poorly and without dignity.\nI do not genuinely believe, especially the celebrity one that people realize the potential damage that taking part in such a show can produce.\nThis was all to obvious in the recent disgraceful celebrity BB in January 2007.\nBig Brother does not seem to care if people are humiliated and have there lives totally ruined, all in the name of entertainment, rather viewing figures at all costs.",
