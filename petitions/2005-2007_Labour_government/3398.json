        "action": "Raise the legal age for buying tobacco products to 18 and increase the penalties to retailers who break this rule.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In addition to the ban on smoking in public places which is due to come into force in 2007, the signatories of this petition would like to see the legal age to purchase tobacco products in the UK raised to 18. This should deter younger people from taking up the habit at a time of life when they are most vulnerable.\n\nA recent article on the BBC website stated: 'raising the legal age would make it easier for retailers to spot under-age smokers and lead to a fall in the number of teenagers who get addicted.' The article went on to state that: 'someone who starts smoking at the age of 15 is three times more likely to die of cancer due to smoking than someone who starts in their late 20s.",
