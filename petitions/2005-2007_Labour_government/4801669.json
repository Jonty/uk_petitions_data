        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Stuart Hall is by far and away the best sports commentator in the country. He is the man whose matches, even if it's Tranmere Vs Walsall, we always look forward to hearing about on 'Sports Report', probably the reason some of us tune in. His fantastic and vivid depictions of teams fighting 'a Gladitorial battle in a modern day colleseum' or full backs crowding out diminuitive strikers like 'they were wolves around a lamb' are fantastic. And they make the John Motsons and Tony Gubbas of this world look spectacularly average. So when the European Championship comes around, lets make sure it's Stuart Hall's voice and metaphors livening up the final and not Motson's mistake ridden drawl. Support this motion!",
