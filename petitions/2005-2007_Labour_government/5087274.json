        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There have been several proposals recently to tighten television regulation and restrict certain forms of pornography; reasoning behind such proposals points to inconclusive evidence of the negative effects of certain content, and the preservation of society\u2019s values. This is unacceptable. People should be free to make up their own minds about what values and morals they adhere to, and there is no conclusive evidence that violence on television causes violence in real life, or that sex can cause any harm at all. The government should not act paternalistically and should make no attempts to interfere with the freedom of expression of individuals. Filmmakers and makers of television programmes should be free to create whatever they like as long as no-one is being physically or mentally harmed. People should be free to watch whatever they like, in films, on television, on the web, as long as sufficient warnings are put in place to protect children and inform those who may be offended. The Obscene Publications Act is a piece of law that is vastly outdated, and should be repealed, particularly in the light of freedom of expression provided under the Human Rights Act.",
