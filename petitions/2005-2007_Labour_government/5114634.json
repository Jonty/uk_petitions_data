        "action": "fine manufacturers for creating excessive packaging, both in terms of size, quantity and quality, instead of consumers",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Who really creates the waste in society? Consumers buy the products but the manufacturers create and package them. Is it our (the consumers) fault that we need to buy food which is packaged in multiple layers, computer ink cartridges and batteries in heavyweight plastic A4 sleeves covering a miniscule (by comparison) product.  We petition the govenment to make manufacturers use sensible packaging in terms of material, size and recyclability, and to fine at source  those that continue to produce grossly excessive and non-recylable packaging.  We petitioin the Government to stop hitting the end user, who happens to have to dispose of this rubbish, particularly through fines and bin cameras.  Believe us  we'd be happy to have a 3\"x3\" recyclable cardboard carton on our ink cartridge, or a greaseproof sleeve round our ham instead of heavy duty plastic which is impossible to open anyway.\nGet real, do a deal and force manufacturers and distributers to wrap it to scrap it - effectively!",
