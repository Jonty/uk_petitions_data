        "action": "abandon the current system of BST/GMT. We request a move to GMT+2/GMT+1 which would reduce UK carbon dioxide emissions, save energy, facilitate business with Europe, and boost tourism. This move would also improve the fitness and enhance the well being of UK citizens, with lighter evenings encouraging greater outdoor activity, and avoid the incalculable costs of unnecessary road deaths and injuries, associated with earlier darkness under GMT.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition seeks to rally public support behind this change. Recent research by Cambridge University has estimated the cost of the current system to be 4 million MW-Hrs and 1.7 Million tons of CO2 over the last decade. On road accidents, ROSPA show that the move would lead to around 450 fewer deaths and serious injuries a year, including between 104 and 138 fewer deaths. Over the 35 years of darker than necessary evenings the NHS may have incurred costs of \u00a37b. There are many summer activities that are restricted in time, tennis,  golf, sailing, playing with your kids etc \u2013 this change would lead to a more active and healthier society. In the US they have already taken action, backed up by research, to reduce energy consumption by increasing the number of weeks of daylight saving time. US representative Edward Markey cited similar arguments to support the US changes and also said \"Ultimately, daylight saving just brings a smile to everybody's faces.\" \nLighterevenings has a website with more detail on it.",
