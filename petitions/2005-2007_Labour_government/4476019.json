            "background": "As we, the Great British public, will have no say in this matter we urge Tony Blair to formally encourage any challenger to take on Gordon Brown when the leadership is eventually up for grabs. Most people in this country do not want Gordon Brown to become Prime Minister, we are not saying Tony is the best but he is an awful lot better than Brown the Frown. Sign the petition and stop an unfair coronation taking place and Gordon getting the privelidge to be able to do whatever he likes for the next two years (which will probably include an awful lot of spin and stealth taxes) Gordon Brown will ruin our country, and he probably won't even be able to serve as prime minister once the SNP gets their way, so say NO to GB and say YES to Great Britain !!! (minus Scotland if they choose to leave)",
