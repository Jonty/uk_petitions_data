At present, defendants sit in the dock and cannot easily communicate with their legal team, for example when they spot a witness' lie that can easily be disproved by a \u2018snap\u2019 question.  Often the defendant may not be able to communicate with their Barrister until after the lying witness has left \u2013 at which point it is too late.  Wrongful convictions result.",
