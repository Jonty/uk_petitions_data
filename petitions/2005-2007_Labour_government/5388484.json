            "background": "We wish the government to make all public owned swimming pools keep at least 50 % of the pool  open to the public between 5pm and 9pm so that working people can access swimming pools after work. At the moment swimming clubs can take the whole pool up in the evening  for the whole  night which prevents working families from using this public facility   . As in the case of Yate swimming pool in South Glos.",
