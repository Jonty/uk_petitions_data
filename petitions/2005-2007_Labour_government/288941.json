            "background": "As we all know much of the current bias BBC Question Time program panellists are selected by editors and the establishment, and who`s views are often out of line with true public opinion.\n\nSeeing that most of us financially contribute to TV licensing, my idea is to create a peak time nightly 1 hour Question Time programm whereby the panellists are made up from members of the public, but the audience is made up of others like politicians, authors, lectures, magazine editors, religious groups, left wing comediens etc.\n\nLet the current BBC program run first, and then follow it up with the public program.\n\nLets see who debates the best solutions to the same problems, and who turns up from the establishment in the audience.\n\nWe could also have some shows where the panellists come from minor groups of political or non political organistaions, plus we could create 2 hour specials programs on specific topics of the public choice.\n\nA bit closer to true TV democracy don`t you think!!!!",
