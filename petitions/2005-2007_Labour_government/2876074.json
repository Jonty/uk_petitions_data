            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Given that water is an essential and uniform commodity, where consumers have no choice of supplier and prices are controlled by a regulatory body, we believe that there is no moral or logical argument for domestic metered consumers in different areas of the country to be charged different prices for it.\n\nWe propose that as a matter of social justice, the price of water at the tap should no longer be dictated by a \"postcode lottery\", but that all domestic consumers across England should pay the same price for a litre of water delivered through a meter - even if that involves price increases in some areas to allow reductions in others, in order to make the measure cost neutral to central government.\n\nPlease note that the introduction of this system should not necessarily rule out concessions based on the ability to pay, for example for pensioners.",
