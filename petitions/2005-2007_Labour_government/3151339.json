On the spot fines should be handed to those who choose to act in this anti-social manner.\n\nWe have all been there. Loud and often annoying music blaring from a mobile phone - it's incredibly annoying and something needs to be done as many people are often too scared to say anything. Fines need to be introduced to stamp this growing craze of playing music out loud from mobile phones.",
