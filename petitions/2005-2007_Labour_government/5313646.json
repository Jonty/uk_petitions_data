Not only that, but to add insult to injury, the English are paying for the Scots to have this luxury! It should be one rule for all.  If the Scots want to be ruled by a different government then they should pay for their own entitlements, and not make the English do it.  \n\nI petition not just the Prime Minister, but EVERY MP who believes in fairness and justice!   (For all!) Thank you",
