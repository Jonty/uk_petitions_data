            "background": "religion has always been seen a problem in northern ireland. but today we still find many schools are either catholic schools or protestant schools. i feel that if people of northern ireland want any sort of future for their children they will have to let their children grow up in an education system were they are taught how to treat everyone equally, therefore i beleive it would be better to have all schools being the equivalent of integrated schools. this also means the abolishment of schools run by members of the religious community, eg, nuns, priests etc.",
