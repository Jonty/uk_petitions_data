However it IS possible for Scottish and Welsh MP's to vote in the Commons on issues that only affect and concern England. Therefore we request that an assembly be set up to combat these English issues like those in Edinburgh and Cardiff. England has a right to rule itself as much as Scotland and Wales do.",
