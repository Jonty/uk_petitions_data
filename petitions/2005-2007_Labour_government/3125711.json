            "background": "It is all very well taxing car owners via petrol, road tax etc to discourage using them but for this to work a cost equivalent public service should be available instead. Currently there is no encouragement to use trains for example as it costs twice as much compared to driving yourself, and of course you don't have to pay more for additional passengers.\n\nTrain tickets (in particular) need to reflect the equivalent cost of travelling yourself. This would help the environment, improve congestion and of course actaully promote the use of public transport despite its inconvenience compared to conventional means.",
