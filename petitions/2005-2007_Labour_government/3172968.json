            "background": "Besides being disgusting cat faeces is also harmful.  It is a public health issue.  Toxoplasmosis is a microscopic parasite that can affect all mammals, including man, as well as birds, amphibians and other reptiles. The cat is the definitive host.  Dog owners have an obligation through legislation to remove their dog faeces wherever it is deposited and I would therefore suggest that the same should apply to cat owners.  Anyone is at risk including young children out playing and inadvertently coming into contact with this vile waste product.",
