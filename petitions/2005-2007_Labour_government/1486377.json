            "background": "Assistive Technology is a life line to some people with disabilities providing access to many things that most people consider a fundamental human right -  communication, access to education and control of one's environment to name a few.  Stephen Hawking is a clich\u00e9d example of an effective Assistive Technology user. \n\nThere is no consistent, or coherent provision of Assistive Technology in the UK and a number of services have recently suffered from Government support being withdrawn - e.g. the ACE Centres (supporting children with communication difficulties in education); BECTA's SEN IT Team (supporting access to the curriculum for students with special needs); CAP program (funding communication aids for children) and FAST (developing and innovating in the Assistive Technology field).  \n\nWe the undersigned request that dedicated funding is provided across sectors to enable Assistive Technology to be provided where needed and support the existing teams.",
