            "background": "Why should we taxpayers have our money taken away and given to organizations we find objectionable?   \n\nOur money will be given to those who fielded the largest numbers of candidates previous years no matter how discredited or how badly they have failed.  \n\nThis undermines democratic accountability and prevents natural change.  Far from stopping corruption, this proposal could pay the corrupt to carry on.\n\nThe correct solution is to limit the spending and cut the spin. All we need to know is the manifesto.\n\nWe, the undersigned, want a frugal limit to spending for all parties. We do not want to fund through taxation campaigns we do not support.  \n\n(This measure, of course, also requires the candid publication of all donations, loans and expenditure and honours should be given only to those who have not donated or loaned.)",
