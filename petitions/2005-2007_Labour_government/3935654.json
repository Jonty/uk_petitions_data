            "background": "I request that Warrington be reconsidered to become a City. Over the past 50 years Warrington has grown from a small market town to a place where over 196,500 now live. Warrington is a place that is on the up with regeneration plans in place to revamp the current town centre with more retail units, offices, apartments, cafes, bars and multi-screen cinemas. This is hoped to bring back many locals to the heart of Warrington.\n\nWarrington has excellent transport links to and from the major cities in the North of England.\n\nWarrington has an excellent employment rate and also is home to many of the UK's largest companies being BT, Vodafone, United Utilites and Airmiles just some to mention. Warrington is also home to one of the Uk's first Ikea stores which attracts many people to the town from all over the North West. Warrington is also home to the Omega site which is set to be developed over the 20 years into the biggest retail and business park in Europe.\n\nWarrington has a great link with Peace in Northern Ireland thanks to the Peace Centre being built after the 1993 IRA bombing of Warrington Town Centre. Make Warrington a \"City for peace\"!",
