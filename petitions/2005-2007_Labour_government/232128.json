            "background": "The CSA is an unfair and unjust system right now, and the proposed changes will make it worse still. The folllowing issues need addressing:\n\n1. Currently, many women lie to get pregnant with no intention of involving the father except to take his money.\n\n2. It is currently perfectly legal for a woman to not inform a father of his child for many years, but then still reappear at any point to claim maintenance.\n\n3. A women may name any man she chooses as the father, and he must prove his innocence by paying for a test.\n\n4. Men are treated unfairly in family court, and so are often forced to pay for children they never see.\n\nThe system needs changing to make women such as these responsible for their horrific actions which are destroying the lives of many throughout the country.\n\nDue to the many complication involved, assessing every case individually and with respect to the rights of both parties is the only fair way to deal with such scenarios.",
