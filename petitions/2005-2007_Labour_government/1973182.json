            "background": "The M6 toll was supposed to benefit the local economy and the environment by sharing the load on the vastly over-used M6. It currently does neither, as the cost has gone up from \u00a32 in December 2003 to \u00a34 on Jan 1st, 2007. This for a journey of around 20 miles! Once again, British motorists are charged vastly more than any other toll scheme in Europe, while going about thier business of generating ecenomic activity for the UK economy.",
