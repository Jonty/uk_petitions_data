        "background": "The decision to proceed with Crossrail cannot be delayed any further.  London's economy and population are continuing to grow and its existing transport system is already over-stretched.  The case for the urgent construction of Crossrail is overwhelming.  A Bill for Crossrail is being taken through Parliament, but the main outstanding issue is funding.  HM Treasury just have to accept that funding must be found now to ensure that the construction of this vital and the single most important contribution to London's infrastructure suffers no further delay.",
