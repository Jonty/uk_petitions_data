        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The recent example of anti-terrorist raids being immediately followed up in the press with lurid, sensationalist headlines about \"plot to publicly behead British Muslim soldier\" have brought shame on Britain. Even if the raids are based on intelligence, intelligence can be wrong. Remember Iraq's WMDs? It is irresponsible for inflammatory stories to be published when sensitive enquiries are under way. Not only do they prejudice any prospect of a fair trial, but they make Britain appear to be a nation of uneducated, racist savages. And the evidence (from newspaper sources and elsewhere) is that these tip-offs originated from the Police and/or the Home Office and/or Downing Street. For a so-called democratic Government to behave in this way is inexcusable. Propaganda is the domain of the Nazis, not the elected British Government. This practice must be stopped, and those responsible should be found and face disciplinary action.",
