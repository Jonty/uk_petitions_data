But we are leading the way in being greener because we are taxed higher! Why should we lead the world in being green its time to listen to us \"the people\" let another country lead, tax is way to high and we are not seeing anything for it, no one would mind paying higher tax if we could see improvements and NOT reductions. Put some of the tax towards dental treatment for the ones that can't get to see an NHS dentist. After all that he wants to be Prime Minister. Sounds like a sketch from the young Ones to me\u2026. \nJust sign you know it makes sense and they will have to listen.",
