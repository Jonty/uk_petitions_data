            "background": "Ok, its been a long time since I went to church, but last time I did go to church, was with my ex partner, and he was a camera man at the Metropolitan church in the area, quite big church, broadcasts on tv and such, and he had to keep his orientation secret, for fear of loosing friends, and loosing his place as camera man, which was a volunteer job none-the-less. The two times i did attend this church, not a single sentance was spoken, where gays were not called Sinners, and regarded as somthing of the bottom of your shoe. This deeply offended me, and the church, which I attended, with an open mind, felt more like a cult, as everyone shouted \"Praise be!!\" as the Reverend continued his \"Anti-Gay Speech\"\n\nI would like public speeches, inside church, as well as outside, to be governed by the same laws, and that anything racial, or anti-gay/lesbian, to be considered illegal and treated as a hate crime.",
