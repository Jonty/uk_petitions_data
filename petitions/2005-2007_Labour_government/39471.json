            "background": "Every council in this country has their own standard for; what is allowed as refuse, what is recycled, what refuse is allowed in each bin, what colour bin is for each type of refuse and even sizes/styles of bins.  This leads to much confusion for householders for what is allowed in each colour bin, and must be a huge cost for each council formulating their own refuse/recycling systems, each buying their own style of bin and their own standard of collection lorry, etc etc.  Standardise the lot, increase recycling and save millions on household council bills.",
