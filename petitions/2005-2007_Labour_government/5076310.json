            "background": "The government said all homes would require an Energy Performance Certificate (EPC) from June 1st.  Thousands of us did what the government wanted and trained as Domestic Energy Assessors (DEAs) at a cost of several thousand pounds.\n\nThe government has now delayed implementation until August 1st and initially restricted the requirement to 4-bed homes and larger.\n\nBy 1st August there will be some 5000 fully trained and accredited DEAs chasing less than 10% of the promised work.  This equates to just 2 EPCs per month per DEA providing income of maybe \u00a3150.\n\nFor thousands of DEAs this spells financial disaster.  Many have given up their job to undergo the training.  Many have invested their life-savings, redundancy money or early retirement payment to fund the course.  Many have borrowed money and are now in debt.\n\nWe therefore petition the government to provide appropriate financial compensation to all DEAs, both qualified and in training, from June 1st or the date of their accreditation if later to the date when EPCs are finally required by all homes.",
