Founded in 1894 it has a unique cultural standing and is of great historical value. The landowners are proposing a substantial rent increase to allow a number of high street chains to takeover the location and create yet another generic high street.\n \nMusic plays a substantial weight in the cultural make up of the UK and a huge contribution to its balance of payments. A record shop is an important and vital part of the music chain.\n\nSupport Spillers!",
