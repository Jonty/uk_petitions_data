We demand that you allow the public the fundamental right to feel protected and safe. The government has a duty to afford this to us and are currently failing spectacularly in this by allowing Paedophiles to integrate freely and anonymously in our neighbourhoods. We can legally have ASBOS publicised and are made aware of petty criminals who may damage our cars and windows, but when it comes to protecting the most precious thing that we all have we are forced to live in ignorance and danger. GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER MR BLAIR/BROWN/REID .WE WANT SARAH'S LAW NOW. THIS WILL NOT GO AWAY.",
