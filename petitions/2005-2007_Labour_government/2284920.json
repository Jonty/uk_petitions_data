            "background": "The problem with the current CPI or RPI indexes are that it does not reflect the true cost of living for pensioners or those on benefits. Fuel prices make up a much larger proportion of pensioners income and yet they have their pensions based on the prices of items that are falling in price such as flights and consumer electronics. This is the most egregious form of fiscal drag. The government are doomed to failure in all their fuel poverty or children in poverty pledges without creating a low income RPI index and linking pensions and benefits to it.\n\nThis should also be applied to the increase of minimum wage as well other wise the low paid will just get poorer. Inequality is already far too extreme in the UK",
