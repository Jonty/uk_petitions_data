            "background": "Judge Julian Hall has sentenced paedophile Keith Fenn to just 2 years for raping a 10 year old girl because Hall thought the victim dressed \"provocatively\".\n\nFenn could serve as little as 4 months after pleading guilty.\n\nThere can be no justifification for rape, full stop. The fact the victim was  a child makes Hall's remarks even more sickening. Mysogynists like Hall must not be allowed to be a part of our justice system.\n\nYou can read more about this at BBC News http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/6237480.stm or at Oxford Mail http://www.oxfordmail.net/display.var.1494590.0.judge_claims_paedophile_victim_dressed_provocatively.php",
