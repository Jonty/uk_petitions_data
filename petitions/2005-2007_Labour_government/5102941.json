            "background": "Tul Bahadur Pun VC (84) is a former Gurkah soldier living in Nepal. He was awarded the Victoria Cross (the highest recognition for valour \"in the face of the enemy\") for single-handedly storming a Japanese machine gun post in 1944. \nThe following is quoted from the citation: \u201cHis outstanding courage and superb gallantry in the face of odds which meant almost certain death were most inspiring to all ranks and beyond praise\u201d.\nTul Bahadur Pun VC now wishes \u201cto settle the UK to have better access to medication, care and support.\" Despite his service to this country he has been told that he does not have \u201cstrong ties with the UK\u201d and has consequently been denied the right to live here. He requires daily medication for a number of health problems, medication that is not always available where he lives. \nI\u2019m sure you agree that it is disgraceful for a man who has risked his life in defence of the country has been denied the right to live here and receive the support he needs. \nI have placed this petition in the \u201cInternational Affairs and Defence\u201d category as there is no \u201cNational Disgrace\u201d category on this site.",
