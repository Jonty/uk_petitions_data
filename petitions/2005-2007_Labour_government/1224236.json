IT'S GOD'S WARNING:  Check this out Romans 1:24-27 \"Therefore God gave them over in the sinful desires of their hearts to sexual impurity for the degrading of their bodies with one another.They exchanged the truth of God for a lie, and worshipped and served created things rather than the creator - who is forever praised.  Amen.\nBecause of this, God gave them over to shameful lusts.  Even their women exchanged natural relations for un-natural ones.  In the same way, the men also abandoned natural relations with women and were inflamed with lust for one another. Men committed indecent acts with other men, and received in themselves the due penalty for their perversion.\"  WE CANNOT LEGALISE THAT WHICH GOD SPEAKS CLEARLY AGAINST!!",
