        "background": "The government rakes in a fortune from motorists through Road Tax. This is an unfair tax and the majority of private motorists subsidise the heavy commercial users of our roads through this tax burden.\n\nThe heavy commercial users of our roads cause the most damage and should be made to pay more towards the cost of maintaining our roads via the fuel they use.\n\nThis is an unjust tax - we don't pay an extra tax for any of our other fuel usage ie - gas. We pay the tax as we use it. We are not taxed according to the emission rate of the boiler we have at home so why tax us on the emission rate of our engines. \n\nThe Road Fund Licence should be recouped at the pumps through a duty included in the price of a litre of fuel.\n\nIf you drive a gas guzzler then you will pay more in tax - fair.\n\nThis would also encourage people to drive more economical cars and so reduce carbon emissions and help prevent climate change.",
