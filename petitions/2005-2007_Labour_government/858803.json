        "background": "This act gives the government the right to call a state of emergency at any time and enforce martial law under circumstances which are far too generally worded. This is a serious threat to civil liberty and democracy and replicates the law created by the Weimar Republic used by Hitler to consolidate his power, banish all opposition and enforce his dictatorship, something this legislation permits due to the looseness of its wording. Conditions for emergency must be more specific.",
