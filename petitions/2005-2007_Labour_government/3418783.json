SHOULD CREATE A NATIONAL LOTTERY FOR ALL THOSE THAT WORK AND PAY NATIONAL INSURANCE CONTRIBUTIONS.THE PROJECT SHOULD COST NO MORE THAN \u00a31/WEEK GAURANTIED FOR 20 YEARS i e (NO ANNUAL RISES). THE PRIZES SHOULD BE TO THE VALUE OF \u00a3200,000? EACH FOR AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE. FOR THIS ALL WINNERS MUST AGREE TO BE TAKEN OFF THE BENIFITS LIST FOR 12 MONTHS? ( EXCLUDING MAJOR COST MEDICAL CARE )THIS WOULD GIVE THE WORKING MAN A LITTLE HOPE! GOD KNOWS HE NEEDS IT. THE COMBINATIONS OF APPLYING THIS SYSTEM ARE LIMITLESS AND VERY VARIED. I AM OBVIOUSLY BIAS TO MY OPINION BUT I DO THINK SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD MAKE A RATHER NICE CHANGE TO THE REGULAR DOOM AND GLOOM \n                      REGARDS D LANE",
