            "background": "Currently the law states that a person must be employed for one year at a company before they can take their employer to an employment tribunal for unfair dismissal.  There are only a couple of exceptions to this rule including sex dixcrimination.  This does however mean that if you have been employed for under a year, a company may dismiss someone UNFAIRLY and get away with it.  They may also bully and harrass a person causing them to resign; as there is no law to stop them from doing so.  I believe that it does not matter how long someone has been employed; each employee has a right to fair treatment.  The law should therefore be changed to allow anyone to apply as long as they have followed the company grievance procedure, or a maximum time limit of three months if a time limit must be imposed.",
