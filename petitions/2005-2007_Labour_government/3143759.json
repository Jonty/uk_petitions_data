            "background": "We believe that it would be a far better use of the money that would be required to build the new generation of nuclear power stations to fund solar panel provision and installation to every home and business premises in the UK, reducing the power demands on the National Grid, reducing greenhouse emissions and removing the need to maintain and clean up an increasing amout of radioactive waste.  This will also create massive employment around the UK as firms will be created to install and maintain these solar panels.",
