            "background": "This government has made it its policy to create charges and stealth taxes rather than introducing rewards to those who manage to comply with their hair-brained green schemes. Why not, for example, use Congestion Charge money to subsidise the purchase of electric cars? At the moment we are paying more to tread the right path, why not help us make the right choice by making it cheaper to go green than otherwise through incentives rather than penalties. This petition will hopefully encourage action by the government to actually use the 'penalty' money for a related, and worthy cause.",
