            "background": "The British road users pay massive amounts of fuel tax, road tax and MOT. They should not be subjected to pay even more for the usage of Motorways/Main A Roads. Instead, charge the foreign vehicles that enter the UK, and charge a daily useage rate for the Roads. After all, the foreign hauliers DO NOT CONTRIBUTE atall to the British economy, with massive tanks of cheap diesel bought abroad and not paying for road useage.",
