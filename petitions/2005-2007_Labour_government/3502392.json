        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Before 1983, the law stated that children born outside of the United Kingdom or Commonwealth to British mothers and non-British fathers were not entitled to British citizenship, unlike those with a British father - a clear case of sex discrimination in that, for purposes of nationality, women were treated as the property of their husband. A new law took effect on January 1 1983, which no longer discriminated against British mothers in this way; however, this law only applies to children born from that date onwards. In the years 1977 to 1983, the discrimination issue was recognised and allowed children born before 1983 to register for British citizenship, but only those born between February 1 1961 and December 31 1983 and registered while under the age of 18. Sex discrimination is illegal under the European Convention of Human Rights. The 1961 'watershed' date should be removed, allowing all adult children born to British mothers before this date to obtain full UK citizenship.",
