            "background": "This is in opposition to a petition to allow owners of public places to decide whether to allow smoking.  I am opposed to this because it would mean that if any owner decided to allow this all staff, and non-smoking users, of these premises would be subjected to the very well-known risks of passive smoking (this also applies to acute mental health wards for which there is also an anti-ban petition).  Non-smkers (though almost certainly not prospective staff)could just avoid smoky premsies but why should they have to choose between benefiting from whatever services, etc., such premises supply and risking their health?",
