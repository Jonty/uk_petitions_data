        "background": "My brother was knocked over by a joyrider 10 years ago through no fault of his own.  Since the accident, my brother and parents (his full-time carers as inadequate care from homecare agencies)have been denied the opportunity to access high quality rehabilitation and support services, both of which are important for my brother's mental and physical well being.  My parents have also been denied quality support and benefits due to the fact that compensation was received and my father is now not entitled to benefits in his own right due to this factor even though he has worked throughout his life.  He has suffered a heart attack and my mother has anxiety problems through the strain of the situation.  I feel that there are also a large number of family's in Britain experiencing similar situations and i submitting this petition in an an attempt to improve the community services available to people and for the value of the work carried out by carers to be recognised.",
