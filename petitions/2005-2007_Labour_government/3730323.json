            "background": "The study over the years by various sources have indicated that the cultivation of hemp is proven to meet all of our needs e.g Transport, clothing,power stations, food,and many other environmental needs. Also the use of cannabis is proven to be less harmfull than alcohol i.e who was the last person to die from cannabis misuse? Also the cannabis market is being flooded with dangerous imported rubbish usually filled with harmful chemicals. You would complain if your pint was infested with harmful chemicals. Legislation would eradicate these problems.",
