            "background": "\"Beefy\"was the greatest sporting icon of this country in the 1970's and 1980's.He was the hero of many young cricket fans.He achieved 14 test centuries, took 383test and 145one-day international wickets. He remains one of the most inspirational sportsmen that this country has produced. He comes accross as a modest man always willing to acknowledge the talent and spirit of today's cricketers - not like some retired cricketers who always think things and players were better in their era.His sporting background is enough to justify it.  However, his dedication to raising money for Leukaemia Research and the Teenage Cancer Trust makes it more important.When he started his walks, the media assumed it was partly a publicity stunt, maybe it was. However, he has continued to walk for charity.His walk in 2006 has currently raised more than 1/2 million according to the Botham Walk website. Great cricketers of the past have been honoured with knighthoods and yet he remains forgotten about.",
