It is just a fact that we are going through a warming phase in the earth's cycle.  only 10000 years ago we were in an ice age!!!.\n\nIn fact while the ice caps are melting in places, they are freezing in others.\n\nGermans have a power station that throws out 25m tonnes of co2 a year, they want to build 40 more!  \n\nWhy should a country as small as ours be made to pay more than the rest!!! as is usual, more for petrol etc etc.\n\nThese taxes will be used to fund anything but \"green\" measures, stop it now!",
