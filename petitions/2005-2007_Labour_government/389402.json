The cost of public transport can even be more than private transport despite \"environmental duty\"\n\nAs a result, people choose to travel by private modes of transport, causing undesirable environmental effects.\n\nIt makes clear sense, therefore, that off-peak public transport should be free to use at times where vehicles would otherwise run less than 50% full.",
