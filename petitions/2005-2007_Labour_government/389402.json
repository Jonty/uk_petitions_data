        "background": "At off-peak times, public transport vehicles run very near empty, due to being priced for maximum profit not maxium utlisation. The cost of public transport can even be more than private transport despite \"environmental duty\"\n\nAs a result, people choose to travel by private modes of transport, causing undesirable environmental effects.\n\nIt makes clear sense, therefore, that off-peak public transport should be free to use at times where vehicles would otherwise run less than 50% full.",
