            "background": "Road safety cameras can only tackle problems such as speeding and red light jumping in specific localities.\n\nThey do not help to reduce the number of inconsiderate or dangerous drivers on our roads. Nor do they reduce the number of uninsured, untaxed or defective vehicles.\n\nMoney raised from speeding fines should be invested in policing our roads (and also further training of police officers) in order to reduce the number of vehicles that are not driven in accordance with the highway code and traffic legislation.\n\nMore needs to be done to safeguard road users, particularly vulnerable road users such as pedestrians, moped riders, motorcyclists and cyclists.",
