            "background": "A pilot scheme has begun in liverpool and it is causing massive upheavals and upsets for nurses and patients alike. it means that out-patients no longer receive continuity of care and now have different district nurses visiting them.This creates anxiety for the patient. it takes the nurse 10 mns to read through the patients notes, and they should not take longer than 15 mns per visit. they now have to travel much greater distances between patients, thereby wasting nurses time actually visiting the patient. district nurses working hours have been changed, forcing new shift patterns upon them, which include many being forced,  into an impossible situation to work the new shift patterns; in the main due to them being also mothers and carers.  This has resulted in 50% of district nurses in liverpool  off work through stress. this is costing the country dearly, all because massive changes have been made without any real thought of the consequences and implications of the  changes within the primary care trusts.",
