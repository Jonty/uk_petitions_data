(Sustainable areas policy)\nFailure to protect the welfare of servicemen/women in combat. (Lack of equipment)\nFailure to recognise illness derived from active service. \nFailure to limit immigration. \n\nDo you agree that the above list is a good reason NOT to vote Labour again.\n \nThis list is not exhaustive and no doubt you can think of many more.\n\nOn a personal note, all my family has voted Labour for over 100 years but I am now looking for an alternative and will encourage others to follow.",
