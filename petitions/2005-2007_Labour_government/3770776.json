            "background": "Many programmes are shown on television without subtitles, this makes it difficult for deaf/hard of hearing people to follow the programme and is grossly unfair when they have to pay a licence fee the same as others who are able to access any programm that they wish.  All transmissions should have subtitles which follow the exact same format as the programme without being too slow fast or disappearing half way through.  This is fair and just for all those with hearing problems.",
