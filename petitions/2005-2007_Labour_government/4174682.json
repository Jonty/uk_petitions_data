        "background": "The introduction of this bill would mean an end to sports such as speedway. Speedway is a community sport that the entire family can feel comfortable watching. There is no hooliganism,no corruption and is cheap enough for people of all social standings to be able to afford to go. Should we really be losing a sport like this?  To combat the menace of mini motos all we have to do is set up tracks, banning all off road   vehicles is over the top.",
