            "background": "Design Technology is a vital life skill, safe use of woodworking machinery and tools would firstly keep may young DIY enthusiasts out of Accident and Emergency. The use of CNC, Electronics, Robotics, Control System, Laser Cutters, rapid prototyping machines, are part of the model D&T department however these machines are not cheap and most schools are financially motivated to drop Design Technology. If we are to have a future populuos that has engineering skills, we must introduce the subject early, even the greatest scientist at some stage needs an engineering ability if it is only to build his test rig. We can't all work in offices, without production there is no export without export we become a third world nation in debt to the rest of the world.",
