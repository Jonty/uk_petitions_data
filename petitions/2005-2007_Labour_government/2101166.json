        "background": "The price of cancer drugs escalates almost daily, and patients desperate to prolong their live, (or even be cured) petition NICE to obtain access to one of the new effective treatments. Research at the Uni. of Alberta shows that DCA (DiChloroAcetate) offers promise of effectiveness at low cost. However, as the drug, which is used for rare metabolic disorders, is out of patent, there is little likelihood of any pharmaceutical company taking up this challenge as there will be little profit forthcoming. Could a government organisation sponsor the necessary research?",
