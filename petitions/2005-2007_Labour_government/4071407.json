            "background": "The government are planning to spend \u00a39.3 billion on the 2012 olympics, having just spent \u00a3800 million on the most expensive stadium in the world.  \n\nDoes our country not have other things that urgently need our attention - health, education, poverty to name but 3 worthy causes. \n\n'National identity' and 'urban regeneration' are good sound bites, but can we honestly say that this is the best use of this money?\n\nWe have to accept that an estimate of \u00a39.3 billion will become \u00a310, maybe \u00a312 billion over the next 5 years.  With Wembley as the legacy, and budget holders who forget to factor in VAT, I think we should be able to call a halt on this now.",
