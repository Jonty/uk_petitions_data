            "background": "Please strengthen the Navy by doing the following:\n1) Requring the companies who own nuclear power plants to deliver the plutonium from nuclear reactors to the military for the purpose of nuclear weapons production. At present, according to the BBC, there is enough plutonium in this country to produce 12,500 500 kT nuclear warheads.\n2) Asking Westland to develop a new ASW helicopter version, which should replace all ASW helicopter types currently used and be named Lion, after the animal our national emblem depicts.\n3) Ordering as many surface ships as the RN thinks it needs.\n4) Reversing your RN manpower cuts.\n5) Ordering the development of a new maritime military plane version based on the BAE 146.\n\nWhilst we, the undersigned, realise this military buildup will cost, we ask that the Prime Minister terminates needless bureaucratic government departments such as the Department of Culture and the Department of Communities and devotes the money currently spent on them for the military.",
