It is not unusual to hear of criminals who have 10, 20 and even 30+ previous convictions, however these people are still left to walk the streets continuing thier criminal activities.\n\nWe need to be protected from these people and it is the governments duty to enact legislation to prevent to constant abuses these criminals inflict upon the public.\n\nAny criminal who has previously received 2 custodial sentences should be liable for a minimum term of 25 years upon a 3rd conviction before even being considered for parole.\n\nWe can no longer afford to keep being soft on crime and have to make sure there is a real deterant for these people.",
