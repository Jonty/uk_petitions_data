It was a \"wealth tax\".  if you look at the value of your home, add to that your savings, insurance policy values etc you will be surprised at how much that can add up to.  Remember you have already paid tax on your earnings.  The thought of the government snatching back what I have worked hard for all my life is appalling.  I am an average homeowner, but fall inside this trap.",
