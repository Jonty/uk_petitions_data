He is 1 of only 12 living recipients of this country's highest award for valour.  However, the British Government has refused 84 year-old Mr Pun VC's application to settle in the UK, to seek urgently needed medical treatment, on the grounds that Mr Pun VC  \"failed to demonstrate strong ties with the UK\".\n\nWe demand that this heroic person be allowed to enter and remain in the UK to obtain treatment and to live for the remainder of his life if he so desires. \n\nMr Pun has certainly done a great deal for this country and shown such loyalty that few of its' citizens have done.",
