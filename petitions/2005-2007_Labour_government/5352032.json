        "background": "The government is placing considerable restraints on local authorities that mean considerable financial savings have to be made.\n\nTelford and Wrekin Council will have to make savings that could amount to more than \u00a310 million.\n\nThe governments proposals mean these savings cannot be re-invested to the benefit of the community.\n\nThis means front line services will suffer, the council will have greater difficulty in providing services and ultimately, residents in every community will suffer by way of more tax increases et.\n\nBy signing this petition, you sign to say that these savings of \u00a310 million, which could be more in larger authorities, should be used and re-invested to benefit each and every resident.",
