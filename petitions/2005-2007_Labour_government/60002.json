            "background": "The law in our country is to only be permitted to purchase r18s in licensed sex stores and not by mail order. There are many responsible companys out on the net who would only sell this material to an owner of a credit card where we have to be 18 or over to obtain credit anyway.People who would state clearly what is in the movie. why cant we sell this on line when we can go out and get it anyway. With the sex industry growing more and more there are far more couples and singles enjoying these movies. It is no longer taboo to admit to this. Obviously there are plenty more people who agree on this subject. please state your opinions readers.",
