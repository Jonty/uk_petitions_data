            "background": "Latest figures show we have some 11000 foreign prisoners in our jails. Not only does this mean the jails are full -  leading to some who deserve to be in jail not being sent!, but it takes a substantial amount of my taxes to look after them. I feel that, once convicted foreign prisoners should be returned to their home country to serve their sentence - this would also stop the possibility of them not being deported on release as has happened.",
