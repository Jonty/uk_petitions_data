        "background": "Congestion is made artificially high by the infliction of 'traffic calming' measures. The removal of bus lanes, chicanes, speed humps and pinch-points along with sensible timing of traffic lights would reduce congestion levels and allow the free flow of traffic throughout our road system and remove the need for congestion charging and road pricing as well as reducing exhaust emissions in congestion black-spots.",
