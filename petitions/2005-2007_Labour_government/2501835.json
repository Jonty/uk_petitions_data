        "action": "Reverse the policy of road narrowing, chicanes, unnecesary cycle lanes and unnecessary traffic lights that are ADDING TO congestion.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In the last decade or so, for the first time in history, the vital asset that is our road network, developed over a century, is being deliberately compromised. Measures such as hatching-off of road lanes, parts of roundabouts, chicanes (which are inherently dangerous), virtually unused cycle lanes on major roads are all ADDING to congestion and delays. So too the enormously costly practice of installing traffics lights in almost any place they'll fit.\n\nLet's see a policy of safe enhancement of traffic flows, reducing jams & queuing (which actually add to pollution). The intent should be to minimize obstructions and keep things moving. A reduction in journey times is surely to everyone's benefit.\n\nAuthority's have had their play at \"measures and initiatives\" under the guise of safety and clean air etc.: it hasn't worked. Let's be positive in outlook. Then, we'll have a genuine measure of the true extent of congestion, and what needs doing to remedy it.",
