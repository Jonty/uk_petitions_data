Here's some reasons why The Archer's theme tune should be made national anthem:\n\n-Everone knows it.\n\n-There are no words to learn\n\n-It would get everyone on their feet easily\n\n-It's about the most English thing about England\n\n-The Queen can sing it too, without having to sing \"God Save our Gracious Me\".\n\n-It can't be good to have the slowest National Anthem...well...ever.\n\nYou know it makes sense Tony!",
