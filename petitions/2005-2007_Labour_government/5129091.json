            "background": "Many privately-owned London flats and houses on the third floor or above now face having to pay thousands of pounds to install water pumps as the mains pressure is deliberately reduced. Combi-boilers do not work under 1-bar of pressure, which means no central heating and no hot water. Thames Water's so-called Network Improvement Programme means they are systematically lowering mains water pressure to reduce the number of leaks they have to mend.  The fewer the leaks, the less they have to spend repairing them, and the less they get scolded (or heaven forfend - fined) by the powerless water regulatory body. Oh, and higher profits, natch. Conveniently they do not have to legally supply water to individual properties - just to buildings. Thames Water are a foreign-owned monopoly and we have no choice as we can't switch provider - the least they can do is  provide us with water!",
