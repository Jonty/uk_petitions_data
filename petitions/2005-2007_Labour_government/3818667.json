        "action": "equalise the speed limits for all vehicles on two-lane single carriageways, preferably to 50 mph.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present single carriageway speed limits are 60 mph for cars, 50 for caravans and light goods vehicles, and 40 for HGVs. Many accidents are caused by car drivers attempting to overtake HGVs at unsuitable spots. Some car drivers are unaware that trucks travel more slowly because their legal speed limit is lower. If  all vehicles were limited to 50 mph this confusion would not arise, and accidents from this cause might be reduced.",
