            "background": "Margaret Owen has taught 1 year in Oldham in a secondary school and 41 years for Manchester Education Committee in Junior Schools.  Such dedicated service to the community must indeed be rare and an award such as that suggested should be a mark of the country's gratitude now that she has retired.  Margaret did not at any time put her name forward for a head-teacher's or a deputy head teacher's position because she wanted to teach and see the gleam of understanding in the children's eyes.  Her last Head at King David Junior School in North Manchester would, no doubt, agree that she was an outstanding teacher not only of children but of other teachers and students.",
