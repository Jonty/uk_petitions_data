            "background": "In the world today life is counting for\nless and the penalty for murder is literally a slap on the wrist.\nHow can we call ourselves civilised when a murderer is treated better than our innocent.\nI would like hanging re-introduced, with DNA testing available the likelihood of wrongful sentencing is reduced to almost zero.\nMurder has become away of life in some parts of Britain and if hanging was re-introduced people would think twice before committing this final act. The prisons have let out people in the past who have re-offended straight away and other families have suffered grief unnecessarily, hanging for murder would stop this.",
