            "background": "Mounting debts are being caused by the ease and availability of Credit Cards and their irresponsible use through the \"Want it now - just stick it on the plastic\" mentality that exists in Britain today. When people default on their payments their payments then ultimately the bill falls on the floor of responsible people like you and me through higher bank charges and interest rates - Especially with the ease of IVAs and Bankruptcies. \n\nThe word \"Credit Card\" has positive connotations to it - almost implying there is some sort of reward for its use, thereby encorouging vulnerable and irresponsible people to use it without thought to the consequences.\n\nTo this end I propose that the Term \"Credit Card\" to be outlawed and replaced with the term \"Debt Card\" as ultimately this is what you are taking on when you use one.",
