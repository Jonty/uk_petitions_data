Vehicles built after this date are fast disapearing, taking with them an important piece of British history.\nThe final days of British Leyland, the Austin Allegro, Morris Marina and Triumph Dolomite. The final run of the every popular Ford Cortina.\nThis era marked the final phase of British design for a lot of motor manufacturers, help us remember these iconic designs.",
