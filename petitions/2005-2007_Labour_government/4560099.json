            "background": "This petition is to bring into law a scale of engine power that new drivers are allowed to drive, as a proven way to reduce accidents and deaths, especially amongst young drivers. Learner drivers should be restricted to 850cc engined cars, 0<1 year post qualification restricted to 1000cc, >1-<3 1400 cc, >3 <5yrs <2000cc. This would slow drivers down during the time that they are learning driving skills and road manners, giving them greater chance of correcting poor judgement before an accident happens.",
