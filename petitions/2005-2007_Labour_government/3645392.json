            "background": "In order to make environmental housing possible, a new act would be required that covered many aspects of housing and green technology.\nThe act would require all energy production technology, insulation, and energy use reduction technology to be VAT zero rated and incentives be available to encourage uptake, e.g. grants for installation of solar tiles, ground heat exchangers or wind turbines, or a reduction in local taxes if greener technology is installed. \nThe act could also allow for the provision of a Government shop, that allows for the sale of the above items at cost price.\nStamp duty rebates could be available against all monies spent in improving the carbon footprint of both older and new homes.\nThe DTI should have the duty to encourage and support the development of greener technologies.\nLarge housing schemes should be required to provide local facilities to prevent many journeys, and efficient  public transport for when journeys are necessary.",
