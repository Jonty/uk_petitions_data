            "background": "The recent doubling of the Air Passenger Duty is extortionate and will only swell the Government coffers. Global warming is a myth and customers of airlines who use British airports are being penalised in the name of environmentalism. The tax is another way of saying \"don't do business with Britain - we're expensive.\" We suggest the APD is replaced with a fee that covers the Government's costs towards Civil Aviation - and no more.",
