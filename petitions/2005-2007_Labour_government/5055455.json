            "background": "It is unbelievable that motorist will have to pay to use the new thames gateway bridge. A new crossing in this area is long overdue and and as traffic increases the bridge will be needed to reduce congestion. If a toll is introduced surely the bridge would not realise its full potential. Also i believe that motorists confidence in toll bridges has been lost after the promise to cease the QE2 bridge toll was broken.",
