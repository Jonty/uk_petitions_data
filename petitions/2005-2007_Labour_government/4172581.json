If a person takes away someones life, surely the rest of their life should be spent behind bars. The pain and suffering to family members and friends must be horrendous and to give murderers reduced sentences just because we may overcrowd our jails is surely adding to their agony. Mr Blair, I urge you to look at sentencing in Britian. With rising gun crime and stabbings surely you must do something! Do not make a mockery of victims of murder!",
