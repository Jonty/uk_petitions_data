            "background": "The replacement/renewal of UK's nuclear deterrent will be a misallocation of defence funding.  There is no feasible scenario in which UK would use nuclear weapons independently of the US, but non-nuclear forces, notably personnel, are all too often shown to be ill-equipped and over-stretched. Neither is possession of nuclear weapons a ticket to the top table as Pakistan, India, Israel, N Korea and possibly Iran demonstrate.  UK would be more influential in the world if it set an example by leading the way out of nuclear weaponry.",
