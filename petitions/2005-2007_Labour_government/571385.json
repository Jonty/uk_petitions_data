            "background": "I would like to implore the PM to consider introducing a two term rule to prevent the stagnation of the position.  No person can maintain the role much beyond 8 years without losing credibility.  Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair have both suffered from declining popularity after so long in power thus adversely affecting their party and the country.  The leader cannot judge when is best to go.  Power does this to a person so stop it happening to future PMs.",
