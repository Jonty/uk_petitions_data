The concept of an ID card is not inherently unacceptable - credit cards are ID cards - but there must be a direct benefit to the holder.  Instead, oday's technology should be applied to produce an ID card the primary purpose of which is to enable the holder to vote in a secure manner. More referenda could be held, especially  in the area of Constitutional change (Europe, Scotland, House of Lords, Party Funding) all of which seems currently to be driven by the interest of the party in power at the time",
