            "background": "This stretch of road is not unsafe as has been claimed.  Many of the accidents that occur on this road are due to people driving considerably over the speed limit, usually under the influence of drugs or alcohol.  Reducing the speed limit on this road would not have any effect on the number of accidents, but would simply aggravate drivers who have to travel down this road every day for business.  There is no need to reduce the limit on this road, therefore we urge people to ignore calls to lower the speed limit on this perfectly safe stretch of road.",
