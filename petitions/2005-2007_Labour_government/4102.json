        "background": "Current recycling policies put the emphasis on individuals to recycle waste, yet a vast majority of waste is packaging that is designed for the convenience of retailers and their suppliers, and to show off a product. The government could reduce the amount of waste, by compelling or encouraging retailers and their suppliers to reduce unecessary packaging rather than place the burden and cost on consumers who often have little choice over what they buy",
