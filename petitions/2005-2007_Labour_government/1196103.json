            "background": "Today there are hundreds and even thousands of young people whom have a uncertain status regard the fact that they have been in this country since 1999 and in some cases even before this time. I am an asylum seeker and I have been in this country sinnce 1999. Regard that fact that I came here in 1999 I have had to re aplly for my status over three times. I work here and I pay tax just as every citizen in this country does. A few years a go the Home Office granted amnesty to all families that had come here in 1999 or before 1999 and had a child with them. Why didnt the Home Office inculde unaccompanied asylum seekers as well. So I urge everyone out there to sign this petition. So that the Home Office grants Permenant Status to all Unaccompanied asylum seekers that had arrived here in 1999 or before this date.So they can plan their future rather then being unable to make a plan for their future fearing that the next day they will be send back or as soon as they reach 18 years of age.",
