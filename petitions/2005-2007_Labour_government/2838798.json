        "background": "I live in Cheltenham and I gave up driving about 18 months ago, due to the ridiculous fuel prices, environmental concerns, road congestion and fumes and for the ease of just cycling everywhere or walking or taking the bus and so not having to worry about parking (or the lack of it) or getting my car vandalised or stolen.  The benefits to the population are huge--cut down on obesity, get children fit again, improve your health and well being and get out and get some fresh air.  Ok, so the weather is sometimes against you, but get some wet weather gear and brave it and you will find you could cycle 10 or 15 miles to work in an hour or so, probably the time it takes you to drive that in a city. There are already far too many cars on our roads, and we do not need more.  Just give up driving and get yourself fit and have a bicycle that doesn't cost you anything to go anywhere on.",
