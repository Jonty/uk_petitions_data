            "background": "A current Department for Transport publication \"Urban Safety Management Guidelines - Road Safety Strategies for Urban Communities\" urges local councils to make changes that lengthen journey times, that take road space away from cars with central refuges, hatching, bus lanes etc., and that give less time at traffic signals.  It even encourages road closures.  In short, it promotes congestion as a safety measure.  This is absurd.  By promoting the smooth flow of traffic and reducing journey times there would be fewer vehicles on the roads at any one time, less congestion, less stress, less rage -- and improved safety.",
