The policy of all manufacturers to make their machines totally dependent on electric water heating (the most expensive and most environmentally damaging method) is incompatible with the encouragement of alternative energy.\n\nThose people who have invested in solar hot water systems should be able to use their own hot water, not be obliged to use electricity.",
