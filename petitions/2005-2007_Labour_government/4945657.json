        "background": "Dear PM\n\nCongratulations on your 10 year tenure at 10 Downing street.\nThank you for your hard work as PM during a historic decade of achievements and conflicts including the Kosovo conflict, Diana car crash, NHS and schools reforms, The Milleniuem celebration, 9/11, Iraq & Afghanistan conflict, 7/7, Northern Ireland peace process and successful Olympic bid 2012. I never thought I'd live to see the day a British PM and Irish PM to be standing shaking hands together with Mr Martin McGuinness and Rev Ian Paisley at Stormont and speaking cordially.\nI also hope and pray that one day the Iraq conflict can finally be resolved by your successors.\nFinally, a tribute to your modernisation of the Labour Party to make it re-electable again and a remarkable premeiership under the most scrutinous \"pressure-cooker\" media age that any PM probably has ever had to face.\nUnlike many in this country, I have basic respect for yourself in the PM position, and firmly believe that all you have done over the last decade has been for the good of the country to the best of your ability as you saw fit at the time.\n\nBest wishes for the future and thanking you\n\nMik\n\nSoumik Das, Derby",
