        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We as skateboarders are told everyday to move on by either the public or official security personnel. I feel that we could benefit from having a place to skateboard that fulfils our needs as skateboarders. We need an environment that directly mimics a street environment; this would include rails, stair sets, ledges, small ramps etc.\n\nIn our area there is nowhere that can be legally skated on without being removed from there. We as people who wish to participate in sport feel that we deserve equal opportunities as members of the public who are trying to further our ability in skateboarding or any other extreme sport. Skateboarding is as much a sport as football or cricket. We participate in skateboarding as a leisure activity and to keep fit and if the government wishes to promote keeping healthy then I believe that this would be a good way to contribute to the ongoing campaign. We also feel that security to watch over a proposed skate park would be useful to deter vandalism.\n\nPlease consider this idea as a near future project in the Sale area.\n\nMany Thanks,\nThe Extreme sports community",
