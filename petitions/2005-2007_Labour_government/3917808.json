        "background": "Many Councils are now choosing to spray stone chippings stuck down with tar onto many roads. This is supposed to be a form of re-surfacing but anyone who has seen this will know it is a terrible alternative to tarmac. It leaves stones flying up and chipping cars for months after and then just comes unstuck and leaves the road worse than before. It is dangerous and annoying for all road users. It seems to becoming more common practice and the standerd of work is getting lower with many roads not even gettin the excess stones swept up when the job is finished. It should be banned!",
