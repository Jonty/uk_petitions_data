There is no doubt that Queen Elizabeth II has done an excellent job as Queen, so much so that she cannot possibly be matched by Charles or anyone else, who is too political.  The Queen is to be commended, respected and loved.\n\n2. The cost of the monarchy is at least \u00a335 million per year, not to mention the royal family's personal wealth and massive landholdings.\n\n3. On the demise of the Crown by The Queen, let the British People (that is, the People of Scotland, England, Wales and Northern Ireland) vote on whether to keep the monarchy or abolish it and establish a republic with a figurehead president like Ireland.",
