            "background": "Scottish independence would lead to more orders coming to business and industry in England and Wales as an increased number of orders would go to both countries. It could allow a reduction in business taxation whilst possibly even allowing a rise in government expenditure. An increase in the rate of taxation on spirits could also raise a degree of revenue. It would aid both heavy industry such as shipyards and hitech industry such as the aerospace industry.",
