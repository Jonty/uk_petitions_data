        "background": "For the past few years, government has adjusted the education system with new ideas until is has become the disorganised, poor-performing system we now have. What once worked for decades was changed with new subjects and old ones being ditched. Old subjects such as cookery were removed but not are being put back. If is isn't broken, please don't try to fix it. Give us this education system back again.",
