            "background": "I would like to draw to the attention of the Prime Minister pelican crossings. As they are at the moment, the sign to walk, (or not to) is a man. I think this is highly unfair. In a worst case scenario, coud it not be connsidered that females are not allowed to cross the roads? No where in the UK do you see a 'green woman' indicating you can cross a road. I recommend a simple Walk or don't Walk, replacement, similar to that in USA, so that discrimination may be avoided.",
