            "background": "The way Courts enforce current legislation on Bankruptcy can be unlawful and can violate section 6 of the HRA'98. No Judge is compelled to grant any petition for bankruptcy, but they appear to do this. They should establish the facts first and if the alleged creditor has not had a hearing over the alleged debt(s) it is wrong to allow any petition, so why do it? This is 'Bad Administration' and a violation of Article 6 of Human Rights. As is the use of Bailiffs to remove property etc. a violation of Article 1 of the First Protocol of the ECHR. Neither is it in the public interest to make people homeless, as it reportedly costs \u00a350,000 a year of taxpayer's money to house one homeless person. None of this makes any sense so the law should be completely abolished and replaced with better Human Rights based laws.",
