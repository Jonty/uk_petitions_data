            "background": "At this very moment, the fishing industries are competing with the likes of defenceless Penguins and Seals for fishing territories.\n\nThe numbers of such animals are continually dropping due to vast over fishing of what is their only food supply (mainly Krill and fish).  If this continues there will be no reminence of such creatures, except in Zoos.\n\nWe are the last generation that can help save these majestic creatures from extinction.\n\nSo, in summary, over-fishing in the Antarctic and Southern oceans must stop, and there should be tighter regulations to ensure that fishing levels are kept to a safe level, so wildlife such as the Penguins can regain their lost population numbers.",
