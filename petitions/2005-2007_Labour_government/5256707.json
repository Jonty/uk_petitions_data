It caters for all ages and varied tastes, with special events for children and young people, and is excellently run by the centre director John Tellet and his friendly and efficient staff. \n\nThere are proposals to fragment the services offered at the Tower by giving control of the building to the adjacent large secondary school and utilising a new city centre venue. This will put at risk the unique atmosphere of this listed former water tower which is highly valued by audiences and artists alike.",
