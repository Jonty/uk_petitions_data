            "background": "The Government are reluctant to give up speed traps due to the revenues they make. However, they need to stop criminalising people by issuing penalty points and clogging up the courts with minor speeding offences. A \u00a360 fine itself is sufficient to deter motorists. Dangerous drivers could still be dealt with by penalty points and the courts.\n\nMany individuals are now racking up multiple points on their licenses through the governments and local authorities indiscriminate and over zealous enforcement of speed. Such policies do not take into account whether the driver was driving safely or the environment at the time an alleged offence is committed. \n\nGreater control is need over the police to ensure that they stop taking advantage of the system by continuing to prosecute individual/s in the knowledge the conviction is unsafe due to incorrect procedure, calibration and use of equipment. Penalty points need to stop and should only be used in the most serious of cases.",
