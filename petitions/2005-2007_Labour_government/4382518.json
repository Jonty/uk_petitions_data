        "background": "This disease affects approximately 1 in 20,000 people. It is a severe neurological disorder and affects each individual sufferer in various degrees of severity but usually the same parts of the brain are affected. Because it is rare not many hospitals and/or doctors have even heard of it and this causes extreme distress for both the sufferer and his/her family.All hospitals and doctors surgeries should be made aware of this illness and have notes to refer to if or when the need arises. This would undoubtedly help the families who are suffering",
