            "background": "Con artists are now befriending, living with & marrying in order to steal meoney & destroy their victims lives. This should be treated as a very serious crime. \n\nThe con-artist should get a criminal record, should be named & shamed, should be made to pay back all they owe by working, but under police guard, which they should pay for too, this should not be paid by the tax payer. They should have their passport taken away, they should not be able to hold a bank account. It is imperative that all their rights are taken away, so they are unable to con anyone else once charged. \n\nIf the main con-artist is working with others to con, everyone involved should also be charged & get the same treatment as the main con-artist responsible. \n\nCompensation should be paid to the victim, so the victim can get their life back, eg some victims have lost homes, jobs etc due to con-artists.",
