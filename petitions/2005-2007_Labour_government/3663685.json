However the few mile stretch around Elvedon is still the thorn in the side of network.\n\nWe need to promote and reinforce the need for better transport links, for business, leisure and general sanity for those of us that travel the A11 daily.  Lets face it, the rail link is pretty poor at the moment and I'm sure I'm not alone in saying that I would be happy to pay \u00a31 a day for a vastly improved A11.",
