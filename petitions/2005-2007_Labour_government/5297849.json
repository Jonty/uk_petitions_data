            "background": "The majority of University graduates, graduating after 1999 are heavily in student debt. Also the quality of life for graduates can be dismal:\n\n- No Political party is doing anything to atract graduates. The emphasis seems to always be on families with children.\n- Many graduates end up  doing menial jobs or claiming benefits. Jobcentres are not equipped to deal with graduates, only unskilled people.\n\n- Many graduates cannot afford to buy a property thus end up renting and in undesirable areas. \n\n- Graduates pay taxes yet they are the least likely out of society to use services such as hospitals or have children!\n\nThis is very UNFAIR\n\nScrap the student loan interest and help graduates to get onto the property ladder.",
