            "background": "The Black Country towns of Wednesbury and Dudley have been deprived of a railway since the Beeching Report in the 1960's. With a population of over approx. 1 million people within a 10 mile radius both towns need a reliable heavy rail infrastructure with proven benefits. Since the decline of traditional industry, both towns still need commercial and manufacturing investment. A rail link which can also be used for frieght access can be a real catalyst for this. The original track is currently 'mothballed' so the purchase of land is not an expense in this case.",
