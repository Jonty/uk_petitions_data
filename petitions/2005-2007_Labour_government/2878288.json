This is disturbing and wrong.\n\nIn addition, the householder will be required to help them or face a fine of up to \u00a31,000 plus \u00a3200 for every day that they refuse to cooperate!  Compare this with the average fine for driving without insurance which is only \u00a3150.\n\nThis is unbelievable, and totally unacceptable.  Our homes are private.\n\nPlease create a law making it a criminal offence for a valuation officer to enter a person's home.",
