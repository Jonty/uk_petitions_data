        "background": "We, the public, are tired of not being heard. We're tired of not being able oppose to something but yet our views are not being heard. The only thing the extended congestion charge has done so far is make people late to their destinations!! It is obvious someone has not thought about accomodating the vast amount of people who will be switching to public transport! One of the reasons for the congestion charge is to improve public transport... I'm sure MILLIONS of us are still waiting to see evidence of this, as we battle to get on a bus every morning, or fed up with late, overcrowded trains. It is time for the congestion charge to go. It's an UNFAIR tax",
