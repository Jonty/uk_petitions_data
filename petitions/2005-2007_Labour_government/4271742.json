            "background": "Mr Blair has slipped off to Germany to join in a massive festival to commemorate 50 years of \"Common Market\".  It is also reported that at the same time he is likely to sign us up to a treaty which will in effect in June be a substitution for the Constitution which was rejected by France and would have been by England if we had a referendum then.  When we first joined the Common Market it was supposed to be for trade and business purposes only.  Now they propose to take over our lives completely.  Please Mr Blair listen to the people - we do not want to join the Constitution - we do not want the Euro - in fact like most people in Europe we regret joining in the first place.  Its alright for you - after all you will not be around to face the consequences will you?  Therefore - do the right thing for once and ask the people first - before you sign away our rights.",
