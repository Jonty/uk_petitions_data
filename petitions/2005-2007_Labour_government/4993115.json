            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Fears are growing that the 2012 Olympics may put ambitious plans for the Mary Rose in jeopardy, thus it needs to be ensured that vital Lottery funds are not redirected towards 2012 at the expense of this & other national treasures. The Mary Rose Trust is launching a renewed bid to secure \u00a320m from the Heritage Lottery Fund, but the costs of the Olympics are beginning to spiral. Currently the trust, which looks after the 16th Century warship based at Portsmouth, runs at an annual loss of \u00a3300k and requires an extra \u00a3500k every year to be able to complete the process of drying out and preserving the ships timbers, as well as hoping that a new museum could be built to exhibit the hull and the 1900 other artefacts that have been recovered. \"Mr Starkey (Renowned historian who's backed by Prince Charles) has said 'That there is even a question hanging over this is a national scandal. Olympics come and go. They are transient, but\nthe Mary Rose is unique.' - Taken from Portsmouths' The News.\"",
