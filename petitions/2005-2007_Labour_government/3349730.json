However the Chancellor introduced an unfair floor damping system, which has cost Suffolk \u00a37.3million in lost grant. This is money the County Council could have spent on its priorities, vulnerable children and adults. We are calling on the Prime Minister to use his influence to ensure that Suffolk gets its fair share of Government cash.",
