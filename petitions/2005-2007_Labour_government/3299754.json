            "background": "As only one in four humanities postgraduate students get funding from the AHRC, the ability to fund studies should form part of the eligibility. It is ridiculous that students who are offered places at Oxford and Cambridge for example \nmay not be able to take these up due to lack of finances. Yet, under the present system students from affluent backgrounds who could pay for these courses themselves are given access to funding. Ideally everybody should get maintenance but when it is limited, ability to pay must form part of the criteria. This should not dilute academic standards but it would help the selectors distinguish between excellent candidates.",
