        "action": "allow an exemption for lone drivers of a commercial vehicle to be allowed to smoke, or to allow currently restricted speed vehicles to run at 61mph in order to make up the time lost by drivers having to stop for smoke breaks",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Commercial vehicles which are manned by a Driver working alone do not qualify as enclosed work places shared with other people.  We request that an exemption against smoking in the workplace be allowed in these circumstances, as the alternative would be that HGV's and Vans would necessarily have to stop regularly so that the driver may safely leave the vehicle to have a smoke.  As HGVs are currently restricted to 56mph on the motorway, and every HGV has an increasingly tight delivery schedule, if required to forcibly stop, then the permitted running speed of these vehicles should be increased to 61mph, to allow lost time to be made back.",
