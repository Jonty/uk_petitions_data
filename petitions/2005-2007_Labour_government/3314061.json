        "background": "Building school for the future is currently in the consultation stage with a lot of money being put into education for the 21st century needs of our children. local councils have to bid to get money for schools to get built and the old ones demolished.Under the current proposals no on site accomodation can be provided using money earmarked for this very important rebuild agenda. surely it would be prudent and cost effective to have  school caretakers on site for security and emergencies at all hours of the day and night",
