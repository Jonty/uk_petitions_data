        "action": "Scrap tuition fees for university subjects that mean something",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I heard a rumour that the university tuition fees may soon be re-jigged whereby subjects that require special facilities, such as Chemistry, would be charged at a premium.  I think this idea is absolute nonsense!  Too many universities are offering pointless degree subjects such as Art and Sociology already, and a steady decline can be seen in the number of universities offering sciences and engineering qualifications.\n\nI therefore suggest that the government re-jig its ideas so that \"Mickey Mouse\" subjects are charged at a premium to discourage lazy youngsters from taking the easy option, and also so that extra money can be used to offset the cost of sciences and engineering courses to bring our nation's academic ability back up to where it should be.",
