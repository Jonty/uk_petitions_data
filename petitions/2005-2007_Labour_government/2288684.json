            "background": "The DTI ruled two years ago, that vets had a monopoly on the sale of pet medicines.\n Yet no one was told about it. As a result only 1% of pet owners with sick animals are buying elsewhere e,g,the net. \n What was the use in the MMC and the DTI doing all this work and telling nobdody about it.\nAnimals are suffering because the owners cannot afford the treatments. Ask the rspca they will tell you that cost chargedby vets is the biggest barrier to owners looking after the animals properly.",
