        "background": "At present, OFCOM require most television programs to abstain from encouraging persons to convert to religions, but allow television programs to encourage people to become atheists(e.g. Richard Dawkins' \"The Root of All Evil\").  In short, the rules concerning religious debate in the media are biased against all religions.\n\nWe request the prime minister to do all he can to equalise this - preferably by enabling religious people to try to persuade people to convert to their beliefs by rational argument in the media, but if that is not workable, by not enabling atheists to do the same.",
