            "background": "The brown hare is the only game species which does not have a shooting close season. This means hares are shot throughout their breeding season, resulting in thousands of orphaned leverets dying of starvation.\n\nThe brown hare's national population has declined by over 80% during the past century.  In the mid-1990s the Government's Biodiversity Steering Group identified a close season as an important conservation measure, but this has never been acted upon.\n\nOur campaign for a close season does not imply we approve of hare shooting at other times of the year.  We simply see a close season as a realistic objective and a minimum requirement for the welfare and conservation of hares.\nWe remain firmly opposed to shooting hares for \"sport\" at all times.\n\nRodney Hale\nChairman - British Brown Hare Preservation Society\nFor and on behalf of the members of the BBHPS",
