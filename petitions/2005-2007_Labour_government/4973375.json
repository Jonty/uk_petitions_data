ABOVE ALL, PUT THE GROWNUPS BACK IN CHARGE OF THE STREETS.\n\nWhat on earth has happened to our once proud civic centres?  Beautiful architecture and fine workmanship, (pre-dating and surviving the mad council abominations of the 1960s), accessible to all, are now dominated by Big Screens which repel anyone except, possibly, binge drinkers and out of control children. \n\nBirmingham's Big Screen has been passionately criticized by the Civic Society. It is an intrusive eye-sore, a noise polluter and degrades the historic civic centre. The screen makes our great public places into a kind of teenage-den  -slouchy-grungy-hang-out-bar.  Birmingham are even putting a beach around the screen this summer. \nSay no to profligate spending, say no to  cultural vandals, support your historic City and support Peace and Quiet!",
