            "background": "Public holidays are an important part of national life, many organisations have addition days e.g. Good Friday, Christmas Eve. Local authorities have additional days based around current public holidays. Spain currently has 16 days of public holiday in most regions. Holidays allow genuine rest for most workers without the worry of work piling up in the office. Self employed people often find it difficult to take holidays, additional public holiday would help with this.",
