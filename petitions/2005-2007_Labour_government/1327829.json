            "background": "DESO brokers UK arms sales to corrupt and brutal regimes, making a mockery of New Labour's promise to institute an ethical foreign policy. As the current investigations into BAE show, the arms industry has no compunction about selling to human rights abusing governments and often oils the wheels of its deals with kickbacks. DESO's involvement in this process involves us all whether we like it or not because it uses our taxes. The argument that this creates jobs is not valid. Government should and could be using our money to promote more ethical and useful forms of industry. It costs 16 times as much to create a job in the arms industry as it does to create one in the environmental industry.",
