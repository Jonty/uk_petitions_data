            "background": "This song is a modern aspirational tribute to hard work, life's rich journey, love and achievement, which could easily apply to the history and aspirations of a nation such as ours. It encourages us to respect our roots and reflects on the importance of 'keeping it real', i.e. remaining modestly realistic about the nature of fortune, whilst proud of the effects of hard work and commitment. It seems an appropriate modern day homage to our nation; urging us to be proud of our achievements  rather than vaingloriously naive, respecting where we have come from and the genuine struggle that that has entailed. I think this song 'speaks' to us a lot more than our current National Anthem. I do not intend any dis-respect to the Queen but I think a national anthem should be about all of us, where we have come from and where we are going to and our ideals in terms of getting there. I think a National Anthem should connect us all, in terms of pride, aspirations and values and I think this song could do just that.",
