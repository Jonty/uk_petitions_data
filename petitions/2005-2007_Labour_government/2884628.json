            "background": "As a married couple who chose to always have one parent at home for the benefit of the children, the main earner has to maximise earnings, this would be eased if the tax allowance for both of us could be utilised. At present a \"stay at home \"parent loses this valuable allowance and subsequently the 40% tax threshold penalises the family. In times when responsible parenting should be encouraged this policy actively discourages a traditional family.",
