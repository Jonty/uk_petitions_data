            "background": "NB. This is not like, or even similar to the  'studentrights' petition as that relates the human rights.\n\nCurrently Universities have self-governing authority in creating their own rules and regulations (with minimal\nstandards set by government.)\n\nThis is totally unjust and creates an atmosphere of corruption.\n\nThe Government states that students can go to the OIA (the Office of Independent Adjudicator for Higher Education) with their complaints however, the OIA is a privately owned\ncommercial company paid for solely by Universities that subscribe to them; the OIA are not monitored by the government or anyone.\n\nThe OIA do not conclude findings of student\u2019s complaints if they deem them to be of Academic Judgement; they can deem this even after a year of investigating a student\u2019s complaint - thus stoping the student from seeking Judicial Review.\n\nThe Government need to create Ofsted for higher education a soon as possible.\n\nWhy should the Government stop protecting students learning and\nthe learning environment after secondary school; especially when the students pay for the tuition at University.",
