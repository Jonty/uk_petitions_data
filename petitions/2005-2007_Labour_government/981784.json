            "background": "Why should we pay the BBC the enormous amount of money every year to fund their channels? Many of us subscribe to sky, cable etc.. and pay that amount on top of the regular TV license. BBC should fund their own channels through selling programs abroad and maybe even having adverts so that we aren't \"forced\" to pay if we have a TV.\n\nI hardly watch BBC and am frustrated at being forced to pay money to fund their programs when all the others channels fund themselves. I thought being in a democracy meant freedom of choice? What if I \"choose\" not to watch BBC, can I get a refund on my license?\n\nThis should be a subscription method like cable and sky use. You pay for what you WANT to watch rather than an enflated blanket payment for just 2 channels on regualr terrestrial television.",
