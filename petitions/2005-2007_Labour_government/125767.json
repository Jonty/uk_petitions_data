Infant mortality here is the highest in that continent; in 2004, 13 babies were stillborn in two months due to radiation in the water. Life expentancy is 48 for women and 52 for men. 50% of people over 40 have diabetes and cannot reach medical facilities for treatment. Up to 95% of the population are unemployed.\n\nIn the richest country in the world, people are living in third-world conditions.\n\nWe, as a nation, should show our disgust at this situation by refusing to ally ourselves with the US until suitable aid is provided for the true heirs of their 'great' nation.",
