Stop talking about locking all prisoners up and start pointing out that prison doesn't work, that prison has never worked. Stop talking about how many immigrants are being removed from the UK every month and start talking about the benefits to our economy from immigration. Use your position to take on the Daily Mail and their bigoted views.",
