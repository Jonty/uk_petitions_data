A Private Finance Initiative (PFI) for DTR in simplistic terms means that the winning consortia will effectively own all of the real estate and services for training for the next 25 years.  For this they will be paid an annual sum,and must, by law, make a profit for their shareholders. The contract is worth \u00a319 billion. A high profit margin will be made on the support services which go with it, these include catering, cleaning, transport, reprographics, administration etc. The large plots of real estate and buildings \u201csurplus to requirement\u201d will create additional profit. Thousands of civil servants will be directly affected by this massive sell off to the private sector",
