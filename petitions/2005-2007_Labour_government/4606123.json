            "background": "Tony Blair has given a lead in conflict resolution in Northern Ireland, has anticipated conflict ahead in Africa if poverty is not addressed, and has apologised for past wrong British actions such as the slave trade which still help to fester hostile relationships.  He is concerned re the Palestinian issue.  Why not, as part of his life-time legacy, set up a Blair Foundation for conflict resolution, which utilises principles already used by e.g. the Oslo Peace Accord peace-makers and the South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission?",
