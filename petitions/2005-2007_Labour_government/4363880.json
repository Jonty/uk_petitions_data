            "background": "We the undersigned hereby request that statistic related sickness procedures within companies for hospital related absence are abolished. Currently businesses especially large companies penalise staff who have had sickness after receiving hospital treatment, whether private or NHS by using statistics. This puts the staff in the same pidgeonhole as staff who take sickness for minor reasons like a cold or stomach upset. Currently staff who hit certain trigger points face disaplinary procedures for their absence or / and also have their pay review or bonus schemes affected resulting in the member of staff being penalised more than once. This also adds to more stress related problems within workforces.\nWe call upon the Prime Minister to abolish statistic related sickness procedures within companies where the member of staff has documentation to validate their sickness, hense would not face disaplinary procedure or be penalised on any pay review or bonus scheme.",
