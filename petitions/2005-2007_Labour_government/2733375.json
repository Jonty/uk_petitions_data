        "background": "I'm fed up with congestion caused by hordes of small economical cars.  You'll never get them off the road by bumping up the price of fuel, because they only use a quarter of the stuff I do, and that's if they drive properly, which they don't.  Usually, they tootle along at the speed limit, 6 inches in front of me!\n\nLocal councils have put in road humps that toss them around like corks, but nothing seems to deter people hell-bent on using fuel wisely.  I try to shift them with horn and headlights, but I'll crunch one before long.  Thank goodness my genetic gifts to mankind are cocooned in a bit of real metal.\n\nTake all the tax off fuel and have stiff charges for using the road when I want to.  The nation will benefit as the cheap skates will get to work an hour earlier and stay an hour later.  With luck I can move further into the country and still have an easier journey.\n\nAnd it's motorists, not the high earners, who'll give the military their Sat Nav system for cruise missiles etc.",
