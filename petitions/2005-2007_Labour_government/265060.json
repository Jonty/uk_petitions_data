            "background": "Government is proposing to introduce an NHS database that will hold potentially sensitive information that a patient would not want to be made available to anyone other than their own GP. It makes greater sense to have such information completely in the control of the patient therefore an NHS chip card that would hold the patients complete medical record protected in the same way as a bank or credit card by the patients own PIN number. Software and machines to read this information already exist and would give complete control to the patient over their records to be released or 'read' only with their compliance.Additionally, the burden to the tax payer would be substantially reduced.",
