            "background": "Basically, we believe that people these days are under a lot of pressure and stress, especially students.  Having a three day weekend would enable everybody to fully recuperate from a long and tiring week, with a proper chance to finish essays and do coursework WITH actual time to relax and socialise with friends, without having a hangover when trying to do work.  Children are the future!\nAlso, donate more money to charity.",
