The biggest culprit in these areas are car drivers. With over 1.8 million people signing a petition against road pricing, a simpler way of curtailing demand for road travel is the tried and tested price mechanism. The system is already in place to collect the revenue. There will be no expense of tracking devices which cost money, use precious resources, and generate CO2 in their production and use.",
