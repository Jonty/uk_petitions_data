        "background": "Many juvenile criminals are persistent and repeat offenders. Many of these miscreants are actively pursuing a life of crime, in the full knowledge that they will not be identified in news reports or in press coverage, and can therefore commit offences without being identified. This is plainly wrong. The community in which these people live, have an absolute right to know who these offenders are. It is very rare indeed that a juvenile appears before a  court for a first, or even second, offence. I submit that juveniles who have been CONVICTED of more than one offence, at court, should have their identity disclosed, both in an effort to make other members of the community aware, and also in the hope that the publicising of their identity may act as a deterrent to further offences being committed. The public also have rights.",
