Over the last 10 years, our laws have descended to a state where no-one knows what is right and wrong. The truth has become secondary to the spin, resulting in a breakdown in law and order.\nThe Prime Minister, voted by the People for the People, it is one of there primary jobs to ensure people and companies abide by the Law. \nThe more complicated they become with exceptions, Guidelines etc. the more it becomes perverted. The easier it is the argue English rather than what is Right and Wrong or the Truth. \nAs the country decends into Pottersville (See Its a Wonderful Life), it appears the current Prime Minister is happy with subjective words like reasonable force, which can be argued either way.",
