            "background": "We the undersigned, petition Her Majesty\u2019s Government (Ministry of Defence) to consider the historically important buildings at RAF Driffield (East Yorkshire), when choosing a buyer for this site, which is to be sold for redevelopment in 2007.\n\nWhen choosing a new owner, the MoD will also be responsible for deciding the fate of this historically important site.  This petition requests that the MoD take into consideration the probable fate of the buildings measured against each bid.  We the undersigned request that the MoD reject any bid which clearly illustrates the intention of the bidder to demolish most (if not all) of the buildings.\n\nWe the undersigned appreciate that the MoD is obliged to secure the best possible price for the site, though they are not obliged to accept the highest bid.  We the undersigned wish to see former RAF Driffield preserved through sympathetic redevelopment, which would benefit the local community and satisfy those who care about our heritage.",
