            "background": "It is our belief that the British Government should pay for items up to 2kg's in weight for delivery via BFPO to troops on operations in Iraq and Afghanistan. These young men and women put their life on the line daily in supposed duty for their country but their families have to pay post office charges to send out morale boosting parcels to their loved ones. This is a disgrace from this government and it should do the honourable things by paying such charges for troops in theatre.",
