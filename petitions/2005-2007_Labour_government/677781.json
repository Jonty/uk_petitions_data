        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is already public knowledge that stress in the workplace is on the increase and that more and more work days are being lost to stress related illnesses. Surely if the minimum holiday entitlement was raised to 25 days (after 1 years continuous service, to ensure some loyalty) this would dramatically reduce the number of days off sick and increase morale in the workplace, therefore saving the country some of the \u00a3billions each year that is lost to illness.",
