            "background": "In view of the damage caused by global warming and the inevitable end of road traffic once Peak Oil has hit, young people should (and eventually will) no longer have the option of learning to drive a car. No new driving licenses should therefore be issued. This should be compensated by huge development of modern transport systems - rail, tram and canal - and by subsidised fares for young people who otherwise would have used cars.",
