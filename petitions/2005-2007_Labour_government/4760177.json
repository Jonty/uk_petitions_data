            "background": "Iconic newsreader Moira Stuart has been a welcome face on British television screens for years, and with her polite manner and engaging persona has presented the news to generations of families. Her journalistic integrity and job focus is legend. \nTelevision news is a vital service provided by the BBC and yet despite the appeal of Moira's traditional brand of news journalism, the decision has been taken to remove her from her role in on-air presentation.\nOne can only speculate as to the real reasons behind this move, however the British public who pay the BBC's licence fees demand that it does not go down the same road as other broadcasters, who have gone in for a less credible, more entertainment based news service. Further, we demand the immediate reinstatement of Moira Stuart in her role as BBC Newsreader.",
