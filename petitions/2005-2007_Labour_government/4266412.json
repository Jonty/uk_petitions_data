The dwp should carry out their own surveilance on a person before stopping a persons benefit. NOT just act on a letter sent to them by a jealous and vindictive neighbour. The way that the dwp go about checking on these complaints is discusting, but because it is a Goverment Department they seem to be above the law. The whole system stinks and requires a massive shake up.",
