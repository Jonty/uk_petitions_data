        "background": "Homosexuality is commonplace and it is gaining acceptance across the world. Some countries already include homosexual sex as part of the Sex Education delivered in schools, the government, health professionals and various charities are ranting on about the increase of HIV and AIDS, schools in this country are still teaching about \"catching AIDS\". With these kinds of gaping holes in Sex Education being delivered to the impressionable people in our society no wonder HIV/AIDS are still on the increase. \n\nHomosexual sex, HIV/AIDS and the devastating effect it can have should be part of core Sexual Education. Sign this petition and give the children of Britain the education they deserve!",
