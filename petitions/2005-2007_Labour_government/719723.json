        "background": "Air Passenger Duty is due to rise on 1 Feb 2007. It has been announced that Gordon Brown wants it to be backdated and to affect those who have already booked their travel (and fly after 1 Feb 07).\n\nThis could mean upto an extra \u00a380 per person which is unacceptable. Some companies plan to absorb the costs but others are insisting that this is paid by the traveller (and if not paid then you cannot travel).",
