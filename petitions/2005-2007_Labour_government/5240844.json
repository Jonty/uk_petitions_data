        "background": "There is no moral justification for charging families \u00a31000s in tax to move house. There is no value added, they become no richer through being forced to move, normally through work. In fact they incur high moving costs already. A home is not an investment like shares are. It is an escape from homelessness and poverty. \n\nThis petition supports the tax of 2nd homes. These are investments. And two home owners limit the buying power of young 1st time buyer families. But the taxing of families who are forced to move house, in an ever more flexible labour market, amounts to nothing more than despotic bullying with no more justification than that 'you can'.\n\nEnd it now!",
