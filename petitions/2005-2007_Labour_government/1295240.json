            "background": "government are encouraging us to eat healthy to eat more FRESH FOOD and FRESH FRUIT so why are the elderly being neglected and over looked.In my borough Sandwell, the council have decided to give the elderly people of Sandwell  FROZEN PROCESSED MEALS. They have always had FRESH COOKED FOOD, cooked and prepared on the day and delivered by Meals on Wheels,and now they are going to have a fortnightly delivery of frozen meals in stead of the daily delivery and friendly face they have become a custom to.The job we do is more than just to deliver a meal each day, we are some times their only contact with the outside world,we find people who have taken a fall, or who have fallen ill,change a light bulb put the gas fire on,that will all be gone under this new regime.With frozen meals they have to cook the meal themselves and of course its added fuel costs plus the price of the meal. Show the government with a vote on this petition that we wont stand for this neglect of elderly people.",
