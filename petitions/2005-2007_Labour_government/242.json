            "background": "For too long now, the government has supported the growth of DAB, but the marketplace has not accepted it, and it is fast becoming the \"Betamax\" of radio with poor reception and expensive to purchase equipment.\n\nThe new and exciting alternative is ONLINE DIGITAL RADIO - free to access via wireless and one's own PC, a choice of almost every area of music, talk, sport and niche listening, and people can run their own radio station from home for less than \u00a350 a month.\n\nTo aid the growth on online radio, we need the government to promote the service to the public and make more help available to areas that have not yet currently got wireless Internet access available.\n\nHelp online radio grow.",
