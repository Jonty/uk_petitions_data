            "background": "Whilst everyone appreciates the need to cut carbon emissions raising additional revenue by increasing Airport Departure Tax will not reduce the amount of carbon emissions of an aircraft leaving the UK. People simply will not be put off travelling just because of tax increases. This petitions asks instead for the government to ask the airlines to reduce the baggage allowance of all passengers by 25%-35%. This will result in reduced aircraft weight and therefore less fuel burn during take off and a positive effect on reducing emissions.",
