            "background": "We should stop persecuting drivers caught speeding by small amounts such as 5mph if they are driving safely and not in built up areas. Many people now have points on their license for minor speeding convictions (such as 33 in a 30 limit), and not only are such convictions pointless, but they also serve to make people agree with the idea that the police are happier to prosecute motorists for minor crimes than fight 'Real' crime such as assault and burglary. We need to set a realistic figure that should be allowed (such as up to 15% over the speed limits, as many vehicles, especially older cars have inaccurate speedometers and this cannot be used as an indication of the users driving ability.",
