            "background": "In only 4 years Esprit gymnastics has developed a club with 600+ members, works with more than 30 local schools (900+ children), developed links with local disabled and special needs groups and increased sports participation in the town, far in excess of what the councils own expensive initiatives have achieved. It has also developed many county, regional, national and International medal winners including 3 members of team GB and to name but one, the under 10 British rhythmic gymnastic Champion. Yet it still refuses to help the club find a permanent home. in December 2008 Esprit's (expensive) commercial lease runs out on its 'warehouse' and the council STILL refuses to help the club find a permanent home. Sign up to help esprit keep the gymnastics alive in Swindon and help it continue to develop great British athletes. Every sport in the town has at least 'some' facilities - gymnastics has NONE, this is discrimination and must be stopped!",
