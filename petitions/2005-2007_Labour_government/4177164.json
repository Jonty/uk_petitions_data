            "background": "The current situation is that the Microsoft monopoly forces people to use MS Windows where there is no alternative to a particular package they need to use for their job ie Sage, Photoshop, Dreamweaver. This creates a distinct advantage for one company, Microsoft, to set uncompetitive pricing on it's operating system. Making this software available on the free community based operating system, Linux and on the Mac would take away this monopoly and give the consumer a better deal.",
