            "background": "It is true to say that one of the worst fashion crimes committed by most people in this country is in the choosing and displaying of undergarments. \n\nAround 58 million people have, at some point in the last 3 years, worn the incorrect combination of socks and boxers or lingerie. \n\nClearly, this has to be stopped. The outrageous claims that it \"doesn't matter\" what you wear on the outside is obviously incorrect, as can be gathered from expressions of contempt on people's faces across the country as they enter the bedroom to find their partner in a bright pink corset with a lime green thong attached to their being. At least she wasn't wearing socks. \n\nPlease end this despicable practice today.\n\nSign the petition.",
