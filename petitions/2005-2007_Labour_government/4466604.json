        "background": "The transport secretary categorically stated that the proposed congestion charge \u2018\nWas definitely not about the money\u2019. If this is the case, instead of beating the English public with the tax stick all the time, why not try the carrot approach instead? \n1)\tEvery single vehicle in the England to be fitted with a tracker \u2013 mandatory.\n2)\tEach vehicle monitored and noted whether it is outside the owners address and amount of time it is stationary.\n3)\tFor every hour that the vehicle remains at the home address, the owner is either\nusing alternative public transport or at home. If neither of these then he/she is either staying home  or obtaining a lift off someone. If this is the case then the other person would be tracked and charged for usage anyway. All the while the vehicle is stationary outside a location; that person is not contributing to Global warming. For this, the owner would receive a rebate on his or her tax bill. This could be approx \u00a31.00 an hour during peak times.\nAs you can imagine, everyone would much prefer getting a rebate on tax instead of having another tax imposed on them. If this meant leaving the car at home to achieve this rebate then millions would do so.",
