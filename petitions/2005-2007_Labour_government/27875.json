            "background": "The vast majority of parking and traffic problems near schools during the \"rush hour\" is due to parents (mainly in 4x4's) dropping off fat kids to school. On-road parking within a one mile radius of schools should be banned during the peak drop-off and pick-up times for schools. Non-residents violating this prohibition should have their vehicles crushed.",
