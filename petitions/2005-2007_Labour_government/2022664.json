        "background": "The Court of Appeal reversed a precedent of compensation for pleural plaques. They found that pleural plaque is not a compensable condition. This condition is caused by asbestos. Using asbestos and the law on its disposal is clear. If you breach these rules you will be prosecuted fined and may be imprisoned. Insurance companies have convinced judges that this illness is not a compensable condition.  This is about money and not the person who worked in the vicinity of asbestos where employers exploited their workforce when using this material, knowing that it is dangerous and can be deadly. If you are injured through no fault of your own, you are entitled to compensation. It is a medical fact that pleural plaques is an illness and the main cause is asbestos. When does insurances companies, employers, judges become experts on medical matters. By signing this petition, you will be helping 10,000+ who are currently diagnosed with this condition.",
