            "background": "We are told that speed kills; I believe that stupidity, poor driving and/or alcohol kill. So why does the government believe that reducing the current 30 mph speed limit to 20 mph (33.33% decrease!) will drastically reduce road traffic accidents? The answer is, it doesn't. The government is speculating, in order to satisfy anti-motorist campaigns and raise yet more revenue at the motorists\u2019 expense. By signing this petition you will be showing the government that the \"war against motorists\" is unacceptable and that 20 mph is a dangerously frustrating speed.",
