            "background": "Currently public transport is not competitive with road travel.  In many places it is still cheaper to drive and pay for parking, then to pay for a train or bus ticket.  Not to mention the convenience.  If the government wants to really tackle our congested roads they must look into making it affordable and possible to make the equivalent journey by bus and train.  Now it simply can't be done, and if atempted is done under someones hideous sweaty armpit as its too crowded or takes two to three times as long.",
