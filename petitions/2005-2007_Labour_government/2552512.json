            "background": "Prisons are full often with people who should not be in prison full time. We need to look at alternatives to full time prisons. We would like to see the introduction of Weekend and bank holiday prison for thos in employment and in full time education. \nIf a person has committed an offence and it is proven he/she are in full time employment it would be better for the country if they only attended prison in their time off i.e weekends and Bank holidays. This would keep those in employment still in the work force and earning money to look after their families and also to pay taxes. These in education would be monitored to ensure they were not abusing the system and if they were they would then be sent to a main prison.",
