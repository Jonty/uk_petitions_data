            "background": "As a Paramedic I have been to more than my fair share of people who have abused the 999 system by calling for an ambulance.  I would like nothing better than to force these time wasters to pay a fine for this abuse.  My concern is that people who genuinely needed an ambulance might then hesitate to call an ambulance for fear that they might be charged.  A group particularly vulnerable would be the elderly.  I have been to far too many people who have died prior to my arrival because they didn't want to be a nuisance.  Initiating charges would mean that I went to more, which is not acceptable. Please educate the time wasters, but do nothing to stop people who need our help calling us.",
