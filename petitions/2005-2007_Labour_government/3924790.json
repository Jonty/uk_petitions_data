Currency, Decimalisation, Measurements etc. Nothing in these changes benefited our country; we were working quite well in those departments.\nLooking at the news, they are even trying to take the little crown symbol off of our pint glasses! Why? because they can. No other reason.\nThey are also trying to make it illegal for manufacturers to print imperial measurements on their packaging.\nAll this meddling is needless and our government must be strong enough to put the EU in its place.\nDraw a line Mr. Prime Minister and don't allow them to cross it.",
