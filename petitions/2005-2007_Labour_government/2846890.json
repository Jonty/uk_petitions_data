        "background": "The position of Mayor Of London has been created at much cost and the motorist seems to be paying the price!\nThere is no choice of electing a new candidate so I suggest we scrap this position and either replace with regularly elected candidates or indeed save the cost of the mayor, offices and staff and use towards the road costs instead. How many congestion charges does it take to cover his wages alone.\nN.B.This is not a vendetta against Ken Livingstone as a person. But even the government are elected every 4 years.... and there was no referendum as to whether the people actually wanted a Mayor Of London in the first place.",
