        "background": "Why should they be exempt?  They became members of that family simply by accident of birth; they could just as easily have been born into the poorest family in the country.  Some of them work very hard?  So do many on the minimum wage and they have no choice about paying tax; on a yearly income probably not much less - if at all - than the weekly income of even the most minor royal.  This petition was inspired by seeing news reports that Prince Charles had had a RISE of \u00a31 million; how long would most tax-paying workers have to work to earn this?",
