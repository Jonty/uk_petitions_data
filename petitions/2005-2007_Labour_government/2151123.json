            "background": "The government must not be tempted limply to give in to noisy lobbies and needs to continue to explore all possible ways to ensure that Britain's transport network works - so that goods and people can be transported safely and in ways that have least negative impact on our economy, the environment & our quality of life. If this means deterring excessive, selfish or ill-timed use of roads, it can benefit all road users. If it creates a pool of additional funds for other transport options, let's have a proper public debate about priorities. And, before the debate gets bogged down in issues of privacy & freedom, let us, separately, review all possible ways to implement de-congestion policy.",
