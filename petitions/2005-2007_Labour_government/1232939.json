It is our view that we must turn off a considerable amount of lighting in unpopulated areas and make major reductions to the levels in populated areas, after, say, 23.00 hours.  Every situation, every lamp should be assessed on a real needs basis in consultation with residents, user groups etc. Public safety must remain a priority for a realistic/popular outcome.",
