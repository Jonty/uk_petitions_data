            "background": "currently the law only allows learners to take a motor cycle test on a 125cc machine capable of 64 mph AND less than 125cc AND under 25Kwph to ride anything larger.There is only one current model capable of these stipulations (The LML 125 star DLX.) This forces most scooterists to take a test on a motorcycle to be able to ride a 150cc or higher scooter, which are usually slower than a 125cc Motorcycle.These machines do not handle like a bike and the test should reflect this. Please change the law to allow scooterists to take a test on a scooter by having the limitation for the test as Under 25KWph. Thereby allowing scooterists to take a test on a 150\\175cc machine which is less powerful and slower than some 125cc bikes which can be ridden by learners. The law as it stands discriminates against scooterists and does'nt make for safer riding.",
