            "background": "The road taxing is unfair to induviduals such as myself who come within the Governments designated lower income family bracket, and travelling to see family who live in other parts of the country, or to even take my children out for the day would become impossible as road tax and fuel is so expensive already, so to have to pay to use roads that enable me to do this would be abserd and cruel to those of us who already battle and struggle to make ends meet as it is.",
