            "background": "In other countries, lorries and trucks are not permitted to drive on the main arterial roads during rush hour and main daylight hours Monday to Friday.  Instead they drive at night and out of the generally busy periods, thereby enabling people to travel to and from work and conduct business more expeditiously with smaller vehicles (cars & buses).  This would be most beneficial here in the UK.  The Government should also put more resources into the railways to enable more goods and freight to be transported to hubs, which will then be distributed locally by trucks and vehicles, thereby reducing the necessity for so many large trucks to be on the roads.",
