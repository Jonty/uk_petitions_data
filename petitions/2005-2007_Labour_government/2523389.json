            "action": "replace all existing taxes on the motorist, including road tax and fuel duty, with an equitable road charging system. Such a new tax must not be used as an additional revenue collection device and existing taxes on the motorist must be abolished.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current taxes on the motorist do little to address green issues and road congestion. They should all be abolished and replaced by a well thought out road charging system which should be revenue neutral and aim to reduce emissions and congestion by penalising large high consumption motor cars and reducing road usage. At the same time investment in public transport infrastructure should be increased to deliver real long term improvements.",
