        "background": "In the dead of night, there are thousands of bus shelters with glowing signs, huge illuminated hoardings proclaiming special offers and other illuminated signage. All buy electricity at a cheap rate... Start charging consumers of electricity, such as this, who are profligately wasting energy at a much higher rate, suggested 50p per unit. This would dis-incentivise wasting of energy and these funds could be used to pay a guaranteed price for renewables to subsidise their adoption.",
