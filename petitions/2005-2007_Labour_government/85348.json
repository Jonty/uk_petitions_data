            "background": "The UK has punched well above it's weight throughout recent history, thanks to being small enough to react, but big enough to have real influence in the world.\n\nThe geography of being a small set of Islands, has naturally made the nation the ideal size for democracy to work. This is why Britain is the home of democracy.\n\nHowever, the same politicians trying to destroy our democracy for some strange notion of European Union, have poisoned the UK by creating unbalance in its constitution. Intentially, Scotland and Wales were given a few powers, to con their people into thinking they have home rule, when in fact they are just EU enclaves as before.\nDon't fall for it people of Britain. Undo the damage to politicians did in the first place and demand REAL democracy for the people, but retaining the United Kingdom, but with real power being pushed down to the people, not fake EU regionalisation instead!",
