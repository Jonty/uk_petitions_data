            "background": "It seems the Government need to get a grip of the mess in which it finds itself in.  They have taken away the parents, teacher\u2019s powers to discipline children since they came to power.  Now we\u2019re afraid for our own children, at school out with their friends etc..  I say that any one, young or old gets caught carry a replica or real gun 10 yrs.  You fatally shot someone. 30yrs minimum.  Or they have a choice; one for carrying 10yrs or 5yrs in China, Russian prison; this will be the same for fatality\u2019s 30yrs here or 20yrs in China or Russia etc.  The Government would pay them for taking our prisoners.  Just imagine it, the amount of money we spend for housing a prisoner is ridiculous, pay the Chinese & Russian etc. governments.  Forget their human rights; were they thinking of their victims human rights?  I think not.",
