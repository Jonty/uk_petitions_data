            "background": "Self builders generally create more energy efficient homes, they build using much higher levels of insulation and more use of green energy (solar panels, wind turbines). It is currently near impossible to find a plot of land which will be granted planning permission as the government insists on the use of brownfield sites, these brownfield sites are generally too big and expensive for the self builder and are often snapped up by developers who don't put the same considerations into building well insulated energy efficient homes.\nThe government should make it easier for the self builder to obtain planning permission for building thier own environmentally friendly home, they should even consider allocating land for such purposes with measures in place to ensure these are not simply swallowed by developers out to make a fast buck.",
