            "background": "There are 5 large coal mines remaining in the UK. We import more coal than we produce. Very soon we will be reliant on countries such as Russia, Columbia, China etc for our energy supplies. We leave ourselves open to the same chaos seen in the 70's with oil prices. We need to act now before we are too late.",
