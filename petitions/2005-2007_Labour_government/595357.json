WHY???\n\nWe feel that the DVLA has no business assisting a private company to issue a fine. \n\n2. There is no law on this matter \u2013 WHY??\n\nThe law should protect the public ensuring companies are:\n\na) licenced\nb) Accountable\n\nThere should be tarrifs for the fines and above all a recipient should have recourse to the courts.\n\nUnless the government steps in and takes ownership of the problem its simply going to cost the government millions of pounds in court cases .\n\nMr. Blair - it's time to act!",
