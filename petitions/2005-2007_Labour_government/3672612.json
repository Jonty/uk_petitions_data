A binding treaty that embodies \"basic laws\" for 490 million people in 27 countries based on a despised constitution, rejected by voters across Europe. Nine countries with over 150 million people turned it down or, decided not to put it to the vote. Blair alone has decided the UK will not vote. If you don\u2019t want to be controlled by a European Federation, we must demand a national referendum NOW. \nIt will create:\n\u2022 A PERMANENT, unelected, EU president. A sole voice for Europe serving a 5 year term. \n\u2022 FULL-TIME foreign and defence ministers for Europe meaning powers like China and America will by-pass Britain to speak directly to them. \n\u2022 A REFORMED European parliament drawing up its own laws. Britain couldn\u2019t veto its decisions and each member states government loses the right to \"opt out\" of EU laws & treaties.\n\nACT NOW or be slaves to the EU forever",
