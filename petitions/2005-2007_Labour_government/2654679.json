Consider the founding of centres of excellence \u2013 health centres/surgeries which have CAM practitioners on-site \u2013 and promote the routine referral of patients to local, CAM practitioners for the treatment of chronic conditions. Integrated Health also means emphasising preventative medicine and self care, looking at the person as a \u2018whole\u2019- treating the underlying causes and address the effect lifestyle, environment and emotional wellbeing have on health.",
