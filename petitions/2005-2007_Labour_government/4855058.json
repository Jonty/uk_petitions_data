            "background": "I believe that, in much the same way that extortionate bank charges are unlawful, parking fines are administered and upheld with a zero-tolerance approach, often fuelled by commission driven attendants, and are in most cases simply a means in which local authorities can make \"easy money\".\n\nAs we all know, the vast majority of vehicles which are parked for longer than the allocated time are produced with a parking ticket within only a couple of minutes.\n\nI suggest as means of a \"gesture of good faith\" or \"benefit of the doubt\" action by local authorities, to allow the offender to buy a ticket which he or she must produce to a local authority office which would cover the parking for the period of which the offender had not originally purchased a ticket for.",
