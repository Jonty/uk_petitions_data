            "background": "A petition to ban China fur imports got 500+ signatures & this reply:\n\"national import bans would be less effective than working around the world to agree animal welfare standards & phase out cruel & inhumane farming & trapping practices\".\n\nUK government obviously has no power \"work around the world\" in China, nor force an EU ban (which has a separate petition, but was muddled-in with this reply). Such power is 0% effective.\n\nBanning China to UK fur import is 100% effective in reducing suffering in the case of each animal saved.\n\nThe Government should reconsider its belief, compare 100% with 0% and decide which is  greater.\n\nRecap:\n\"Millions of animals are killed every year in China and the fur trade is growing. The British fashion industry turns over more than \u00a3500m a year in animal fur, including cat & dog fur imported from China. These animals are kept in appalling conditions & treated abhorrently (including several reports of animals being skinned whilst still alive).\"",
