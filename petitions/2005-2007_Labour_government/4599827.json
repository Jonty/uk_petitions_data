            "background": "We repeatedly hear MPs respond to direct questions with obfuscation and misdirection. \n\nThe widely signed petition against road-taxing was dismissed as being based on myths and misunderstanding - yet no-one attempted to tell us specifically what these myths were or to correct these misunderstandings.\n\nRecently government statistics stating that 30% of people would object to ID Cards were first witheld as long as possible and then dismissed as outdated by the government. No attempt was made to explain how the government knew they were outdated or as to whether the 30% figure had increased or decreased. \n\nStatistics that support government policies, however misleading, are happily used by the government without supporting evidence. Those that disagree with the government's stance are simply dismissed out of hand without consideration. It seems that 'evidence-based policy making' is more often 'policy-based evidence making'.\n\n\"He uses statistics as a drunken man uses lampposts - for support rather than for illumination.\" ~Andrew Lang",
