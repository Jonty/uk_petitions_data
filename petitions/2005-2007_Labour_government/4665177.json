        "action": "ensure legislation is in place to prohibit a backlash re-introduction of bank charges for ALL bank account holders as a result of the high street banks having to refund large amounts of illegally levied bank charges.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The High Street banks are not going to sit back and accept the loss of the large sums they are having to refund to overcharged bank account holders who have not managed their accounts properly.  Those many millions of account holders who do manage their accounts properly are now very likely to be penalised.  The government should take action to ensure that (just like in our currently punitive national income and other tax system) the majority do not end up paying for the failures of the minority who have no incentive to change.",
