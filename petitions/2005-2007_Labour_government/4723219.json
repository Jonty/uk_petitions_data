            "background": "It is unfair that LPG 4x4 users are penalised when their vehicle is actually more green and produces less emissions than a standard vehicle.  A lot of 4x4 users have taken the time to convert their vehicle from petrol or diesel to LPG, which costs them around \u00a32000.  Therefore they should not be penalised when the road tax is increasing due to 4x4 large emissions when these vehicles actually produce less emissions than the standard vehicle.",
