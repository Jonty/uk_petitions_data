Just think, riding on a motorway at 70mph and then for whatever reason you find yourself sliding along the road towards the central reservation, only to find yourself hitting the 'unprotected' posts. Ouch!! Limbs have been ripped off of our fellow bikers due to this type of accident. Please, place a rubber bumber under all existing armcoe barriers to stop this from happening again. While you'r at it, loose the wire barriers.",
