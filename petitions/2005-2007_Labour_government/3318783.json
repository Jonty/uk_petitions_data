Myself and my husband have worked hard all our life putting taxes into this country. I worked and worked to get my nice little home in the country with its conservatory and fields. I've not claimed child support, or any benefit apart from a couple of weeks job seekers allowance. Why the hell should I pay for all the foreigners that just come over here and get council tax allowances, NHS and all other benefits. Look after your people Mr Blair we have worked hard for this country.",
