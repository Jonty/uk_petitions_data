            "background": "Once such killers have been brought before the courts, pleading guilty to their horrific crimes, it should be for the judge and the judge alone to give the appropriate sentencing in line with each specific case.  Why should that judge be overuled by the London appeal courts, bearing in mind a plea of guilty in this country automatically gives them a lower sentence.  When they are before the courts for a crime of murder with proven evidence against them, why should they be given a tariff. Life should mean life.",
