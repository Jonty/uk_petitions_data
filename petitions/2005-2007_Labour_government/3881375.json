            "background": "In the morning and afternoon you will often see lollipop ladies/men in their bright jackets and with their distinctive stop signs helping children to cross the road.  This serves a useful purpose in society.  However alot of these lollipop people are to be found at Pelican, Puffin, Toucan and Pegasus crossings and only attempt to cross the road whilst the 'green man' is there.  I believe that having lollipop people at these crossings is a waste of time and money as anyone who cannot understand cross when the green man shows is surely covered by survival of the fittest (or least stupid).  By not having lollipop people at these locations would free up resources to be used elsewhere, where crossing is more challenging - or possibly free up money to be spent elsewhere.",
