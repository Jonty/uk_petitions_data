        "action": "stop the planned A616 / A628 Mottram - Tintwistle by-pass as the plans are fundamentally flawed, serving only to increase traffic over an area of natural beauty and blighting the lives of residents east of the pennines.  Deadline to object is 30th March 2007 - object now !",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The planned by-pass solves a traffic density problem for the residents of Mottram - Tintwistle, but creates a problem for residents East of the pennines.  To the East of the Flouch (at the junction of the A616 & A628) traffic flows will increase on unrestricted & unsuitable roads, adding to the problems of local residents here and merely shifting the problem from one side of the pennines to another.  Over 1500 people objected to the original proposals in 2006 and local opinion against the by-pass is growing daily.",
