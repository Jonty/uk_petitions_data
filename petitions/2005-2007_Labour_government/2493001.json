            "background": "If a 10 year old hits a peer in the playground they can be taken to court by the parents (of the victim) and if they are found guilty will be given a schedule one, which bans them from working with children until the age of 75. What a child is like at 10 does not necessarily reflect what they are like when they are an adult and therefore punishes them long term for something which may have just been a small fight which got out of hand. the minimum age should be increased to a level where children can actually take responsibility for their actions, preferably 18, as this is maximum age of the victim, so any peer fighting would not automatically make you a 'danger to children'.",
