        "action": "Abolish the proposed congestion charging of commuter routes around Greater Manchester",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The proposed policy of charging commuters to use the main arterial routes in and out of Manchester City Centre is wrong. A commuter route charge would unfairly penalise those who live and work in areas that are not directly served by public transport links, which is a common problem within the city. The impact of this charge is completely unforseen by the city council and will result in a decline in business and lifeastyle opportunities for companies and employees alike.",
