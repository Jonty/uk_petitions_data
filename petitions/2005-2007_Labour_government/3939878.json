        "background": "In the USA Pilots that have mild degrees of colour defective vision can take a SODA test ( Statement of Demonstrated Ability) where they show an examiner from the air that they can see and recognise colours used in aviation and therefore demonstrate in a practical way that the colour defect is not relevant to the job in hand, instead of using the current test system of 60 year old books or tiny coloured lights in a darkened room or the more recently commissioned PAPI type tests. Let the pilot show they can do it in the actual job not some crazy university test designed to fail cvd pilots.\nColour Defective pilots from the USA fly over and land in the UK every day, yet UK pilots can't even get off the ground.",
