        "background": "Politically active groups are having an increasing and dissproporationate influence on both local and national politics.  These groups often appreciate and place greater value on our great British democracy, whilst the increasingly silent majority become steadily more disengaged from UK politics; allowing our great democracy to be unduly influenced by minority groups and the politically active.\n\nBy introducing a system of compulsory voting, the views of the majority of UK Citizens will be heard and in doing so, will help to ensure that minority groups are not able to have a disspropotionate influence on the political agenda in the UK.",
