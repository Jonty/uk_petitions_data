If all buildings were bound to conform to access regulations, i.e. wider doors, no external/internal steps, toilet and bathroom facilities on the ground floor etc. Families with small children (prams) and those with varying levels of disability through to those who are wheelchair bound would benefit. Our private housing and public buildings would have adaptable use for all eventualities and given time there would be cost saving due to the reduced need for major alterations.",
