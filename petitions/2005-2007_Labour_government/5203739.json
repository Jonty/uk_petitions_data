        "background": "The new Olympic Games logo has cost nearly half a million pounds and has resulted in a spectacularly negative reaction from the general public who have footed the bill.\n\nA design that incorporates what appears to be the Nazi Waffen SS lightening should not be seen as the symbol of the British Olympics.\n\nFar better that it is changed now, before a number of countries officially object to the Nazi-like symbolism.\n\nLord Coe has obviously lost his grip and should be removed from the Olympic Committee as soon as possible and replaced with someone who has some common sense.",
