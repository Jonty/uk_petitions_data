        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Teachers in most secondary schools are horrified at the thought of increasing the school leaving age higher than 16.  Whilst we all value and believe in education for all throughout life, we are tired of trying to enforce education on students over 14 who have become disillusioned with school.  Many wrongly believe that since their expected grades at GCSE are less than C there is no point in their continuing in lessons.  They are desperate to get out of school   and start earning.  To this end they behave in a manner disruptive to the education of the students in school who would choose to continue after 14 or even 16.  These less motivated students also waste hours of valuable staff time in trying to keep them productively engaged in school.\nWe propose that these students should be allowed to leave school at 14.  \nWe also propose that all citizens should have an allocation of education credits to be used at any age.  Hence when these previously disruptive students realise that they need education they can make their own choice to return into courses that will suit them for a chosen career. This will of course include the basic Maths & English that they opted out of previously.",
