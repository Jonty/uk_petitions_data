            "background": "This law is a disgraceful encroach on the citizen's of this countries civil liberties. It is a basic right to protest and more importantly for the basic right for Freedom of Speech and I do not believe that this should be prevented. This disgraceful law has been used against Brian Haw where he has had to dismantle part of his protest, and Maya Evans who was convicted for reading out the names of soldier who died in Iraq!! This is clearly not a violent protest but just another excuse this government has used to curb citizen's of this countries rights, a \"terrorist threat\" (from someone reading the names of soldier died in Iraq is hardly a Terrorist!). Please sign this petition this is an absolute disgrace.",
