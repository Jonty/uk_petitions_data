Why should we pay for time that a vehicle is not in use? A 4x4 would be an asset to my farm work. I wouldn't use my tractor for livestock haulage. I can't afford to tax & insure a 4x4 for the few occasions that I really need it.\nThe time for pay as you use technology has arrived. Forced taxation for unused time is dishonest and should be viewed in the same light as excess bank charges.",
