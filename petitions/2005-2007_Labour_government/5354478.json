        "background": "Games in the UK are rated by the BBFC just as films are. The BBFC have recently banned a video game which contains graphic violence. \n\nI submit to the PM that these violent video games are no less violent than movies/internet videos etc that contain even more realistic violence and crime. \n\nGames are given a certificate and they are purchased by parents and given to children lower than the rating suggests. \n\nInstead of allowing the BBFC to censor violent video games, we should rate them at 18 and require proof of ID or reasonable proof when they are sold. Punishments should be brought upon any parent or individual supplying such games to anyone lower than the rating given.",
