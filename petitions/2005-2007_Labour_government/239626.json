        "background": "Very many newspapers, especially tabloids, report very irresponsibly in my opinion.  Apart from the issue of convictions for crimes there is also an issue of what I would contend is incitement to racial hatred (which I thought was illegal) by stating that the perpetrator of a particularly abhorrent crime is an asylum seeker or immigrant when this is totally irrelevant; would the effect on the victim be any less if the perpetrator was British?  Also informing people of crimes such as \"happy slapping\", etc., thereby giving the idea to yobs to whom it hadn't previously occured and who then proceed to commit such crimes.",
