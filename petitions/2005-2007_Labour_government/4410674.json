        "background": "Why should sea anglers have to pay a license or have a strategy (that could find them bound up in restrictions) forced on them? \n\nThe commercial fleet have been so badly managed over the past 35 years and stocks of a lot of species have declined so much that most sea anglers don\u2019t get to see a good days fishing.\nIssues such as bag limits, no take zones and dictating of the methods chosen by anglers could be imposed on them once a strategy is in place. These would not be accepted by sea anglers as it was the commercial fleet that have ruined our sport.\n\n\nWe feel that without more and bigger fish it would be grossly unfair to impose a strategy or make sea anglers pay a license without first producing more and bigger fish.",
