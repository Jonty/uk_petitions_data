            "background": "In the early 1970's the method by which UK employees paid for their Social Security benefits changed from a 'flat rate system' to an 'Earnings Related (ER)System' (The Current system).\nIn return for ER Contributions, the Benefits, inc OAP,UB and Sickness Benefit had to be paid in line with your earnings.\n\nHowever since the late 1980's this link has been scrapped, and NICs are effectively an Income Tax on ALL your earnings, as no 'Tax Free' allowance is given. You also pay Income Tax on your NICs and if you are unlucky to be 'Unemployed' your benefit is also 'Taxable'!\n\nSo your Contributions INCREASED, but your benefits DECREASED.\n\nYou're also subjected to a 'Triple Whammy' of taxation on any benefits that you may receive.\n\nAlso UB was not 'means tested' until the contributor was 'out of work' for 12 months, (currently 6 months).\n\nThe exchequer receives in excess of \u00a390bn in NI contributions every year.\n\nIt is now time to restore the 'original contract' and all of the ER benefits included therein!!",
