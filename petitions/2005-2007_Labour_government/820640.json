        "background": "Issue a Registration plate to the Driver, not the vehicle.\nMaking the Registration Plate all of the required components for the vehicle to be Legal, would ensure instant Identification of any vehicle not Road Legal.\nIf any component was missing the Registration plate could be placed on the Police System.\nThe driver is then the registration plate & not the vehicle. Which is easily transferred between cars. \n\nThis would also eliminate the problems of change of ownership, as no one would leave their registration plate on a car when it is sold.\n\nNo driving Licence, no registration Plate. Would stop unlicensed drivers buying and using a vehicle on the road.",
