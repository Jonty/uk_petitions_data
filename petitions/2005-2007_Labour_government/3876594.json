        "background": "At present,Enduring Power of Attorney (EPA)forms are cheap,easy to create and administer especially as they only come into play when illness strikes.\nFrom the 1st October 2007, due to a new Mental Capacity Act,it is intended to replace the EPA with a Lasting Power of Attorney (LPA)which will be enormously more costly and difficult to administer.Also,it will provide more 'Stealth Tax'and allow the government to 'snoop' even further into our private affairs.\nI therefore call on all MP's to vote against LPA's or,at the very least,allow EPA's to continue for the foreseeable future in the present form alongside LPA's for those who prefer the old well tried and tested system.",
