            "background": "The current honours system has become so farcical that even Idi Amin might have found it hard to accept an honour were he alive. I urge you to sign this petition in order that we may rid this country of titles and unecessary letters that appear after peoples names. Of course people should be rewarded for their role in society but I feel and I think many others also do that our outdated and corrupt honours system is not the way to go about it. Therefore I urge you to sign away.",
