            "background": "A concurrent sentence is a prison sentence that is served alongside one or more other sentences, when the offender is convicted of more than one charge. If the sentences vary in length, the longest sentence is usually served. In some cases, a court will impose a consecutive sentence, in which the periods of imprisonment follow on from each other. This is a rare thing to happen indeed...\nSo if a criminal is convicted of multiple murders he/she will serve a life sentence for each murder \"at the same time\" (concurrently) - This should be changed to CONSECUTIVELY.",
