            "background": "Stop this now!\n\nThe government is planning to produce a study on motorbike speed limiters on the grounds of safety & emissions of green house gases!  This government is scientifically illiterate of the most basic facts, most motorbike tanks only use \u00a35 petrol at a time instead of gas guzzling cars >\u00a340 a time for a tank.  On the issue of green house gas emissions the biggest polluters are cars therefore it makes more sense to speed limit cars than a small minority of motorbikes!   On the issue of safety most motorbike accidents are caused by bad bullying car drivers with no consideration for other road users, especially 4x4's, volvo's & people carriers, who drive like tanks & bully everyone else on the road.  These vehicles should be banned for the many and a permit, further licence test for awareness of other road users be required instead.  Sometimes acceleration is required to get out of a nasty situations with car drivers who are either knocking you over or forcing you into a dangerous position on the road!  Tackle the car drivers attitude, don't penalise the motorcyclist! \n\nIt's the nanny state again and non-motorbike riders trying to remove the freedom to ride properly.",
