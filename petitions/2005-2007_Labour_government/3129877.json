            "background": "What is illegitimate debt?\n\nDebt that a country cant afford to repay without meeting its peoples basic needs.\nDebts on loans that the lender gave to oppressive regimes knowing that they were unlikely to benefit the people.\nDebts on loans that the lender knew were going to be stolen through corruption.\nDebts in payment for projects that failed because of bad advice on the part of the lenders.\nDebt on unfair terms, such as exorbitantly high interest rates and penalty terms.\n\t\n\nWhat is Needed?\n\nIt is important that safeguards are implemented to ensure that a similar debt crisis can\u2019t reoccur in the future.\n\nFull cancellation of unjust debts. Poverty stricken countries are in daily crisis and will continue to decline without the aid of debt relief.\n\nAn end to harmful conditions, which are imposed by institutions on the terms of repayment.\n\nFuture lending must be done in a transparent and open manner.",
