That means that I, and many others I have spoken to, miss Neighbours and wish it could be shown on a day we don't work. \nI feel that it is in the public interest for the BBC to show a Neighbours omnibus for people who want to stay in touch with Erinsborough.\nCome on Tony and Gordon, speak to Mark Thompson and make your people smile.",
