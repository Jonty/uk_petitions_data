            "background": "We feel that the time, money and effort likely to be spent on creating a Ministry of Justice, its offices, staff, recruitment, stationery, and all other overheads, would better serve the country in reforming the Home Office through the application of professional and knowledgeable expertise in administration, management and organisational practice.  \n\nWe find that the idea of two new ministries formed of one original is likely to increase government expenditure and administrative costs during the first few years of establishment and may result in even greater practical administrative confusion as the activities of the Home Office are separated.  \n\nWe further request that if the government insist on moving ahead with their proposal they submit a detailed plan of how the separation of the Home Office is to be undertaken, the costs of separation and the projected costs of establishing the Ministries of Justice and the as yet to be named Security ministry.",
