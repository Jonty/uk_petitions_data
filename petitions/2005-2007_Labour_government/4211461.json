One of the things I miss is being able to sit out in summer and have a drink in the daylight, as here, it gets dark around 5pm in Winter and 7pm in Summer.\nIf every Counrty adopted daylight saving, think of the savings in electricity in the homes, street lighting and so on.  Not to mention fewer road accidents and so on.\nIt will mean changes to time zones, and perhaps some countries will need to adopt quarterly changes based on their position to maximise daylight.\nIt will mean upheavel but surely its a small price to pay for the benefits it will reap.\nIt is a time for change in an ever changing world, we already use daylight saving and can lead by example.",
