        "action": "Pass as law the right for workers to receive there wages in cash weekly.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Make it law for workers to have the option to receive there pay in cash weekly if they wish, this would also create jobs and allow people to manage there finances better. At the moment there are millions of people deep in debt and houses being repossessed  at 52 homes a days. It is my belief that allowing workers the option to choose if they get paid in cash weekly or via there bank would help people avoid the pit falls of debit and the stress that comes with it.The only reason companies pay wages monthly and through the banking system is to save money thus increasing company profits. What is the benefit to the worker receiving there pay monthly through a BACS transfer, it only serves to make the banks profit whilst your money is in your account and the banks make enough profit as it is.For people on low pay it would be a god send to be paid weekly in cash, there are millions of people on low pay who go over there overdraft limit or have failed standing orders/ direct debits each month that they are the charged for by there bank at between \u00a330/\u00a335 for each one.",
