        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "School children have been subjected to an aggressive publicity campaign for EMA. Material such as coasters, rulers, wallets etc have been distributed in a manner akin to corporate promotions. This would be fine if all pupils were eligible. For those who are not eligible it amounts to a slap in the face each time the subject of EMA is raised. HMRC already have the information need to target this benefit accurately so why is there a need for the indiscriminate campaign. The money wasted on sending several huge application packs and all the promotional materials out indiscriminately could be much better spent elsewhere in the education system. This grant may be an incentive for apparently less well off children, but it is also a disincentive for children whose genuine family income places then just over the line. These parents genuinely cannot afford to give their children \u00a330 per week to put them on a par with their peers.",
