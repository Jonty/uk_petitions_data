            "background": "If Operating systems were written to include anti child pornography / hatred / terrorism software, that prevented users from uploading, downloading, or even viewing content considered to be against the law, then it becomes more difficult for the  perpetrators to sell their images. \nSure the problem will not disappear over night, if at all, but this will no doubt slow it down.\nAnd as far as freedom, look, the only people who complain about not being able to view the afore mentioned subjects on the internet, are the sick individuals commiting such crimes, and they belong in jail ( because any harsher comments will only result in this petition being removed ).\nIf you are reading this, you are eigther one of them, or one of us, ... , you decide.\n\nThank you for listening",
