        "background": "The proposed \u00a39bn cost of the forthcoming olympics games is a disgrace to, I suspect, the majority of tax paying people who would rather see the money spent on a multitude of worthwhile and life changing issues instead. Hospitals, Air Ambulances, RNLI, crime prevention, cancer research, prevention of child abuse, prevention of animal abuse, education, road safety etc etc etc have to be better areas of spending than games that most of us will neither attend nor see any benefit from the facilities at all. Please sign this petition to reduce the huge expenditure and see the money spent on areas which can make a lasting difference, not just for a few weeks.",
