            "background": "The use of copper is essential for the functioning of the country, such a telecoms and power. I ask the PM to move on implementing the follow measures to reduce copper theft: 1) Require adequate time between delivery of the copper (and other metals) and payment for authorities to examine, at least on a spot check basis, the transaction. Once the copper or metal is gone the chain of evidence is lost. 2) Require all payments to be made by cheque to a physical address for tracking purposes. 3) Create better and more targeted photo ID of the seller and the delivery vehicle. 4) Require a proper manifest to accompany the copper, when delivered so there is a possible trace, with the copper tagged at the yard until sold. 5) Turn the manifest into a license with a fee attached so additional Police enforcement can be funded. 6) Increase the penalties for these crimes to include damage caused (e.g. \u00a3150 worth of copper stolen created \u00a315,000 worth of damages, and then subsequent production loss of an additional \u00a325,000).",
