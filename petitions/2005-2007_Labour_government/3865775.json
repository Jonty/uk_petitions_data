As an example anyone wishing to marry a foreign national and settle in the UK together would have charges increased from \u00a3595 on 31/3/07 to \u00a31250 on 1/4/07 and the costs of naturalisation from \u00a3200 to \u00a3575. Far higher than inflation and any justification apart from another \"stealth\" tax.",
