            "background": "Up to 1997 vehicles over 25 years old did not have to pay for a Vehicle Licence disk. Hidden in the small print of the 1997 Budget the Government stopped the rolling exemption and now only vehicles which were manufactured before 31 December 1972 are tax exempt.We request that the injustice handed out to the Classic Car movement be reversed. Currently we have vehicles of the same make and model- some have to pay tax others do not depending purely on the date of manufacture.Most  Classic Car owners also have a modern car. Classic Cars cover very little mileage and therefore the tax is very high in proportion.",
