        "background": "This is about the rise in car cloning. The DVLA is trialling number plates with electronic chips in it and are looking to force all motorbikes to be fitted with them. The fact is that car cloning is to avoid fines or cars may be involved in theft. However very few motorbikes are  involved in such activities..even driving off without paying for petrol. The Government sees us as easy targets and a minority!",
