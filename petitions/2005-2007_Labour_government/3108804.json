            "background": "I feel ALL staff whatever their industry should be either paid double time or given a lieu day when they work on a Bank holiday.  Employers benefit from increased sales on Bank holiday days but the staff lose out in many industries.  It is unfair that they work for no extra benefit where staffs in other industry are given Bank holidays off as part of their normal companies\u2019 entitlement.  I feel the playing field should be levelled so all staff benefit from Bank holidays within the UK.",
