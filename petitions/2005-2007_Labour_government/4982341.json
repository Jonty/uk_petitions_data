            "background": "As a true football fan, I urge all other football fans to put their club allegiances to one side and urge the government to intervene in this morally corrupt situation. As tax payers, we fund a Sports Minister. His intervention now seems to be the only immediate course of action to ensure that West Ham United do not profit from their admitted breaches of Premiership rules and to ensure that justice is done. It is not good enough, in this instance, for Mr Caborn to state that it is up to the relevant footballing authorities to sort out this situation. Please, Mr Caborn, do the morally responsible thing and intervene to ensure that justice is achieved. Due to the events of Sunday 13 May 2007, I feel that this petition can only run for three weeks, as after that time, any response would be meaningless. I therefore ask all football fans to act urgently and back this petition if anything is to be achieved.",
