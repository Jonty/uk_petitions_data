        "background": "The Government is sucking funds from important public services, watching as it closes NHS hospitals, with the remaining hospitals falling further into the red, and the countries graduates completing their studies in thousands of pounds of debt.  Meanwhile, this Government is paying children to attend 6th form college!  In my experience, every student who is in receipt of the EMA would attend college anyway, and merely see what is up to \u00a330 a month as a bonus pay, on top of any monthly wage they earn from a part time job!  I think it is disgusting that students who do not qualify for the EMA often have to work a part time job and conduct their studies just to match their friends who are getting an extra \u00a330 a month to spend on drugs or alcohol.  This Government have denied the hard working middle class student equal treatment.  Am I the only person who feels this money would be far better spent on the forces, health services or school facilities and resources?",
