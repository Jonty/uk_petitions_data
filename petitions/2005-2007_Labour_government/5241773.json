        "action": "end attempts to extend anti-terror legislation which already stretches far beyond any other developed country.  Furthermore we call for a repealment of many of the laws which are gradually leading the UK towards becoming a police state for example ID card legislation and restrictions on the right to protest.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Instead of extending police powers it would be wiser to increase funding to the security services enabling them to gather firmer evidence and ensure safe convictions.  28 days is plenty of time to hold a terror suspect and gather information and instead of blindly listening to the police who are bound to ask for greater powers, listen to the people who desire law with libertarian sentiment.",
