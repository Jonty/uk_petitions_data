            "background": "This is to make sure here in Wales we have full legislative powers and are therefore truly inderpendant of England. The Natioal   Parl;iment of Wales 'Senedd' would have full powers over policies and all matters. We would therefore have are own UN, EU, Commonwealth departments and be full inderpend country members. True inderpendance is the way forward. Wales would have all its own departments such as NHS, defence, policing etc. This I believe will build a stronger Wales with more prosperities",
