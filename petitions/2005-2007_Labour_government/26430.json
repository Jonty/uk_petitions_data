The crews from these two stations spent many hours tackling the depot fire. They were rewarded with redundancy! \nOur communities do not believe the closure of the Stations was a safe, reasonable and fair decision. We believe it was just cost cutting at the expense of our safety.\nOur communities are still fighting to reinstate these Fire Stations, please help us and sign this petition.",
