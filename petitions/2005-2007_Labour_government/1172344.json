            "background": "The British Government requires me and all others like me to go to the Embassy in Manila to request permission to take our wives to the UK just for a visit. This request will only be granted after I have paid over 200pounds,which is non refundable if the request is refused. the total cost to make such an application is 150 pounds for air fair from Mindanao, 30 pounds for the overnight in Manila. Then taxi fares back and forth to the Embassy plus the fee of 200 pounds +for the interview,  and all the other expences like food etc. Plus the travel time. all I ask is for my birthright, which is that I choose who I marry not the Government. and that having made that choice I be allowed to travel freely and without hindrance to & from the UK accompanied by my wife. We would ask that the interview and payment be abolished. A qualifying peroid to prove our marriage is stable would be a better process.",
