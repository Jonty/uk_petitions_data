        "background": "The system would create an increasing ratio of 'punishment' to re-habilitation within prison sentencing. The intention being to discourage re-offending. For a first-offender, the first third of a sentence would be 'tough' with no privileges, the remaining two thirds being focused on rehabilitation. If the individual re-offends, the first two thirds of the sentence would be 'tough' with the remainder being focused on rehabilition. For any further sentences the entire sentence would be tough.",
