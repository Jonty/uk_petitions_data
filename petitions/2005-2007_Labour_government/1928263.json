            "background": "Retired members of the public generally have fixed incomes and have made thier contribution to society. It is only right that in thier twilight years they should not have to worry about bills.\n\nIncreased fuel costs in recent years have become a burden on many people and particularly for those on generally fixed incomes, they should be helped by providing more targetted relief. Those capeable of earning a living and not retired have alternatives available to them.\n\nTargetted relief to retired people\ncould be aimed towards those with an agreed annual total household income threshold, which for illustrative purposes I would suggest to be of \u00a320,000 a year or less, including from investments. Government can complete the detail.\n\nThose receiving pension credits could still for instance have this relief counted in thier calculated support.\n\nWhy see all the benefits of good government and stable finances of recent years be ruined by out of control fuel and other costs ?",
