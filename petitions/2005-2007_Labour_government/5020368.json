        "background": "Currently the government supplements low waged people's income with public money. This is in effect a subsidy for business at the expense of the public purse.\n\nIt is wrong that someone should work a full week and still have to claim benefits to survive. On the contrary, if someone works all week they should not only be able to have a decent standard of living but also make a net contribution to the tax system. \n\nThis situation must be remedied by a \"living\" minimum wage coupled to a fair tax system. We would suggest that the minimum wage should be at least \u00a38 per hour and that in general workers should be able to earn at least \u00a310,000 tax free.",
