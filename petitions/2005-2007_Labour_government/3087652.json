            "background": "I propose that the government properly examine the security measures forced on us at airports and admit that they are a huge waste of time and money and have done nothing to increase our safety. \n\nSpecifically I would like an acknowledgement that there are no liquid explosives that are dangerous in 150ml quantities yet safe in 100ml quantities and contained in a resalable bag. As anyone who flies knows this is the most pointless of a long list of idiotic and time wasting measures.",
