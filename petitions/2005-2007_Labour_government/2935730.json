            "background": "It is now common practice for the police to obtain DNA samples from 'alleged' offenders. These samples are not destroyed nor expunged (and thus remain on permanent record), even though the CPS decides that there is no case to answer, or that the alleged offender is acquitted at court. Whilst it is appreciated that there may be very good reasons for retaining these DNA records, the police service MUST show this 'very good reason' for their retention. It is contrary to basic human rights that our personal 'make-up' is stored by the police, even though we have not committed a criminal offence.",
