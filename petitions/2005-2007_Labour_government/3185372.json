            "background": "Companies take a lot of time and trouble to protect their staff from work related injuries. It is in their interest as time off work can effect a companies profitability. Many solicitors acting on behalf of their clients are only doing so for for their own gain as the end pay-out can be low. Some solicitors even insist that insurance be taken out to protect them against any loss. \nThis compensation culture is costing us all dearly in increased insurance premiums and additional work such as risk assessments and additional warning signs normally warning us of the obvious.\nLook at schools where the staff are frightened to let the children play. \nIt is about time people took on more responsibility for their well being instead of trying to make a quick buck or rather the solicitor a quick buck.",
