        "background": "Growing Leylandii hedges to deliberately antagonise, or lessen the quality of life for others should not be permitted under any circumstance.\n\nThey are not a British plant and very little benefit, if any,  accrues to our wildlife apart from pigeons.\n\nThese hedges should never exceed 3 metres  in height, and if owners don't keep them under control or if malice is behind growing them, they should be cut down to the 3 metre height or removed altogether.\n\nMalice can be proved if damage, through damp or mould, to other properties caused by lack of sunlight or if sunlight is reduced to growing plants in other gardens causing them to grow more slowly or die. Or if the roots of the Leylandii grow across a boundary and rob other plants of water causing them to wither or die over a period of 6 months or more.",
