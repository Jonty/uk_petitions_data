        "background": "Householders are constantly being urged to change their own light bulbs, but in actual fact, street lights that turn on at dusk and off at dawn use and awful amount of electricity, not to mention the motorways that are lit up for miles with extra lighting for the signs. This should be happening throughout the UK, not just the little people and we shouldn't have to pay more for it, they collect enough tax already from us!",
