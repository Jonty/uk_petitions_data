We are also liable to INSTANT fines for any number of minor infractions of the laws which very often are obscure and locally generated. My proposal is that ALL FOREIGN Vehicles be made to comply with this requirement and thus prevent blatent evasion and disregard for legal statutes required of UK drivers. Also an entry toll levy to be paid as we do in EU countries for using the roads.",
