            "background": "As we hear about Bird Flu in the news, the risk of a pandemic becomes closer to home.Walk into any factory farmed chicken or turkey building and it becomes clear why.\nOne small building is the home to tens of thousands of Birds never allowed outside In their life, and confined to this building for the rest of their life, crammed in with other birds living in their own filth.\nWhen one bird gets ill, for instance contracts Bird Flu, the disease spreads very quickly to all of them - often causing tens of thousands of Birds to be slaughted to prevent the spread of the disease. Take last months outbreak of Bird Flu at at Bernard Matthews farm \u2013 nearly 160,000 birds were killed. All this could have been prevented by better animal agriculture. Farmers are well aware that they have created a breeding ground for disease, so they dose their animals with massive amounts of drugs.\nEven history shows that every pandemic within the last 100 years was caused by animal agriculture",
