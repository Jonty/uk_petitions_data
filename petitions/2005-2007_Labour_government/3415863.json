Take last months outbreak of Bird Flu at at Bernard Matthews farm \u2013 nearly 160,000 birds were killed. All this could have been prevented by better animal agriculture. Farmers are well aware that they have created a breeding ground for disease, so they dose their animals with massive amounts of drugs.\nEven history shows that every pandemic within the last 100 years was caused by animal agriculture",
