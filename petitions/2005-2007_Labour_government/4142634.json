            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This landfill site opened with a max 4 year licience.  It has now been open for 20 years - has been given a further 10 years. The County Council voted against the continuation of this site due to the volume of complaints received from the public . The residents of the village do not want this site to remain open due to the pollution, noise, mud on the road, the site is within 200 yards of residents who have to put up with a commercial road sweeper every 10 mins, speeding lorries along a country lane, which can not be policed as the police have no  budget until 3 persons have been killed on this road!.  Our washing/homes constantly dusty due to dust coming from site. The road is so narrow that we don't even have white lines, however we are allowing 70+ HGV's along this road every day.  Over 100 horses live on this lane, owned by children - the consequence of mixing these two items is obvious.  The CC do not have the funds to put into place speed restrictions. Question: how at Appeal was this allowed to go through.  The only persons winning in this situation are SITA a French company - I do not believe that this was a democratic decision and we are supposed to live a democratic society",
