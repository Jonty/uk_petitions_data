We could replace this with a codified system of law in the UK similar to that of the USA, where all Acts are written into a logical section of a complete system of codified law. This code would contain a full set of logical Chapters and subsections. As a result, locating the source of written law would become easier.\n\nThis system could be extended to include unwritten common law principles as interpreted in legal cases. However, there would have to be a way of reconciling any differences in the common law between England and Wales and Scotland.",
