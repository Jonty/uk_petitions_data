As the British forces were operating under a UN mandate, to do nothing is not an option and is tantamount to appeasement",

            "background": "The world (United nations) has to find some way of taking action against Iran for entering Iraqi waters to kidnap British forces at gunpoint, and submitting them to humiliating acts on TV and threats to their person and playing mind games.\nIf the UN is not prepared to act, maybe its time Britain considers leaving the UN as appeasement does not work.\nIran must not be allowed to get away with these media stunts.\nFinally, we must put on record our thanks for their release and the professionalism and bravery under very difficult circumstances. They have proved to the world that they are heros and that the Iranian President and those in other high positions in Iran, are a danger to the world.",
