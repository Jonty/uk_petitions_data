Perhaps this can be attributed to the fact that they are not able to take an active role in making a difference and/or expressing their views and opinions.\n\nTherefore, if the age of voting was lowed to 16, these young people would feel part of the wider community and finally believe that they were able to make a difference for people of their own age and younger, who are not able to express their views through this method.",
