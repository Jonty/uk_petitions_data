        "background": "Every time you read the papers or watch the news a major British company has been bought over. I'm not against competition but there has to be a point where Britain can still hold its own in the world especially in the utilities sector which guarantees our national security. The Spanish, Germans and especially the French flout European laws to avoid their major companies being taken over so maybe it's about time Britain did the same and stopped national assets and British jobs going abroad.",
