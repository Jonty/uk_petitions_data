            "background": "With the current house prices being far beyond the reach of the majority of single men and woman - I suggest that the amount of bureaucracy surrounding buying land nearby a current housing area, obtaining planning permission for a suitable house and proceeding with the erection of a property should be reduced. \n\nAt present the price of land with planning permission is very high (in some cases up to 100x the price of land with no planning permission) leaving the purchase of the land with planning permission solely within the reach of those with current equity within the housing market. If obtaining planning permission in appropriate areas were a more straight forward process costing far less time and money the opportunity for people to undergo a single property self-build project would enable a larger section of the population to get onto the housing market \u2013 removing the strain on the council properties and government build schemes already in such high demand.",
