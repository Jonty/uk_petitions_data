            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "With another above-inflation rise in fare costs announced, travel by rail is ever increasingly becoming a non-viable travel option. In many cases return travel within the U.K is far cheaper by air than rail. It is surprising, to say the least, that an apparently environmentally concerned government should preside over such a ludicrous situation. Subsidising rail fares would bring far more people off the roads, out of aeroplanes, and reduce CO2 emissions, a levy on the currently un-taxed kerosene fuel could provide revenue for such a policy, please sign this petition.",
