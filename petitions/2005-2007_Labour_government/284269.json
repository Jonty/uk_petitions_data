            "background": "The Race Act in the United Kingdom, is the most unfair, politicaly biased, and racialy prejudiced peace of UK legislation in history. Taken at its face value, as it always is, the race act is there to protect every race except the indigenous white British. And with the escalation of so called political correctness going mad here, we must take extreme measures to bring it to a hault.\n\nThe Race Act must be abolished. Then if there must be a replacement, then a large group of independant and unbiased individuals must study the issues involving race, and come up with a fairer and more sensible solution. This act would be set in stone, and never subject to any kind of meddling by whatever political party takes power on any particular day.",
