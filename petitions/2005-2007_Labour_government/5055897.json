            "background": "The Banks and Building societies have made extortionate banking charges for too long now, making those most vulnerable, suffer even more, under the weight of stupidly high penalty charges. The current advise given to customers on how to claim their charges back, is being ignored by many financial institutions.\nThe Nat West and other banks/building societies should by law only be allowed to charge what it actually costs to deal with an issue..\u00a339 or there abouts for an issue that actually costs the Bank \u00a34.50, is stealing from the vulnerable and those who need most help..there must be a legal restriction on all charges, and a system where by any excessive charges can be met with stiff penalties to the Bank. Recent findings in favour of one Bank will unnerve those most vulnerable, and make the capitalist Banking system ignore pleas from their customers for reconciliation and reason. Legislation has to be put in place to protect the customer.\u2026",
