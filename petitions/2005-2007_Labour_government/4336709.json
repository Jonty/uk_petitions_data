Looking\nat how people are not put off by cautions and ASBO's. It would\nbe far better to introduce a Boot Camp system and when\ncompleted this would not give the offender a criminal record\njust a mark to allow the police to know he/she had attended a\ncamp. Depending on the severity it could be a two to four week\ncamp. And it must be completed within 4 weeks of committing the\noffence. The system is far to slow to punish offenders and\nbecause of this they re offend prior to attending court.\nWe want to see the introduction of Bootcamps as an alternative to the failing ASBOs",
