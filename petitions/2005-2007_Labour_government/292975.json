        "action": "Legislate to oblige MOT testing stations and insurance companies to issue expiry dated windscreen discs",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "These would be mandatory display by law on all road vehicles in addition to the current DVLA road tax discs.\nIssue of the MOT and insurance discs will be automatically advised to the DVLA, enabling them to introduce automatic tax disc reissue and online taxation services. The cost of the MOT and insurance discs will be borne by the issueing party.\nRoad tax can then be reduced to a nominal admin costs only amount for all road vehicles and the duty on fuel increased to maintain revenue whilst ensuring that those who use the roads most pay for it.\nThus all other measures to reduce road usage can be abandoned as the expensive and unworkable alternatives that they are.\nThe tax on fuels will be restructured to encourage use of low emission and no emission alternatives as they currently exist and as they become available.",
