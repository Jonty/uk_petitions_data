This affects both our wildlife, our     carbon emissions and traffic. A perfect example of this is a meadow close to me. A meadow, homed to mice, hedgehogs and butterflies destroyed to make a modern estate. Again adding     to traffic. Now we have to eat New Zealand apples that have travelled halfway across the globe. Because they are cheaper because they are easier to find. We urge you, action must be taken soon or England will loose it's beauty that it is famous for.",
