            "background": "Many shops are now selling alcohol, even more so the smaller shops etc. Shop owners are having alcohol licences renewed without the community being made aware or asked if the shop should be allowed to have a licence renewed. Some shop owners could have been in trouble for selling alcohol to minors and still have a licence renewed. The government should be making the renewal of relicencing tougher and letting the people in the immediate community have their say on the renewal of such licences.",
