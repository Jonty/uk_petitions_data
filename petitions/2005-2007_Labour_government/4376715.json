            "background": "Despite the fact that all Eurostar trains pass through Calais Frethun, only three a day stop there.   There are many people, both British and French, who would like to live in the Pas de Calais and commute to work in London or Kent, but the hours and fares do not encourage this.  Given the enormous cost of building the tunnel, it seems crazy not to have it play some part in the economic development of both sides of the channel.",
