            "background": "The Government continues year on year to hike up the cost of motoring. However, in recent years they have a new word to try and disguise the reasons for doing so. Its called the \"Green Tax\".\nWe all know, as do the government, that it will not stop anyone from driving (except the poorer citizens of the UK) and it is all about raising revenue but under a false claim.\nIf the Government were serious about looking after the enviroment then they would force car manufacturers to only sell green cars in the UK and make it policy that all homes are built with wind generators and solar panels. However we all know this will never happen as the Politicians, regardless of which Party they belong too, all see this as a major source of income to the Treasury. Please prove me wrong Mr Prime Minister.",
