            "background": "As it currently stands an employer only has to give you one month's notice that they want to change your contracted working hours by as much as they feel needed and you have very little protection to prevent it. \n   In my case, I\u2019m being  forced to work from 6pm till 2.30am Monday to Friday on a month's notice, forcing myself into any issue of either quitting and trying to find another job after 10 years of service at short notice (and worry about paying the bills in the mean time) or wrecking my family life at home. If I refuse to sign a new contract under these terms they are entitled to sack me and offer me the new contracted hours again. (If they feel fit)\n   Think of how much something like this would affect you and your family. Could you or your partner cope being put in a situation where you have a month notice to decide between not paying the bills OR not seeing each other or the family for 240 days a year?",
