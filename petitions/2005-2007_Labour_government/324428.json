No other treatment in the NHS for patients with such clear symptoms that has such well-researched benefits is rationed in this way.\u2019\nBRA believes it is in part a case of sex discrimination. \nLarge breasts cause back, neck and shoulder pain, excessive sweating, and rashes and infections, discourage exercise and trigger unwanted attention and psychological problems.\nSome 4,000 breast reductions are carried out on the NHS yearly. But some local primary care trusts refuse patients with a Body Mass Index greater than 25. Others accept those with a BMI of 32.\nThe clinical criteria should be standardised nationally so many more women can benefit.",
