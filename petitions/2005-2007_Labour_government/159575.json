        "background": "Public transport alone is not flexible enough within the UK - hence people hopping in their cars.  Switzerland has a better infrastucture - ALL public transport systems are linked to provide 1 service.  But the main thing is that there are safe places (designated roads) for people to use HPV's.  In essence bikes, but they have different styles of bikes offering better comfort for longer journeys.  Would also mean requesting all employers to provide wash facilities for people walking / cycling into work.  There are some major alternatives to any kind of motorised transport and a little exercise would also help with obesity problem! If this was already an option - people would find changing easier, but as it isnt they will simply run themselves a load of debt up to stay on the road, to keep working, to pay tax.",
