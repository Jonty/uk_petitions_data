        "background": "For an organisation, which has \u00a31billion+, p.a. to dispose of, isn't it about time people were made aware of exactly what it does and where the money goes? I left ACE appalled at the waste of money spent. Examples Inc; computer systems introduced but removed before completion, financial rewards to staff to name systems. Lollipops made especially for ACE & awarded to staff. Costly lunches for internal meetings. Unlimited Free drinks. Tax free loans to staff. Expensive away days that proved un-necessary because of policy changes. A 2 day virtually all expenses paid function in Brighton for every member of staff, which the majority felt was an offensive waste of public money. Vehicle expenses of up to 51p per mile. What seems to be an unlimited print budget. The list is endless. The awards also seem to be aimed primarily at inner cities and the most offensive thing I came across whilst working there, was that virtually no outsider knew what ACE did! THIS SHOULD BE CHANGED!",
