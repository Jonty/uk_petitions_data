The British government should not be allowed to spend so much time and money on international affairs such as the \"War on Terror\". How about a war on Illeagal Immigration; a War on Poor NHS Funding; a War on Over Taxing, a War on the Dictatorship that we here in the UK are living under. There are so many of your 'Wars' right under your nose. Take your head out of your a and have a look Mr B.",
