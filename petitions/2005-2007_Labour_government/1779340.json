            "background": "Most of us have seen the Grand National. It looks very harmless, but that's what they want us to think.\n  Around 370 horses are raced to death each year on our race-tracks. This doesn't count the horses that are killed before they even start racing because they are not fast enough. It's a similar story for greyhounds.\n  We are told they love racing, but they are forced to race by the million-pound industry that doesn't seem to care about the welfare of the animals that helped create their profits. Please ban the races, and help Britain become a nicer place for animals.",
