            "background": "This is an effort to bring down the continued bias of the BBC to big clubs and players. As recently as Sunday the 11/02/07  Thierry  Henry's dive in the 42nd Minute was omitted from the BBC's coverage whereas Chris Kirklands timewasting tactics were shown. I believe this is due to Mr Henry being a BBC \"Untouchable\" as it were, unlike a certain Ronaldo. I call on every fan of football who is sick of this sort of hyprocrisy by a organisation we pay for to sign this petiton and bring it into the public eye and make them change their bias ways.",
