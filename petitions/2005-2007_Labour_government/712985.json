        "background": "The Sia was born in 2003 after the Private Security Act 2001 to licence individuals working in the private security industry. They were meant to be self funding, with fees being appropriate to the cost involved in processing the licence and enforcement and administration of the industry and organisation.  So far, the licence fee has been set at \u00a3190.00, with an increase to \u00a3245.00 set to come in from 6th April 2006.\n\nUp to date, the SIA has done nothing much short of make a farce out of the industry.  Taking several months to grant and issue licences, and often rejecting licences for the most trivial of matters.  Enforcement and investigation has, at least in my part of the country, been little or non-existant.\n\nPaul Kay",
