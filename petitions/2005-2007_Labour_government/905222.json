            "background": "It is disgusting how when the EU or the governemnt does not get its way that it repeatedly keeps bringing its issue forward until such time as it gets its way and then that is the end of the matter.\n\nIf the EU constitution had been ratified the first time, would Merkel now be raising the issue again and saying it's time to see if we still want the constitution?  \n\nAbsolutely not! \nHypocrisy! \n\nThis is precisely why the people of Europe don't want it.  The system is unfair and un-democratic and if the prime minister is respectful of the peoples wishes he should ensure safeguards are in place to ensure the people are re-heard every 2 to 3 years regarding the EU constitution; certainly so if it is ratified.",
