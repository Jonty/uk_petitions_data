            "background": "Various food producers (usually convenience foods) and certain supermarket chains (eg Tesco) have ignored the traffic light system recommended by public health watchdogs and instituted a more complicated syatem.  These producers have also funded a TV ad campaign to \"educate\" the general public about the benefits of their labelling system, implying that these labels present more information, allowing the consumer to make a well-formed decision.  The red-amber-green system allows you to compare products at a glance and adhesion to this recommendation should NOT BE VOLANTARY.",
