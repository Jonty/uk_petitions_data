            "background": "All political parties urge us to save for our retirement, whether in a company scheme or a private pension fund. This involves considerable sacrifice, particularly when saving in a private pension fund, and \u00a3100,000 really buys very little in terms of an annuity. Yet having a company or private pension can often preclude the individual from receipt of some state benefits, leaving them worse off than if they hadn't bothered to save. The Government should investigate ways to ensure that all citizens who make provision for retirement are actually better off for having done so.",
