Why should they need to be lit when during the day they are perfectly visible and during the night because of their reflective quality they are just as visible.\nHow much money could be saved by not illuminating them. Its ok to keep on at Joe Public to do their bit to combat global warming but our governments need to be at the fore front, leading the way with sensible cost cutting methods. This is just one way of helping.",
