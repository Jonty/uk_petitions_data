            "background": "While industrial emissions have been regulated for decades the exemption of farmers from similar rules is damaging public health. Pesticides are designed to kill at low concentrations. Although they destroy insects, weeds and other pests most are highly toxic to humans. Research shows higher incidences of illnesses amongst farm workers and people living by farmland including cancers of the breast, prostrate & lung, parkinsons etc. Official reports warning of the danger were published by the Commons agriculture select committee and the British Medical Association. These proposed farmers warn residents before spraying and leave buffer zones around the edges of fields close to homes or other buildings such as schools. A study in California found pesticides spread up to three miles from where sprayed. Professor Vyvyan Howard, a toxicologist who sits on the advisory committee on pesticides claims the biggest threat is to developing children. A foetus can be affected by such tiny traces of chemicals, in concentrations as low as parts per trillion and that no exposure can be safe.",
