In recent years, they have become almost an opportunity for local authorities to maintain budget levels by spending on ludicrous over-direction and duplication of signage that has left the system looking more like a child's toy set. People are not so stupid as to need this... we managed fine for nearly a century without it. What spending is being cut in other important areas to finance this fiasco?",
