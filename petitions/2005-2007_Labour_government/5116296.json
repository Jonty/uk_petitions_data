            "background": "This petition is not in any way a criticism of NHS A&E staff. They work in difficult circumstances however Accident and Emergency Department waiting times are unacceptably high. No one who is ill or in pain should wait more than one hour for treatment. \n\nHospitals give triage assessments but then sit people in waiting rooms for hours. Because a Triage nurse has seen the patient it appears on paper that patients are being treated quicker than they are in reality. This is a  manipulation of waiting times to meet targets. \n\nIt is not acceptable to see a triage nurse within minutes of arrival but then have to wait 2-4 hours for treatment by a Dr. Patients should be TREATED within a reasonable time, not briefly seen and put to the back of yet another queue. \n\nHospital Managers within each N.H.S. Hospital should be made more accountable and should have publicly justify each and every patient who is not TREATED within one hour of arrival at any Accident and Emergency Department. Having to explain each and every delay over one hour will ensure waiting times are reduced.",
