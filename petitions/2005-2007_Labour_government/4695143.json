            "background": "Sky tv should be broken up. It should not be allowed to continue with the monopoly it has on satellite tv. It should never have been allowed to buy bsb in the first place. After this the controlling interest that Rupert Murdoch has in Sky and its other related British divisions such as the News of the World should be broken up.  No one person or company should be allowed to have as much of a stake in as many parts of our communications industry especially since many of these are market leaders. Furthermore, Sky should be forced to sell any shares they have in terrestrial tv companies or radio stations.",
