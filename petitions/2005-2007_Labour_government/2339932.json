For over 10 years we have been organising safe events with the aim of diverting young people from acts of youth annoyance and taking drugs and alcohol.  Over 900 attend our monthly events and these are supported by the Police, Council and partly funded by the Community Safety Partnership.  They have been proven to reduce crime.  One special event is held on Halloween and has helped reduced reported crime by 35 % and the use of fire works by 52%.  I would like to see more events of this nature that promotes a more positive side of young people today and not the negative images the press always seem to portray.",
