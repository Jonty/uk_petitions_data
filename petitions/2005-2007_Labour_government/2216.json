            "background": "Since the introduction of university tuition fees, many thousands of talented young people from deprived backgrounds have not gone to university. In 2006 came the introduction of variable fees; the next stage of the marketisation of English higher education. This will invariable lead to those poorer students going to poorer universities, whilst the rich students go to rich universities. This is unfair, inequitable and unsustainable.",
