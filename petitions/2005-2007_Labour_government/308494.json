            "background": "I am aware that many people keep un-sterilsed cats trapped in their homes to continually breed for their own profit. The private seller DOES NOT do a home check and they therefore do not have the kitten's interest at heart. Most animal charites do thorough home checks (road checks - suitability etc). The animal charities are swamped with homeless cats and kittens.  I therefore do not see a reason to allow the unrestricted sale of continually breed kittens.(i.e not more than one litter).  There are charities that can perform cat sterilisations for free or at a reduced cost.  People need to be made aware of the proper cost and care of a cat and they are not going to get that information after they have just collected their trapped kitten (often taken away too early from their mothers - and often so unhealthy that some people have had a kitten die on them in the first few days of buying it).  The Government could ban the sale of kittens through classified ads, internet, shop windows etc.",
