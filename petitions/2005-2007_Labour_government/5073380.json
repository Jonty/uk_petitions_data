            "background": "Many people including people who are unemployed have borrowed money and / or spent their savings to get training for this. If people have borrowed money to pay for this training, they now have very little prospect of being able to earn enough from doing the work to pay back their debts. The government should take responsibility for their complete mismanagement of the HIPs implementation, and offer to reimburse these people who have paid out for HIPs training. Where unemployed people have been referred to this training by jobcentres and have taken out Career Development loans, these should be written off. It is plainly not fair or advisable that the government should make such significant mistakes while leaving their citizens to pay the price (literally). This debacle will have ruined many lives, leaving people not only very disappointed but, also in a great deal of debt as well, in some cases. The government can't do anything about the broken dreams but, they can at least ensure that people are not financially ruined as well.",
