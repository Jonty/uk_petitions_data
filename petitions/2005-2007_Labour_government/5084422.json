Since then I have created a considerable number of petitions myself; I do accept that duplicates of already-existing petitions are rejected but if one feels that one's own petition was NOT duplicated (and also feels strongly enough about it to want to re-submit it) one can spend a VERY long time, sometimes, looking through all possible petitions to find the one perceived to be similar so that one can alter one's own petition for it to be reconsidered.  If there is a mechanism to find duplicate/similar petitions why is it not equally possible to identify the specific duplicate/similar petition to the creator?",
