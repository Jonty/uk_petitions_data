(Other than that the result of any donation or loan should not be a\nseat in the House of Lords). I do however have very strong views on\npolitical parties dipping their hands into my pockets to fund their\nactivities as their membership income is falling.\n\n I am a member of a political party, and  thus support it through my membership subscription. Conversely by subscribing to one party I am by definition withholding my money and approval from all other political parties. \n\nPolitical parties should realise that lack of income due to falling party \nmembership is an indication that parties do not have general support. NOT \nan indication that taxpayers should have to support them. If political \nparties need more funding, then they need to appeal to a wider section of \nthe general public, who might then take up membership.\n\nI, and others, should not be compelled to support political parties, that I \nand others, by withholding membership and subscriptions indicate our \ndisapproval of.",
