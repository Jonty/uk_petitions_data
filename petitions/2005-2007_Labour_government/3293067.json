Once they go to work, even for a few hours a week - it all stops! Sorry, but am i the only one thinking that this is an incentive to stay out of work and keep having children? Shouldn't there be real incentives to help them work and i don't mean enforced childcare. can't our government help WORKING families more instead?",
