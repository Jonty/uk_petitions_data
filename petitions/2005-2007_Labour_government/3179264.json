            "background": "Because of the massive depletion of council homes and fast deplinishing amount of low cost housing, I think it is now necessary to allow councils to build new council houses. A return to this system seems necessary and now sensible due to the continuned, uncontroled housing boom. Housing Associations alone are unable to cope with demand that can only increase as less and less people can afford to buy their own home and private rents esculate. Also a complete stop on selling council houses would be prudent too.",
