            "background": "We motorists want an end to congestion.  The best way to do so is by a balanced policy of improvements to roads and public transport funded by a congestion charge.  This charge to be introduced gradually over time to replace the tax on petrol (fuel duty) and the tax on the use of cars (Vehicle Excise Duty).  \n\nCalculate the congestion charge in-car by using the same technology used for in-car satellite navigation.  Therefore cars would not be tracked by satellite.  Payment to include a method like that used by people to pay for their pay-as-you-go mobile telephones \u2013 again to avoid any sense of \u201cBig Brother\u201d.  \n\nGiven that most roads most of the time are not congested and that most congestion in Britain is inside and around the M25 the vast majority of motorists would save money.  \n\nTravelling in rural areas, which is most of Britain, would be untaxed and petrol could cost just 25 pence a litre.
