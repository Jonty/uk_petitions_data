        "background": "The greater the need of an individual, the harder it becomes to distinguish between what is a social care and a health need, as these become synonymous. With increasing integration of health and social care services, the distinction is increasingly redundant. The Health Act 1946 proclaims that all health care will be provided from cradle to grave. Does this mean that disabled people are discriminated against by paying for healthcare? There is a HRA issue as disabled people could be frustrated via the legitimate expectation that their care needs should be addressed. Failure to address this issue is an abuse of power by the responsible authorities. This requires investigation, discussion and action to identify, quantify and to address the need for individualised care that address the holistic needs [Maslow, 1970] of an individual. Will we ever be able to truthfully say that disabled people enjoy greater independence and freedom of choice in how they lead their lives.",
