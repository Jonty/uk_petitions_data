            "background": "Currently, unless both parties are working 16 hours a week or more, you are not entitled to the childcare element of tax credit.  \nHowever if you are attending a full time university course you still require full time childcare.  \nUniversity courses or any course for that matter come with a great deal of work themselves without having to work an extra 16hrs per week and it is more time spent away from the home.\nMany mature students have had to drop out due to the pressures of combining the course and children alone. \nIt is prefered that you concentrate on the course as research has shown that students who work part time on top of their courses don't tend to do as well as those who didn't take up part time work.  \nWhen one parent is working and having to pay huge amounts for childcare, it can be a strain on finances and relationships.\nSurely if children have to attend a childminder or nursery, the families are entitled to the childcare element",
