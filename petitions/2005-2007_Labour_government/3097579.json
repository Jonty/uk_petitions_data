            "background": "The selective system in Buckinghamshire is undemocratic and discriminating. Here in Aylesbury only 3% of local children pass and attend the three grammer schools. The other 97% of those who attend these three schools live outside of the town or outside of the county. The three upper schools struggle to cope with the huge number of children who have to attend and in some cases children are given schools in High Wycombe(35miles away). The upper schools are over subscribed and under funded. I for one take pride in the fact that I live in a demorcratic country, however in Buckinghamshire we live in a dictatorship, where the minority rule. This education system was last put to the vote in 1950, 57 years ago, ludicras!",
