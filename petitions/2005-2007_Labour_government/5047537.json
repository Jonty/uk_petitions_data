            "background": "The case of Madeleine should have raised the profile of a long history, and ingrained series of crimes committed by despicable people, hundreds of children across the world, taken from their families - the media however choose to only see the one case, and to make futile requests. Spreading the faces of hundreds of others, could have lead to leads to break into these rings, to find many others responsible, to reunite families with lost loved ones, and hopefully find a lead for Madeleine herself.\n\nInterpol is in the perfect position to help police these crimes, to work with governments and national police services the world over, to take on responsibility for global crimes against children, teenagers, and young adults taken for things we never want to think about.\n\nWe call for Debate to be raised at national and international levels to start working against these criminals in a organised global effort spear headed by Interpol.",
