            "background": "In the winter all public buildings seem to have heating facilities, but most lack cooling facilities during the warmer months. Therefore we request that it be made law, that all public buildings (including, but not limited to, schools, libraries, restaurants, public houses, churches) have adequate air cooling facilities. Ideally these would be in the form of air conditioning units, but other measures such as dehumidifiers and fans would be acceptable if the first is not suibtable for finanical or practical reasons.",
