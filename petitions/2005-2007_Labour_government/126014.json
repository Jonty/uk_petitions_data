            "background": "Arsenal Football club is a blight on Britain.\n\nThey have just two UK players in their squad, limiting home grown talent the chance to achieve. Development of home grown talent could lead to a better World Cup performance than 2006.\n\nArsenal allegedly bribed their way into the top flight after the suspension in the league, due to the World War 1.\n\nArsenal had finished 5th but the club chairman is historically suspected of buying their promotion. The club abused the tragedy and disorder of the The Great War, which shows no respect for the sacrifice made by thousands. \n\nDuring the construction of Highbury, a horse accidentally fell into an open pit, where the foundations were being laid. It was not rescued but buried under the North Bank Stand.\n\nArsenal is therefore associated with underhandedness, disrespect, retardation of British talent, bribery, unsporting behaviour and cruelty to animals. These things undermine our culture.",
