            "background": "I have a friend expecting her first baby; she has recently changed to a different hospital for ante-natal care and tells me that this hospital does provide such classes but the previous one did NOT.  She also told me that the National Childbirth Trust provides these classes but that they charge quite a lot for them.  Where does this situation leave a women in her first pregnancy whose hospital doesn't provide such classes and who can't afford those of the N.C.T?  She must approach the prospect of labour with total fear which, at least in the first stages, would actually increase the amount of pain she would suffer; this, in turn, might very well affect her feelings towards the baby and/or her ability to bond with it.",
