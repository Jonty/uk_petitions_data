The people of the area ask for their voice be heard and to find alternative area to build the railway station.\nWould the planners please also examine the effects of yet more tunnels under London both in terms of support for buildings and flooding should sea levels rise as predicted and submerge parts of London by 2080 because of earth warming.\nWould it not be better to find alternative means of transport through London like Trams keeping options flexible but providing a good reliable alternative to transport by car!",
