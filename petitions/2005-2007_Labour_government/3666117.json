            "background": "it will be a great sport to add to the olympics. Such professionals as Phil \"POWER\" Taylor and Raymond Van \"MAN\" Barneveld who played out a great PDC final last year eventually going BARNEY's way 7-6 in a tie breaking set. I also think if it goes ahead PDC and BDO players should be allowed into the event. Due to Barneveld's victory only the second PDC world championship overseas player to win the World Crown means that it will not only be British medals all around be cause if it was like that it would mean its not a completely fair balanced event. I am also 1 of the many Darts lovers around the world and watch the sport at every possible occassion.",
