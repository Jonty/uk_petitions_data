            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Vehicle confiscation is a rare event which should be increased.  Those without the required documentation put the burden on to the law-abiding citizens of this country. They evade capture & fines by supplying false addresses & never being tracked down.\n\nA car must have insurance & MOT certificates to be taxed. Therefore the tax disc is an efficient method of filtering out those who may be flouting the system.  Those with recently expired tax could still reclaim their car by renewing the tax disc & presenting it at a police station.\n\nA system of active Police confiscators funded by the on-sale or scrap value of the cars would ensure financial sustainability.\n\nOverall, this scheme would have a huge positive effect on the safety of our roads, much more so than speed cameras, while simultaneously reducing the cost burden of ever-increasing insurance premiums.",
