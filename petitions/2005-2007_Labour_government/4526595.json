We feel that fortnightly collections are:\n\n* it an infringement of our existing rights\n* poor value for money for our council tax\n* an environmental hazard, with waste remaining uncollected for long periods of time.\n\nWe feel the government should ensure that weekly bin collections are reinstated for those areas currently with fortnightly collections, and no further moves made to fortnightly bin collections in the future.",
