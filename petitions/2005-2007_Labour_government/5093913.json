Therefore, any threat to National Security, whether internal or external in origin, can never be used as a justification for amending or repealing Human Rights legislation.\n\nIt follows that the argument that infringing Human Rights saves lives can never be valid. This is because it is accepted that lives are expended in defence of National Security, and therefore it is equally worthy to expend lives in defence of Human Rights.",
