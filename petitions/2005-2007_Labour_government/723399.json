            "background": "Owners of second homes that are left empty for most of the year (awaiting the owner's holiday occupation) deny other citizens the use of property.  This is the case whatever the price of the home.  They also deny the local community of a resident who could be financially, socially and practically active in the community, particularly in rural communities.  This degrades community life.  The council tax should reflect a significant penalty to this.",
