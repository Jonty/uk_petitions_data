            "background": "Other petitions have mentioned specific drugs (DCA - dichloroacetate) where promising new uses of off-patent drugs are not trialled because there is no incentive for manufacturers (who normally fund clinical trials).  As such trials would be of public benefit they should be publicly funded.  In England and Wales the appropriate body is the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE).  It would be worthwhile for such trials to be internationally funded (e.g. through the European Union), but this would be a longer-term aspiration.",
