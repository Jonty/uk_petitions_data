            "background": "A proposal to introduce a National Service requiring all UK Citizen school leavers to serve 1 year in a role which gives something back to the community and the Country. Roles will include military, emergency sevrices, public services and voluntary organisations, therefore providing the widest possible breadth of opportunities.\n\nService would commence upon leaving full time eduction (either 16, 18 or post-university).\n\nThis is not about boosting the country's armed forces. This is about instilling in young people a sense of pride in this Country and giving them the practical skills to operate in society. Learning to deal with responsibility, to respect authority and to take pride in their work. Learning self-discipline, a trade, team work and respect for other people. \n\nLet's give young people a bit of a boost and the best start and help create a cohesive society.",
