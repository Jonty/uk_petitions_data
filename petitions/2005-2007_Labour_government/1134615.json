            "background": "As a point of fact, biblical and historical scholarship has absolutely disproven the Christian religion as it is practised today. 15 years ago, children studying Higher Grade Religious Studies learned about objective scholarship like this and were, therefore, more able to become \"independent and critical thinkers\" (to quote Governmental education policy)- until complaints from Christian groups/churches forced a \"non-controversial\" curriculum into our schools.Investigative learning skills are a vital part of education - and learned in this way may help to stem the growth & political influence of deeply intellectually retarded evangelical Christian fundamentalism.",
