            "background": "Smoking bans affecting largely privately run establishments will have no baring on irritation caused by smoking in the street. In cities, towns & countryside one has to persistently dodge plumes of the stuff. On a windy day the problem is exacerbated and sometimes one has to breath it in from 50 or more yards away. And then of course there is the risk of ash getting in your eye too\n\nThe same applies when standing on railway station platforms for virtually guaranteed a smoker will bowl up. Politely asking them to move away can be risky; if lucky enough to escape abuse or worse one is rather fortunate\n\nIf confronted by an indignant & stubborn smoker anywhere & one were to make a verbal riposte it risks malicious attack, arrest, being DNA'd & subsequently criminalised for gently tackling what amounts to antisocial behaviour \n\nSo if you would like to breathe smoke-free air on our streets, bus & railway stations as well as in expensive restaurants then please sign this petition",
