If identity cards, passports and services are linked by the same number e.g. National Insurance Number - then services can be allocated to those who are entitled.  Crime detection and prevention will also be easier, isn't it a shame when you have clear pictures on crimewatch, but no-one in authority can identify who the criminals are?",
