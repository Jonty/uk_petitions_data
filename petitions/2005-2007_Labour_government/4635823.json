        "background": "Manchester does not need a congestion charge.  It is not a similar situation to that of London. It could create havoc for small businesses and have an adverse effect on visitors to this wonderful city.  Why do we pay road tax if the entire country is going to be paying other road charges left right and centre?  It is a very unfair taxation and Manchester does not need it.",
