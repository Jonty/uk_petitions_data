They are simply not domestic enough to roam our streets and are a safety hazzard to drivers...unless you can get each of them to wear a glow print jacket! I'm sure this applies more to Londoners than anyone else. I am currently living with my parents, who are both disabled, they are constantly having to wake up during the middle of the night to scare off the foxes to avoid them ripping our refuse bags. I'm sure many of you have been involved in a same or a similar situation. Therefore, i kindly requst from you all, if you agree ofcourse, to sign this petition to bring back fox hunting.",
