            "background": "Those who cannot earn sufficient to provide themselves and their family with a basic standard of living may receive means tested benefits including tax credits.\n\nIf those who receive tax credits manage to increase their earnings, the effects of income tax, national insurance and tax credit clawback can combine to create an effective marginal income tax rate of approximately 70%.\n\nThe tax credit system attempts to encourage employment but does this with so many conditions that it can be seen as de-motivating, bureaucratic and unreliable.\n\nRather than devise ever more complicated incentives and penalties to move people out of the \u201cPoverty Trap\u201d we ask that the government allow all its citizens the right to a maximum marginal effective income tax rate of 40% and ensures the delivery of that right by ignoring for all other purposes any income upon which 40% of tax has been paid.",
