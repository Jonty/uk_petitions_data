        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Wigan council propose to sell off land for development that is in the heart of a conservation area, the plans are flawed in many areas, not least the water drainage from the site which will be run into the local flashes. They also want to build a new road through the centre of the flashes which will affect many creatures and their habitats. The effects of all development will be to destroy a natural ecosystem with light,noise,litter, construction teams, and fuel particulates being washed into the waters where rare creatures reside. I urge people to go to the Wigan MBC website and view the plans and sign against this issue, it is called Westwood park and the road is the A49 link road.  David Bellamy has viewed this area and loved it. This has the potential to be irreversable damage, it's time to back up the green credentials with direct action. How about it Prime minister?",
