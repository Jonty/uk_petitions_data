        "background": "We move to change the official 2012 olympic logo from that which has publicly unveiled to something more agreeable to the general population as we do not feel the current design represents the nation in an acceptable manner, hence we strongly suggest either a public referendum on options chosen by panel or a nationwide design competition to be voted on by the public.\nTo expedite this process, an established method such as telephone voting could be initiated and in turn assist in re-couping the portion of the olympic budget wasted on the present logo.",
