Therefore, I call on you to do the following:\n\n1. Push for the immediate deployment of the already-authorized UN peacekeeping force.\n\n2. Strengthen the understaffed African Union force already in Darfur until the UN force can be deployed.\n\n3. Implement a fair and lasting Peace Agreement.\n\n4. Increase humanitarian aid and ensure access for delivery.",
