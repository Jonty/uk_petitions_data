            "background": "Such systems are successfully used elsewhere -for example in Holland. Secondary education here is failing to deliver results in many different ways and is placing schools under increasingly heavy bureaucratic burdens. Freeing them to develop their individual strengths would transform the situation, as it has in existing private schools. Most of the current administrative costs would be saved and could be used to give additional assistance to the most needy new private schools -eg. inner city schools.",
