            "background": "More and more companies are selling our data to other companies to raise extra revenue. Many, as I have found recently, are doing so without informing customers that their details will be sold or used by their own company to promote their other goods and services. This is especially true when contact details are collected verbally.\n\nCurrent legislation is not working so a total ban on the trading of consumer data should be imposed. This would dramatically reduce the number of telephone sales calls we have to hang up on as well as helping the environment by reducing the amount of junk mail.",
