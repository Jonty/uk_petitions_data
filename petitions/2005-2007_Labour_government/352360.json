            "background": "Her Majesty's Armed Forces are fighting a war in Iraq and Afghanistan and peacekeeping in Bosnia, Cyprus and Northern Ireland. They need more helicopters, better equipment, better housing in the UK, better medical facilities. These cannot be provided from the current defence budget. We are a rich country and are proud of our Armed Forces. We need to significantly raise what we spend on them so that they are treated fairly. Please sign my petition to help this happen.",
