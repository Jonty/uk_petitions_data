            "background": "The HMRC(the Inland Revenue) provide free online software for taxpayers to complete their tax returns online.\nThis is very anti-competitive and would not be allowed if the HMRC were a commercial organisation \u2013 why \u2013 because in the long term it reduces choice and is bad for the \u2018consumer\u2019.\n\nInferior to several cheap commercially available pieces of software - it does not cope with capital gains, non-resident, foreign income, share-schemes etc, but very difficult to compete with as it is free.\n\nFree ? HMRC will not disclose how much taxpayers money goes to develop and support it, but admit to at least \u00a3750,000 just in advertising it.\n\nFor free or cheap tax software you could allow the taxpayer to subtract from their tax bill the cost of purchasing commercially produced tax software up to say a maximum of \u00a320 and ban the HMRC from giving priority to its software.\n\nDo we want HMRC a monopoly supplier of both software for the citizen and backend processing ?",
