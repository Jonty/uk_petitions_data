        "background": "Many mothers prefer there children to be bought up by relatives rather that an outside minder. In this case they can not receive the child minders allowance. This is totally unfair as it should be given to everyone. With house prices these days many mothers do not have the priviledge to bring there own children up but must return to work while the child is still very young. This is a totally unfair system and should be changed so that relatives minding the child can be paid at the same rate as a  registered child minder",
