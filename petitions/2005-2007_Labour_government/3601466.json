            "background": "WiFi hotspots in the UK are currently almost all pay as you go, and in most cases very expensive to use.  The question is why?  WiFi as a product costs very little to setup and has practically zero maintenance costs, so why do companies charge anything between \u00a35 and \u00a310 an hour for you to connect to the internet?  What is being suggested here is that the government do what forward thinking countries like South Korea have been doing for 3 years and provide free WiFi hotspots nationwide for people to use whilst they are roaming, it's simple and inexpensive.  Plus it will force the heavy charging companies to provide free hotspots.",
