            "background": "The QEII hospital in Welwyn Garden City is under severe threat of partial closure. Following the devastating news that a super Hospital at Hatfield will not be built, a consultation is about to get under way into the closure of acute services at either the QEII in WGC or Lister in Stevenage.\n\nThat's 14 miles away, up a motorway which narrows to two lanes and is notorious for snarling up. In addition there are no direct public transport links.\n\nBut the potential decision also makes no sense from a geographical point of view. The majority of the population served by the hospitals lives within easy reach of the QEII in WGC and yet for some reason our acute hospital services are being stripped back!\n\nCurrently under threat is Maternity, Paediatrics, A&E, Surgery, Elderly Care and much more besides.\n\nWe believe that these cuts are dangerous and will expose us all to unnecessary risk. Indeed, they may cost lives!\n\nJoin Grant Shapps MP and petition against NHS closures.",
