            "background": "More and more SURPLUS Armed Forces bases are being left vacant. The MOD then sell these to the construction industry for a pittance. The MOD is then amazed tthat 6 months later the construction company makes \u00a3 millions selling the land and/or the homes that it has built on it. Let our servicemen and women get first chance on this land by splitting the bases into building plots and selling them off piecemeal. Any left over could then be offered to core workers and/or local housing association. At the moment everyone gets a raw deal except the big construction companies and as most of them are OWNED abroad do something for the citizens of this country.",
