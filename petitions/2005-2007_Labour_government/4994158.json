            "background": "In March 2007 The Highways Agency started a scheme designed to try and reduce congestion on the M25 at junction 12 and give road users a consistent and reliable journey time.\n\nIn order to achieve this they have reduced the M3 southbound to 1 lane through the junction. They say that \"this  disbenefit will have to be compared with the cost benefits to M25 traffic joining the M3\". M3 motorists now have to endure daily southbound tailbacks at peak times. I understand that M25/M3 slip traffic still queues at peak times.\n\nThis Petition campaigns for the restoration of the 2 lanes southbound on the M3 through the scheme.\n\nMore details can be found on the Highways Agency website.",
