            "background": "As fireworks can now be bought and lit all year,people with guide dogs and pets do not know when they have to bring them in or get medication for them from their vet.\nWild animals are unable to search for food as they are scared of the noise.\nRockets are now so loud they can be heard by the human ear for 5 miles, animals hearing is more acute than ours, therefore they can hear these fireworks for a much greater distance.\nWe would like to see a law that allows fireworks to only be lit at set times and days. For the sale of fireworks to match these dates.\nMany of young children and the elderly are frightened by the noise from fireworks.\nFireworks are being mis-used.",
