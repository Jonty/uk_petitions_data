            "background": "This Hospital serves a growing \nEast Yorkshire, town, and the surrounding villages and communities.\n\nIt offers care to all including a large number of local care OAP's, many of whom would need to make journey's of some distance, we have been told, even as far as Goole, on an evening for emergencies, which would involve a journey in excess of an hour to get there.\n\nThey are constantly building new housing estates and expanding the number of people resident in the area, and it does not make any sense closing the Hospital down, which would benefit the local communities more by expanding rather than closing.\n\nThis government has had 10 years of unfilled promises over Health, could they not see sense before they are voted out at the next election andf do the right thing.",
