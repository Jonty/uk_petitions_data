            "background": "The country needs more trained scientists and doctors. Government advertise for Physics teachers and getting kids interested in science. In reality these are tough university degrees compared to other career options. Average time in lectures/laboratory is 25 hours a week. Other degrees can be less than 10 hours a week. I am suggesting a review of the tuition fee and student loan system for key subjects at university. Maybe bring back bursaries for Science/Medical degree courses.",
