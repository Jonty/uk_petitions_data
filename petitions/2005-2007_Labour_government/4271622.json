            "background": "Selecting the England football team only from teams outside the premiership will take away the pressure of expectation from fans and the media and will relieve Premiership teams of any obligation to buy English players. Players in lower leagues will also be more motivated than Premiership players to perform for their country. As a result even a 0-0 draw against Israel will be seen as a positive result.",
