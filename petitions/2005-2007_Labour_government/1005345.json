            "background": "British expats upon their return to the UK are told that they or their children will be classed as an \u2018international\u2019 student if they apply to university. To be classed as a \u2018home\u2019 student you must have been resident for 3 years previous to the start of your degree, irrespective of how long you have lived in the UK for previously. British Citizens who have only been out of the country for a few years are forced to pay the extortionate \u2018international\u2019 fees, which are at least quadruple the normal \u2018home\u2019 fees. People who are residents of EU countries or have only lived in the UK for the minimum 3 years are able to pay the lower fees, whilst those who have lived for the majority of their lives in the UK, are expected to pay the exorbitant \u2018international\u2019 fees.  \nThe system is preventing UK citizens from studying in their own country, or forcing them to wait 3 years.",
