            "background": "After the loss of a loved one the government deems it fit to tax you on your inheritance at 40%. As the threshhold is quite often well below the value of the family home it too is lost. This is not a tax against the rich, but a tax against the working and middle class who have contributed to the economy their whole life only to be kicked again by the governement when they're down. \n\nAbolish inheritance tax before it costs you the next general election!!",
