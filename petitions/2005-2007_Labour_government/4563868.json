            "background": "Alcohol taxation should be about preventing anti-social behaviour and reducing burdens on the NHS caused by alcoholics.  But, because wine has been traditionally accepted as a middle class person's drink, wine drinkers are the least likely to commit anti-social behaviour or place burdens on the NHS.  Therefore, Wine Duties should be reduced by half.  The cost would be around \u00a31.3 billion in 2007-08 prices and is fully affordable.",
