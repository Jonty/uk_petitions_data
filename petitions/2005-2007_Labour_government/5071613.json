Access to food is minimal and arbitrary. Access to water is arbitrary. Medical care is non existent. Prison sentences are of arbitrary length. \nThe people of this country are ruled over arbitrarily. The government is oppressive and corrupt beyond that of Sadam Hussein's Iraq. \nEquatorial Guinea is just one example of massive basic Human Rights violations (there are no Human Rights in EQ).  \nWe urge our Prime Minister and our government to declare voiciferously that such despotic rule can not be allowed to continue in EQ or anywhere else in the world. We urge our government to take action with the international community against such despotism.",
