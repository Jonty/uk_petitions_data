This is said to be an incentive \n\"The EMA recognizes that some young people do not stay on in post 16 learning because of financial cost, and others struggle to the detriment of their studies. In addition, we know from participation rates that children from professional/managerial families are more likely to stay on in post 16 learning than children from unskilled, manual class families. The EMA acknowledges this and helps to remove financial barriers by incentivising young people to stay on in learning\"\nas quoted from the government.\nHowever i feel this has a net affect on those who do not meet the criteria as they do not get any financial incentive while a majority of peers get their EMA and EMA bonuses (100 pounds for every bonus)",
