        "background": "Why is it that every time i drive along any motorway in the country that have parking spots for \"police vehicles only\" I almost invariably see one of those police look a like motorway service vehicles parked up in a \"police only\" place. Don`t say its for there own safety while there having a brake, After all if i stopped for a brake there you can be 100% sure i`d end up in court. Personally i think its because those who do it like to see everyone braking when there spottered. You know the thing \"look at me I'm the all powerful one\"",
