            "background": "It is outrageous that the Government are investing millions of pounds into employing people to police the non-smoking ban in pubs and clubs. This is ridiculous. This money should be used to improve the NHS and reduce waiting lists, it could go towards tackling real crimes, it could be used to try and reduce abuse to women and children, and it could be put towards education. There is no way that there is a reasonable explanation for spending this amount of money on a useless cause. We need your help to re-instore a proper use of Tax Payers Money on benefical causes within the UK.",
