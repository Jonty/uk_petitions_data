            "background": "Mr. Blair, please ask the Americans to give us CV-11, CV-12, CV-16, and CV-59 for us so that we can sink them on the Northern Sea, to allow fish populations to grow again after Continental European fishing fleets decimated them. The USN no longer uses these ships and doesn't need them at all. We Britons though have never built a ship as big as CV-11 to sink as an artificial reef. We could only sink a small ship, like a frigate. That would not fulfill the objective well and would weaken our security as our navy is anyway smaller than the USN. Please ask the USN to tow those ships to Britain so that we sink them as artificial reefs, which is the only way to help fish populations grow.",
