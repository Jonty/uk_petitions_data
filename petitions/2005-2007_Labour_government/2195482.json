        "action": "end the current system of gift aid and replace it with a percentage agreed annually between the Treasury, The Charity Commissioners and the charities based on the charities' audited donations, allowing charity workers to perform more useful work than checking off tickboxes for gift aid on forms.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Nearly everybody who thinks of it will tick the gift aid box. Cut the bureaucracy and allow a composite rate to be applied to the charities' audited figures. The rate would be based on an assessment of how many donors nationwide pay tax: a) at Standard rate; b) at Higher Rate; c) pay no tax d) are not liable to UK tax e.g. foreign visitors. Charity workers could then concentrate on actively pursuing the aims of the charity rather than checking off forms. The money could be handed over in monthly slices, with annual adjustments.",
