            "background": "I think it would be sensible to raise the age of a partner from outside the EU marrying a British national, or a British national marrying someone outside the EU to 21 or even 25. This would primarily protect teenage women from the UK being forced to marry men outside the UK when they are still living at home and under greater influence from their families.It would also limit immigration from the developing world and also help towards the integration of ethnic minorities which is harder when one parent was brought up in a different culture. This is crucial to encourage integration.",
