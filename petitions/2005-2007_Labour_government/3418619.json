            "background": "I believe an annual contraceptive injection given to all women under the age of 21 is the most realistic long-term option to rectify many of the problems we face in our society today. What is more barbaric - abortion, a teenager with a bunch of ASBOs, or contraception?  I see this as inocculating against a social disease that is more lethal than whooping cough or measles. For those who are strongly against this, perhaps there could be an application system to opt out, under the condition that if their daughters fall pregnant or their sons commit statutory rape, they will not be eligible for state help. For those who think this would increase STDs - responsible people can still use condoms. It's obvious that many teenagers don't use them and if they cannot take responsibility for themselves, I'd prefer it if my tax went towards assisting the state in taking responsibility for them.",
