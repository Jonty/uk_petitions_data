They were siezed against Iraqi and International Law by the Iranian Revolutionary Guard and have been taken to an undisclosed locale and have not been heard of since.\n\nThe British Government should not take any measure of the table and be ready and prepared to use absolutely any means necessary to ensure the return of our forces taken hostage, the British Government both direct and indirect should be handing Tehran the most terribly blunt terms about why this situation doesn't bode well for them, considering the precarious position that the world considers them to be in.",
