        "background": "There has been much made of late where the NHS are saying that smokers or obese people should not access to certain NHS treatments. I do not think that the NHS should give drug addicts access to the NHS for treatment and methadone predsciptions for example. It was their choice to use drugs as it is others choice to smoke or eat. Smoking and eating are both also legal activities, while drug use is strictly against the law and extremely anti social. Stop these resources being used for those in society who do nothing other than continously take from it and serve little or no purpose within it. Lets support upstanding and law abiding citizens to attain better health.",
