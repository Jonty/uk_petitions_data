            "background": "Our laws affecting children and adults have been enacted over many decades and the age where one generation see when a person becomes an adult, maybe very different from another generation. We therefore have many differing laws where people of a given age are permitted to do one thing as an adult, while at the same time prohibited from doing another as a child. A law should be enacted to set one age for becoming an adult and all other laws amended to defer to this new law, where age is concerned when treating an individual differently depending upon their age. Examples could include; buying tobacco products (16), holding a driving licence (17) and buying alcohol (18).",
