            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This is to achieve three aims. First, to encourage car users to use public transport thus lessening pollution and congestion; second, to help the relative poor who cannot afford to own and run a car; third, to encourage people to get out and about more to leisure, shopping, education and other social activities that will increase their happiness. The more people that use buses the more they can be run frequently and as people get used to the buses a higher but still moderate fare can be introduced resulting in a drop in subsidy without harming the aims. There is an economic cost, which will have to be found from somewhere, but this is far outweighed by the social benefits.",
