            "background": "Anti-social behaviour and criminal activity seems to have little or no meaningful deterrent.  It is therefore time for the government to introduce a scheme whereby a first offence (however minor)leads to a one-month taster course of national service with the promise of a full two year term for any person who reoffends after the taster course.  It is the only way to bring back the courtesy and discipline we once had in this country.  This should apply to all offending persons in the 16 to 29 year old age group.  It will reduce numbers in prisons and young offenders institutes and is a better way to spend our taxes.",
