            "background": "The history of Hillsborough begins with the deaths of 96 people and the physical and mental injury of countless others. However it does not end there. The enormity of the Disaster goes beyond even this. The history of Hillsborough becomes the history of injustice, of cover-up, and collusion. We need the truth to be revealed and Chief Inspector Duckenfields role in the unfolding disaster exposed and his actions brought to justice. The bereaved and survivors of the Disaster will long be remembered for the heroic stances they took against the might of bureaucratic forces in the name of justice. Please sign this petition, not as a Liverpool fan, but for the injustice to the 96 football fans, who no longer to get to watch their beloved team, and the greaving families & friends who have to live with the injustice, the lies, the cover-ups & blame, driven through the media, of their loved ones.",
