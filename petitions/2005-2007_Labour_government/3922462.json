            "background": "A massive \u00a32m must be found within a year or the Gosport to Portsmouth ferry will be run aground for good, according to worried Gosport councillors.\n\nThey fear the town faces total gridlock unless the cash is found to fix up the decaying council-owned ferry pontoon - which is within 12 months of being declared unsafe.\n\nThe situation has become so desperate that councillors from Fareham and Gosport formed a 10-strong cross-party group to pressure Hampshire County Council to provide funds. They will meet with county bosses soon to press their case.\n\nIf the cash can't be found, it could be the end for the service which carries more than one million passengers a year.",
