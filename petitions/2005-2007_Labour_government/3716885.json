The two departments cover busy stretches of the M25 and A3.  The proposed alternative A and E depts will be at Frimly Park Hospital 13 Miles from Woking or Ashtead Hospital near Terminal 4 Heathrow 15 miles from Woking.  The practicalities of reaching these alternative Hospitals puts lives at risk in a densly populated area.",
