But it is also in a dire state because of massive unecessary cutbacks. Why is it there are supposed 'shortages' of doctors, nurses etc yet newly-qualified staff are having to move abroad or take jobs they did not spend 3 years training for (stacking shelves for example). It is a travesty that talent is being wasted like this.",
