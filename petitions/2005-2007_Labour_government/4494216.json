        "background": "Letting agents are supposed to be a transparent door between landlord & tenant but, when disputes arise, this door becomes decidedly opaque.  Two & a half million homes are rented in this country, most by decent tenants, but when the time comes to return a bond, for instance, neither the agency or the landlord is willing to part with this money, and many stressed tenants are obliged to take legal action to recover what is theirs.  The internet is overwhelmed by cases such as this - the agencies seem to emerge smelling of roses, while the tenant has all the hassle.  Letting agencies must be obliged to train their staff to a suitable standard, not to promise things they have have no intention of doing, and facilitating the prompt return of monies owed which have been paid to them, not to the landlord.  There is no logical reason why a tenant should have to sue a landlord for a bond, when it was originally paid to an agency who usually holds on to it & does not pass it on to the landlord.  Anomalies such as these must be addressed.",
