            "background": "Ever since 1973 when Britain joined the EU life became a misery. Children's quality of life began to plummet with all of the new EU Health And Safety laws. What is safety against the joy of life. Then, they had us change from inches to centimeters. Gallons became litres and miles became kilometres (which my 10 year old sun can't understand). Europe destroyed the pride and the independence of Britain. Apparently it was good for trade, but here was a quote made by James McBay: \n\"We are supposed to be booming in this country, yet the average European seems to be \"better off\" than we are. They also appear to be more organised.\" \nJames Mcbay, England\n\nDo something to turn this great nation around and back to how people could live their lives with pride and joy.",
