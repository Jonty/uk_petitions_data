Many of those exhibiting such behaviour see being given an ASBO as a rite of passage.\n\nPunishment for repeat offences of this nature should be forced conscription into \"boot camps\", where the offender will learn proper behaviour and hopefully be encouraged to act more accordingly. Further offences after this should result in hard prison time.",
