            "background": "The senior citizens of our great nation should not be charged for the care they receive from this government. Meaning care homes, nursing homes, help with dressing, food preparation, bathing, care phones etc. They have put into this government and they should be entitled to a good level of care at no cost to themselves or their families. Home owners should not be forced to sell their homes to pay for nursing or care homes, do you think that most elderly people actually like living with virtually no independence it is not a choice but a necessity. Do something and give them the care they deserve.",
