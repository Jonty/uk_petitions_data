            "background": "Drugs are too dangerous to leave in the hands of criminals. Legalisation removes the need for people to procure their drugs through the criminal fraternity, thus drying up the cash flow to the suppliers and putting them out of business.\n\nIf all drugs were legal then they could be sold through controlled licenced premisis (rather like alcohol), and the taxes that are gathered could be used for education and healthcare. \n\nThe health benefits would be huge, as a large portion of the health issues experienced by users is related to deliberatly contaminated supplies.\n\nThe war on drugs has been lost. Its time to draw up terms of surrender.\n\nWe urge the prime minister to legalise all drugs immediately, under a scheme similar to alcohol, and to use the tax revenue for education.",
