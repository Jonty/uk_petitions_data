            "background": "Many divorced parents do not live with their children and are required to pay their former partners maintenance for the kids. Yet many wish to play a full part in their children's lives, maintain a home for  them, take them on holiday, pay for music lessons etc etc. Because of this they effectively pay twice to support their kids. I think people like this should receive at least some tax relief on their payments. It might even encourage more absent parents to pay!",
