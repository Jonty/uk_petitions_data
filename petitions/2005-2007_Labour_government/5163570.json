            "background": "We are dismayed that Private water companies are permitted to make profit on charging excesively for a basic human requirement to survive.  \n\nWe recognise that they are companies and as such have a reqirement to run at a profit, however, this should not be at the expense of the captive consumer, who has no alternative source. \n\nWe demand that, like the Energy Services (Gas and Electricity Provision), Water and Sewerage provision are opened to competition to allow the consumer to make the decison about who profits from their need for water and sanitation.",
