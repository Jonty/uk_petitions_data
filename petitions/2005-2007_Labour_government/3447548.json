        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The value of carbon credit on the card can be bought and sold, like milk quotas so that poorer owners could raise money on their carbon ration by selling to those rich enough to be able to afford to travel. This is fairer than road pricing which enables the rich to continue to pollute while denying the poor the ability to travel",
