            "background": "Despite a worldwide moratorium on commercial whaling, the number of whales killed for profit has increased. The International Fund for Animal Welfare estimates that Japan has killed 200 minke whales in the North Pacific, with almost 400 destroyed in the Southern Ocean Sanctuary.\n\nLast June at the IWC meeting, the pro-whaling nations secured a majority and are now attempting to lift the twenty year ban on whaling. In the year before last year's meeting there were no ministerial level discussions between the Environment Secretary and Foreign Secretary and no ministerial level discussions with foreign governments. Bexley CF believe that the Government must make a stronger effort this year to prevent the same happening again. The Government's Protecting Whales \u2013 A Global Responsibility document is an important step forward but it must be followed up with effective diplomacy if we are to save the planet's whales.",
