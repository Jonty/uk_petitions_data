Since that time the local council has destroyed what remained & left the pier head to rot out at sea. At 3,787ft (1147m) Herne Bay pier was the second longest pier in the country, being eclipsed only by Southend-on-Sea.\nThe history of the pier can be found at hernebaypier.com\nThe people of Herne Bay and Kent want their pier re-instated.",
