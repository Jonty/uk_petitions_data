        "action": "require the Minister for Health to direct the removal of the excess cost of ringing into hospital bedsides where Patientline have installed telephone numbers starting 070 which are premium rate numbers and to remove the additional cost of dialing out from the hospital bedside when patients need to use the telephone.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Often the only contact with outside of the hospital for a long term patient will be a telephone and the additional costs of telephone calls over the normal telephone rates are often the cause for great distress. This can also apply to short term patients of low income. Many patients can not afford to make a phone call on the Patientline phone systems. A happy patient can recover quicker and therefore be less of a cost on the hospital budget.",
