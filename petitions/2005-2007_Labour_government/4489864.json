        "background": "With seven times as much being spent on women's health as men's health, and most practices being open only when men are most likely to be at work. According to Dr Love, joint chairman of the British Medical Association's GPs committee, 'Up to 100 per cent of breast-cancer patients start treatment within two months, but for urological cancers, achievement of the target falls to a low of 54.5 per cent.' showing that the NHS is bowing to pressure groups in who to treat, and other areas are losing out as a result. Clearly the NHS is capable of treating all with common breast cancer within 2 months, yet it is mostly men who miss out since the almost equally common prostate cancer has around a 4 times greater mortality rate (cancer research UK).\n\nThe health service in this country is letting down men in the regions of both diagnosis and treatment, which should be improved to match that of women. Life expectancy differences are decreasing, but at this rate (0.4 years every 2 to 3 years), it will be decades until the gap is closed",
