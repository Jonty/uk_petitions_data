            "background": "Recent reports over the news claim that prisons are over flowing with criminals. We now have in England & Wales alone over 80,658 & the numbers are increasing fast. The goverment put people in prison for relatively low level offences, if we can do this why cant we give the death sentence to those who take others lives and commit high levels of crime. For example Huntly does not deserve the right to live after taking two young girls lives. Its obvious those sort of people dont want to live because they try to commit suicide anyway. It wont prevent people from murdering but its should give the victims family and society knowledge that justice has been done.",
