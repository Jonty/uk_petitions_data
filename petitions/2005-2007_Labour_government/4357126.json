            "background": "The policing of our rural villages is given an extremely low priority. In fact there is no day to day policing and yet we have underage drinking,antisocial behavior all going on from early evening to very late at night usually in childrens play areas after dark.\n\nThe problems do not require a 999 call but calling the local police ( stationed 9 miles away)when and if they arrive we have had the response of \" the  community should get together and sort the problem\". If we were to \"sort it\" we run the risk of prosecution.Besides,what on earth do we pay our rates for if not for having a police presence. Our Police Force costs in Cherwell are the same as we pay Cherwell District Council for all of their services which many and diverse. \n\nRural comunities are left to get on with it whilst there are bigger policing problems in our towns and cities. VILLAGES HAVE A RIGHT TO THE SAME CARE AND PROTECTION",
