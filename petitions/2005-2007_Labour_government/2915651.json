            "background": "East Sussex County Council propose to increase parking restrictions and charges in Seaford against the wishes of the residents and business people in the town.\nThe charges they are trying to impose are not fair or reasonable because people will not pay but merely go elsewhere to shop.  Also there are few enough visitors to the beach and seaside without driving them away by these charges.\n\nI feel what the County Council is trying to do is really undemocratic and that they are just not listening to local people.  The charges will affect not only local people but visitors as well.",
