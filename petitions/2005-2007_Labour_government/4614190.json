        "background": "Inheritance tax exists to level out the inequalities that allowed a small group in society to pass on disproportionate advantages over successive generations creating self propagating fortunes that denied resources and opportunity to the majority regardless of their ability or need.\n\nWealth generated by the appreciation of assets, including property, is not \"earned\"  and should be taxed like any other capital gain. To pay income tax on the wages that paid a \u00a350,000 mortgage is not to pay tax on the \u00a3200,000 the same house may now sell for.\n\nIt is not appropriate to tax the dead as they cannot enjoy any wealth that they leave. Inheritance tax should be levied against their beneficiaries according to their financial status.\n\nThere is no  social worth in allowing a millionaire to inherit a \u00a3250,000 house tax free. Similarly for 4 children to share an inheritance of a million pounds is as valid as an only child inheriting a \u00a3250,000 estate alone.\n\nChange inheritance tax to make it fairer, not to support a new idle rich.",
