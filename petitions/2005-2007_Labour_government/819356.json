            "background": "Why Ban Pornography?\n\n1) It affects every viewer negatively, regardless of creed, gender or age, and leads to progressive addiction & compulsive behavioural problems which can ruin the lives of sufferers & families.\n\n2)  It feeds lust & leaves viewers craving more & more to achieve same highs.  It enslaves people to their cravings & opens door to anger, abuse, violence, hatred, lying, envy, compulsiveness & selfishness. \n\n3)  It sexualizes viewer's mindset & warps/perverts their perspective so sex is unnaturally elevated in their mind.  Porn is stamped into a viewer's brain with the aid of hormones released during arousal, so even if one stops looking at porn, past images can remain for years or a lifetime. \n\n4)  Looking at porn can damage family relationships, & increases chance of children finding the material.  It can also cause sexual frustration, lying, affairs, debt, violence & irrational thinking, which all affect the sufferer\u2019s family.",
