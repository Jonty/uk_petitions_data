            "background": "It is clearly and commonly publicised for Unemployed people to be entitled to receive discounts in all services, such as Entertainment and Health. Disabled Claimants should have precedence of recognition on forms eg, back of prescription, because they have been certified unfit to work. Questions are asked by services about unevident disabities therefore having to go under the auspices of being unemployed. We ask that this is changed to allow Disabled People to have discounts in services without disguising their disablity and 'ticking the right box' marked for them",
