            "background": "For many people living or working outside of major cities a car is a requirement to even get a job or go shopping and is very far away from being a luxury.\n\nTry working shifts which start before or end after the buses, (which run once once or twice an hour on a good day) actually start running. So your only public transport option is a taxi which costs you as much as you earn in 5 hours, then the taxman takes the other 3 hours so you end up working for nothing.\n\nEven for the half of the journey you can catch a bus the difference is 15 minutes drive or a 2 hour bus journey with 2 or 3 changes.\n\nSo please educate these people (many of whom seem to be involved in the government policy making machine) who are so set on discriminating against motorists that whilst they may personally have other options, not everyone has. so they should stop trying to bleed motorists dry just to either make themselves feel better, grab headlines or pander to the green vote",
