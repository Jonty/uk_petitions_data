        "background": "Have YOU ever seen a bird prison? The chances are probably yes. By an unfortunate design flaw, some \"bird houses\" / \"bird feeders\" are actually bird prisons. For example, some have one-way swing doors, so a bird will fly in, but then has no way out. We are calling for a stricter control on the \"bird houses\" that are produced and sold and also for there to be some kind of regulation on them, to try and eliminate the problem of bird prisons.",
