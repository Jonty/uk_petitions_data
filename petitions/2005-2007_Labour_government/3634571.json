        "background": "Put an end to BskyB\u2019s longstanding ability to openly abuse loopholes in UK Corporation tax law that appear to allow it to develop a financial structure with a labyrinth of holding companies, many in offshore tax havens, so that to date it has been able to completely avoid Corporation tax. This not only denies the British Public of a considerable amount of fair and proper tax contribution to our National purse, but also allows BskyB to fund aggressive tactics against it's commercial rivals and corrupt British democracy with a history of large and inappropriate donations to UK political parties.",
