            "background": "Knowing that there are quite a few petitions about the A14, I want to suggest an alternative to widening the A14 from Cambridge to Huntingdon.  Extend the A428 dual carriageway from the Caxton Gibet (A1198) to south of Huntingdon and join the A1.  This could then take the A14 traffic at Cambridge while the M11 traffic could continue on the old A14 staight to the A1.  This would stop the horrendous traffic jams at Barr Hill where both roads converge.",
