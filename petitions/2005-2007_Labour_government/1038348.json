        "background": "Cornwall has been and remains to all intents and purposes a part of England. Several unelected, and unrepresentative bodies, have taken it on themselves to put forward the notion that Cornwall is a separate entity within the UK. This is patently false. As Cornwall is one of the poorest areas of the UK and relies heavily on government subsidy and Objective one money, no further strain should be put on the economy by \"devolving\" the county's governance, until a disciplined and monitored referendum has been put to the electorate.\n\nIf people like the \u201cStannary Parliament\u201d, who are nothing more than a bunch of self-elected busy-bodies, wish to have influence in the politics of the county they should put themselves forwards for election as Mebyon Kernow do, and not try to short circuit the processes of our democracy.",
