        "background": "To bring back the Genesis calendar story with its visual illustrations and descriptions of \"creation\" in school lessons, so as to improve the mind and thoughts of very young children towards their parents, brothers and sisters, family, friends, creatures, environment and world as they grow up. This can be done by using the Genesis image and story as a guide to improve their observation, perception, knowledge, and understanding in a more balanced fashion using religion and science working in harmony, so forming a better sense of awe, beauty, wonder and amazement \"within\" each child as they grow up for all living things created around them, rather than the self centred materialistic way and destructive path example at present being taught.",
