            "background": "Cheshire has relatively few Youth centres left. Those that remain are in danger of being transferred or sold off to save money. I am sure this is the case in other parts of the Country, is it any wonder our youth are disillusioned, hang around street corners and get into trouble with drink and drugs. Social interaction is just as important in the development of our youth as training for work.\nWell used Youth centres in Cheshire are being closed or sold off at an alarming rate this must stop. The Government must take steps to ensure all authorities fully fund youth centres and where needed open new ones where the community identify the need.",
