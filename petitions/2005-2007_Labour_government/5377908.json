            "background": "the c.s.a should not discriminate against self employed absent fathers by letting them get away without paying TOWARDS (not FOR) their childrens upbringing. Remember the mother still pays more in the longrun, we only ask for HELP. My son has been refused the \u00a330 weekly payment whilst at college because his step-father earns over \u00a330,000-even though his birth father pays us nothing. Why do they assume the 'new' partner takes 100% financial responsibility. are we being penalised because my 2nd husband happens to earn well at the moment, even though he hes provided us all with a larger house to accomodate my children from a previous marriage. does the fact that i found happiness with another man mean my children dont deserve anything from their real father? had I still been alone would they have made more effort to force him to pay because then i would have help from the state towards my income.this is not acceptable. absent .fathers need to live up to their responsibilities",
