        "background": "There is a tradition of naming bridges after royalty.  Edinburgh has the George IV Bridge and Sunderland the Victoria Viaduct.  In Wessex, Brunel\u2019s Great Western Railway leads to the Royal Albert Bridge across the Tamar.\n\nNames add a touch of colour to otherwise drab, functional objects.  At present, opportunities are being lost to liven up our lives and put places more firmly on the map.\n\nHalf the Severn Estuary is in Wales and half in Wessex.  The proposal would acknowledge this, naming one bridge after each.  The first bridge would be named after the firstborn, who, as it happens, lives in Gloucestershire.  The second bridge is bigger, just as Wessex is bigger than Wales, and links Prince Edward\u2019s earldom with his wife\u2019s ancestral land.  As well as being Earl of Wessex, the prince is also Viscount Severn, so what could be more appropriate than to add his name to the bridge crossing that river?",
