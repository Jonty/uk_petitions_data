            "background": "Cannock Stadium is home to the Cannock and Stafford Athletics clubs, one of the countries successfull clubs in both the Junior and Young athletes league. Over the last 10 Years the club has had representatives in the English Schools competition, has competed in the Auxillary final and the Young Athletes final.\nThe local council are selling the land to enable the development of more houses in an already overcrowded, built up area. We as a club wish to have our stadium left alone to enable the children, some who could represent the country in the 2012 Olympics, to develop into the promising athletes that they are. We have a team dedicated coaches who have given many years to the club. The Government wants to promote healthy children yet it allows its councils to take away there facilities.\n Mr Blair, if you want to do one thing right before you finish your term then stop this closure and allow our athletes the opportunity to develop and to possibly reach the 2012 Olympics.",
