            "background": "Religious observance in schools is divisive, especially when the obligation is exclusively to the Christian faith.\n\nThe link between state education and religious observance should be removed completely allowing atheists and those of other faiths to participate in school life on an equal basis.\n\nAllowing an individual to \"opt out\" is not sufficient as this categorises and potentially stigmatises children. \n\nFurthermore in rural areas often ONLY faith schools are available locally. This discriminates against non-religious children and teachers (who often can't be employed without religious hypocrisy)  and those of other faiths.",
