        "background": "The purpose of this petition is two-fold. Firstly, to reduce congestion on the roads during the morning rush-hour, and secondarily to make the roads safer.\n\nAt present, more cyclists are killed on the roads by lorries in the morning rush hour than any other way. By removing them from the roads at this time it will immediately reduce the number of deaths and encourage more the use of cycling to work.\n\nIt will also create more road-space. Although many will fear this will just lead to increased car-use, other measures can be taken, eg providing more bus services (possibly even driven by joint HGV/PSV licence holders) or by high-occupancy lanes. \n\nFor some, for whom a car journey is essential, the roads will be less congested for them.",
