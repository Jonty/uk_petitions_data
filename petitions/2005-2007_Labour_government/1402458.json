        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "With the opening of the new Eurostar terminal at Kings Cross, it has been proposed that the Waterloo terminal be closed. This will disenfranchise the huge population that do not live north of the river Thames.\n\nThe site of the new terminal is much further away from the centre of London. This move will inconvenience foreign traveller entering London and damage the economy.\n\nEurostar say that the journey time will reduce by 20 minutes from the new terminal, however getting from Waterloo to Kings Cross will take well over 20 minutes.\n\nThe extra journey will make the Eurostar inaccessible on a practical level as it will involve either:\na)  an expensive cab journey adding about \u00a350 each way.\nb)  a ridiculously long bus journey involving at least one change.\nc)  a journey through the underground system with large amounts of luggage and any children.\n\nAlso, with the push toward carbon emission reduction, we as a country should be increasing our international train journeys not reducing them.",
