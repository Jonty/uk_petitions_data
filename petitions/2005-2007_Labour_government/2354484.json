            "background": "Currently the Road Fund Licence 'rewards' owners of vehicles with low emissions and/or are converted to run on greener fuels such as LPG ONLY if such vehicles are less than 5 years old. This penalises conscientious owners of older vehicles who will, likely, already have spent a not inconsiderable sum converting to greener fuel. Surely such vehicles should be recognised within the road taxation system for considerably reducing the pollution that older vehicles could be emitting. My 14yr old, rurally owned and driven gas-guzzling 4x4 runs on LPG and emits H2O and yet I am obliged to pay at the HIGHEST rate of Road Fund Licence just the same as many other environmentally aware folk and there are no grants for conversion.",
