            "background": "The Commonwealth has no  relevance to modern Britons.  It is a drain on taxpayers' money and acts as a \"third world\" pressure group to enduce British governments to act against the national interest. Countries such as Australia now (rightly) recruit citizens with no traditional links with UK. Others, such as Zimbawe or Pakistan, have nothing in common with the UK. Britain would be better served if such countries were treated like any other foreign state - friends and partners if it suits both parties. (As we said at school- pass this on).",
