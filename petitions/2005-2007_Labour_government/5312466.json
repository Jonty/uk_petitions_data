During this time, Japanese fishermen are responsible for the killing of the largest number of dolphins anywhere in the world. These hunts are sustained by marine parks which pay large amounts of money for live dolphins to re-stock their facilities.",

Their bodies are then hauled to a makeshift slaughter area for butchering into food for human consumption or pet food.  \nThese hunts may last days,during which these complex and intelligent creatures will be trapped and stressed while being able to hear their counterparts being slaughtered. \nThose dolphins which are not killed will have been chosen by marine parks or aquaria,destined for an impoverished and restricted life in captivity.",
