            "background": "We call for Ofsted to be compelled to follow the standard empirical rules of observation, when inspecting colleges and schools in England and Wales. No Inspection of any college or school in the past five years has been done using standard empirical rules of observation. As a result ALL inspections in England and Wales during this period are null and void. The reason is that Inspectors are given sensitive statistical information about the places that they are about to inspect, which by its very nature will bias the inspection. Under the standard rules of empirical observation all observation must be done cold. Only after the inspections have taken place can the statistical information be given to the inspector regarding the past performance of the educational establishment. Preconceived information will always influence observation. Ofsted appear not to know this.",
