        "background": "On the 12th of June, 2007, during his 'farewell tour', Tony Blair made a speech which complained about the British media. While he acknowledged that New Labour had played it's part in this he singles out The Independent newspaper for criticism, his reasons are not made explicit but it can safely be assumed that it is mainly for it's opposition to the War in Iraq and the actions of his Government in the War Against Terror.\n\nWhether the Wars are right or wrong, it is not appropriate for a political figure to try to settle scores while still standing on the political stage and should save it for after he steps down.",
