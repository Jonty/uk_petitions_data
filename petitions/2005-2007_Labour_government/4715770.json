If it is true that the people we trust to look after us can abuse the system to manipulate and benefit the political stance of the party they belong to then the public ought to be allowed a view on anything they do.  If there is no truth in the matter then the Prime Minister can have no hesitation in issuing an order which stops such dishonourable activity it it's tracks?",
