            "background": "It seems that in the UK we have to pay more than everyone else to buy the same things that people buy in other countries.  Some recent examples of this would be the sale of Windows Vista, the Xbox 360, and (when it eventually goes on sale) the Playstation 3.  I propose that the government should introduce laws to force international corporations to charge UK citizens a fair price where the product being sold is the same (or inferior to in the case of the PS3) in different countries.",
