        "background": "Three years ago the Prime Minister said: \u201cYou cannot have a situation where you get a rejection of the treaty and bring it back with a few amendments and say, \u2018Have another go\u2019.\u201d \n\nBut this is exactly what is happening today. The proposals give more power to the EU, including control of our criminal justice system. This alters Britain's relationship with the EU. \n\nTherefore we call on the Prime Minister to honour his original promise to allow a referendum to decide if Britain should ratify the elements contained in the treaty.",
