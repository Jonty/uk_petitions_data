But what about the uncles??\n\nWhere is our day? \n\nAre we no less important? \n\nDo we not support, love and honour our kin the same? \n\nShould we not get our reward for buying mulitple presents for our brothers and sisters families and only get one in return??\n\nI put it to you, the masses of Uncles to pledge your support to grant our cause the audience and reward it deserves!!!\n\nWe fight for our freedom, we fight for our honour. For we don't just fight for our Uncle Day, we fight our justice!! For this is our, Secondary Carer Day!!!\n\nAunties can have one too, but they should start their own!! It is the Noughties after all!!",
