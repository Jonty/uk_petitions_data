            "background": "Leeds United FC is the only League status football club in the city of Leeds.  It has placed the city on the map and attracts visitors to the city from the UK and overseas.  \n\nLeeds City Council has received a windfall of \u00a360m from the sale of Leeds Bradford International Airport.  The single biggest project that suddenly becomes possible would be to purchase Leeds United FC and provide it with the necessary investment to rebuild the club.  \n\nLeeds United has suffered financial decline with a succession of private owners who have been unable to provide sufficient funding to allow the club to remain competitive against other football clubs funded from overseas sources.  \n\nSuch a move would provide a model of local ownership, encouraging the development of local youth talent and would find favour with a significant proportion of the residents of Leeds.  It would ensure that a regional icon would remain in British hands, unlike Manchester United, Chelsea and Liverpool FC amongst others.",
