            "background": "Over half of university students currently work part-time, but few of them work in jobs that relate to their academic course.  The Government should introduce a scheme whereby students can gain useful work experience that corresponds to their academic studies.  Specifically, the Government could subsidise employers who create such jobs by a fixed percentage of the wage, say 20 per cent.  This would help employers by increasing competition amongst graduates and would help graduates by preparing them for working in the commercial world.",
