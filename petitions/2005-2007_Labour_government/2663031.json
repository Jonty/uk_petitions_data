            "background": "I wish that government introduces a complete ban on the manufacture, sales, distribution and use of all weapons except water pistols with the following caveats on use:\n\n1. They must not be any more powerful than a super soaker 3000.\n\n2. They may only contain water.\n\n3. The water must not be above ambient temperature or cold enough to give goose pimples\n\n4. The use of water containing fluoride or chlorine should also be prohibited.\n\nFinally this should be enacted in the UK as well as taken to the EU and the United Nations for world wide adoption.",
