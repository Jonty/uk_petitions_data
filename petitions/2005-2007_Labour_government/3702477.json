            "background": "The Government is committed to Digital TV and have set dates to \"turn off\" analogue. So shouldn't they be taking a big interest in the childish dispute between Sky and Virgin Media that has affected thousands of people throughout the UK? This silly dispute is not only seriously damaging people's confidence in digital TV, but  - perhaps more importantly - is all set to move Sky further to becoming a monopoly business. So, should the Monopolies Commission be looking at it as well?",
