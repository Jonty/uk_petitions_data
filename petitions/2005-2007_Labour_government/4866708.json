        "background": "Although I think that epetitions are an excellent idea, I have several concerns about the way petitions are vetted.\n\nVery poorly worded petitions are allowed. Some are just one liners with no valid explanation about why you should support it. This means that a much clearer worded petition is disallowed because it is a duplicate, with no recourse to discussion. Why not reject petitions that do not clearly state why they should be supported, giving the requester an opportunity to improve his wording.\n\nSeveral petitions have multiple requests. You may not agree with all the requests, but then you can't put in a petition for one of them because it will then be rejected as a duplicate! Why not either reject petitions with duplicate requests or (better) allow petitions that only duplicate one request.",
