        "background": "I believe after visiting Hiroshima and/or Nagasaki, that Mr Blair, and/or his replacement, and his peers from other Nuclear states should witness firsthand the devastation and destruction that a nuclear weapon can cause.\n\nIn requesting this, I hope that they will know, and bear on their conscience, the true weight of nuclear proliferation and remember the horrific injuries that they can cause to those alive, and those unborn in proximity to the area of destruction.\n\nThe idea that he has not visited while having these weapons of mass destruction under his control, is frankly appalling. Whether he then concedes and does not replace them, or whether he still chooses to persist in maintaining these weapons, hopefully the imagery will be retained in his living memory regardless.",
