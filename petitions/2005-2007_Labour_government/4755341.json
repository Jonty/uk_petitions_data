In fact they are only reviewing from commercial software suppliers and the idea of looking in\nto Open Source software doesn't even gets a look in.\nBy doing this they are inveterately wasting public money, which could be put to a better use and spent on supply services to the general public.  \nAlso there is serious risk that at a future date we might not be able to access these files as support for these\nfiles formats could be revoked at any time in the future by the commercial suppliers. By using commercial software which is using undocumented file formats\nit would render the nations history unassailable by future people of our nation.",
