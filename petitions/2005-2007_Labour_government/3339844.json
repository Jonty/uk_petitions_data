        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This would avoid the current confusion over exactly how much one can drink and stay under the limit; human nature being what it is inevitably people will have just one more drink, in the hope that they are still under the limit when in fact this drink brings them over it and therefore more likely to cause an accident which may be FATAL!  There is also the fact that everyone is an individual and reacts in an individual way to the same amount of alcohol; and of course each individual's body size is a similar factor.  There is no reason not to do this; several countries have already done it.  The perceived \"freedom\" to drink and then drive should be completely superseded by the right of innocent pedestrians, and other road users, not to risk being injured or even killed in an accident caused by other people's selfishness!",
