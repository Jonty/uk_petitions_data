            "background": "The EU imports 50% of the Soya from Brazil, which is grown on land that was rain forest. The UK and EEC are huge importers of tropical hardwood from around the world often as finished products fenced through intermediate countries especially China who allow import of illegal timber. Without demand the pressure to destroy these forests may reduce.\nThe destruction of tropical rain forest is genocide of a huge percentage of life on earth, what will history think of your inaction Mr Blair once all this life is gone (along with the hardwood...........).",
