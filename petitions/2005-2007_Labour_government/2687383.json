            "background": "Most Student Nurses are currently expected to live off between \u00a3500 and \u00a3600 per month. Over the three year course this forces many to quit the course, and means increasing debt for many others. \nStudent nurses work hard and spend many hours performing work for the NHS which they are not paid for. I propose that the current system of financial support is scrapped, and is replaced by a pay system that does not force student nurses to live in relative or absolute poverty.",
