Therefore I challenge the current people in charge to take note of what people want on immigration, housing, human rights,  proposed pay as you go road travel, benefits, MP's right to anonymity and foreign affairs. For too long now the working men and women of this (once great) nation have been bludgeoned into a faceless police state. We do not want ID cards, biometric data, black boxes in cars, CCTV everywhere. Give us back our freedom!",
