            "background": "If you ask your adverge brit if he's noticed global warming he'll say yes you can certianly notice a change.\nIf you ask that same question to someone in the Congo he'll say \"your kidding aren't you\".\nQuite frankly if you really want to deal with global warming you simply must deal with a Hottest area first policy. Unfortunitly these areas aren't always highlited for their importance nor for the levels of ecological abuse that goes on there instead the news is more rapped up in the starvation of poorly resourced areas like zambabwee to show you just how much of a bad man mongabee is and how he should not have got rid of the wonderful people he did just to make his country black.\nThis is all fine and well and shows the divide and conqure tactics from both sides and that wonderful lack of good self population management that makes us the most destructive force this world's ever seen from life. Might i point out though !you could be dead if we don't protect and allow the ecology around the equator to grow properly and so far the score sheet is bidismal.",
