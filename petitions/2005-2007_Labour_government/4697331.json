            "background": "The reason the gap between rich and poor constantly widens is because banks calculate interest over time. In practise the rich get interest for their savings and the poor have to pay interest for their borrowings. Because interest is charged/awarded again and again on a 'date running' basis, the rich accumulate considerable additional wealth through interest payments whilst poor never get out of debt because they are being charged again and again for interest on outstanding loans. An investigation needs to be conducted to ascertain that this practise in fact creates inflation as it increases the capital for the rich just like printing extra money. This accounting practise creates an artificial economy, which is purely calendared and date induced. It seriously threatens economic development for poorer citizens and countries and always favours the already rich. Higher interest rates do not counter but increase the problems created by this inflationary policy.",
