            "background": "The practise of piercing the ears of babies should be made illegal and the establishment carrying out this act should be prosecuted. At this age the babies have no say, and have no concept of why this is done to them. They are purely \"fashion accessories\" for those parents who think earrings on babies \"look cute\". The piercing of ears in babies causes them pain, and leaves them open to infections, and causes scarring. Please consider this act a form of child abuse.",
