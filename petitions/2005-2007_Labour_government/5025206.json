        "background": "At the last election the electorate were assured by the Prime Minister, Cabinet and all of the Labour Party that Tony Blair would remain in office (if elected) for the duration of what has become the current parliament. I would contend that a majority of the British electorate do not want Gordon Brown as Prime Minister. If Brown becomes Prime Minister under the present arrangements then democracy is dead in this country. If we truly have a free and fair democratic system let the people decide, call a general election now. As a believer in the democratic process established over hundreds of years even Gordon Brown should support this petition.",
