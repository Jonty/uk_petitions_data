Any vehicles owned by the individual would be sold and all monies put into a national fund that would be used to help victims and their families. If the amount is less than \u00a310,000 then the individual\u2019s savings and/or property can be taken to the value, if this is still insufficient, then any money they earn after leaving prison would be docked by 25% until the debt is paid. The driver would also receive permanent loss of all driving licenses, they will never be allowed to own any motorized vehicle again and their I.D. would be published nationally.",
