            "background": "Council tax levels are currently excessive and already include a percentage for rubbish collection, to impose a further taxation would be grossly unfair.\n Householders should be encouraged to recycle by the provision of a kerbside collection service for all recyclable materials and not penalised if they don't. Current kerbside collection services are poor and vary from district to district with no common standards. Local authorities often only meeting the Goverment's minimum targets.\n Taxing householders who do not recycle will lead to a rapid growth in fly tipping as seen when landfill tax was first introduced and local councils imposed restrictions to reduce their taxes.  Paper, cardboard, glass, tins and plastic can all be easily separated by householders, provide us with a collection service and I'm convinced the majority will recycle. It works in France so please give it a try here before considering yet further taxes which the vast majority of the electorate are getting tired of.",
