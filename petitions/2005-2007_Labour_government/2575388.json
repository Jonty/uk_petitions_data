        "background": "The previous government introduced a free road tax for vehicles over twenty five years of age. This was welcomed by all classic car enthusiasts, as mostly our cars travel nowhere near the distances as every day transport.Why should we pay a full road tax, when very often these cars only venture out on sunny days etc??? In fact the government could even reduce the age to twenty years old!!!!",
