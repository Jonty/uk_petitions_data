I believe it is against the principles of democracy that a Prime Minister be placed into office solely by the membership of a political party, which does not neccessarily constitute the majority of voting public. Therefore for someone such as Gordon Brown to be made Prime Minister without winning a general election not only undermines democracy in this Country, but also undermines his abaility to act as Prime Minister as he does not have a Mandate from the citizens of this country.",
