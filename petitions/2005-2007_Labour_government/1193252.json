These include: enhanced facilities for players and supporters, a wider support base and a final solution to the ongoing search for a new ground for Luton Town FC. The combined club would benefit from economies of scale, a wider 'catchment' area, and greater commercial presence in Milton Keynes, one of the fastest growing conurbations in the UK.",
