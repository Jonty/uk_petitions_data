            "background": "Child support payments are flawed.  They take no account of outgoings of the 'non resident' parent and no account of the income of the resident parent.  This is disproportionately unfair to those on very low incomes who have the same basic outgoings and needs as everyone else  (housing, heating, food, etc.\n\nA non-resident parent on the minimum wage could easily be asked to pay \u00a3200 per month for his/her children, while the resident parent could be a millionaire.  This is not in the best interests of the child as the non-resident parent is then prevented from taking a full part in the child's life.\n\nI propose that where a resident parent is earning over a threshold the matter should only be decided by a court of law and all calculations should be approved by a court of law.",
