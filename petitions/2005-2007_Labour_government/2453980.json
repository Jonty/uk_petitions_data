            "background": "The Bill of Rights gave British subjects the right to bear arms.  One of the first actions of any totalitarian government is to disarm its citizens.  Until 1922 anyone in Britain could own a handgun without any form of licence or restricton.\n\nSuccessive governments have increased restrictions on gun ownership on the pretext that it would reduce crime and the anti gun lobby, following the tragedy at Dunblane, whipped up sufficient hysteria to enable what many believe to be the most corrupt government since Walpole to totally ban the ownership of handguns.\n\nAs shooters predicted, this has not led to the decrease in guncrime but to a massive increase.  Gun crime is lowest in those parts of the world where legal private gun ownership is highest.  No criminal is going to threaten someone with a gun if there is a chance his chosen victim may be armed.\n\nHandgun owners were, as a class the most honest and law abiding section of the community.",
