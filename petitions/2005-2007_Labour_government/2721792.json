        "background": "I recently purchased a new car and after 1 week I was edging out of a petrol staition doing around 5mph  and a man came down the path on his bike (fast)he did not slow down or stop when he came to the exit. He went straight into my car and ran away even though he was injured, I shouted him to stop and he would not. I reported it to the police and they told me that most of these cases they flee because they have no way of paying for the damage. Thanks to that man I have 3 dents on the bonnet, 1 dent, 2 scratches on the side, non repairable damage, 1 dent and scratches on the bumper. I have 2 options claim on my insurance were the excess is \u00a3450 and premiums will go up or pay for the damage myself which is estimated at \u00a3700-\u00a38oo.",
