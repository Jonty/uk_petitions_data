        "action": "allow Child Tax Credit to be deducted as a tax allowance again",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Children's tax credit replaced the Married Person's tax allowance and ran as a deduction from personal income tax for two years until the tax year 2002-2003. It was then transferred to the Tax Credit system where it had to be claimed. Considering the administrative problems that have beset the new Tax Credit system, and the number of people who have inadvertently been overpaid and now have to repay Tax Credit amounts, would it be possible to allow those who so wish to have the Children's tax credit restored as a tax allowance which is simply deducted from the amount of personal income tax they have to pay. This might not suit everyone, but would avoid those not entitled to Working Tax Credit but who do work and have children to support from clogging up the Tax Credit system.",
