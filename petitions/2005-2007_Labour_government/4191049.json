            "background": "Owning a cherished vehicle, particularly European made Jaguar, Rolls Royce and Bentley, BMW and Mercedes is now taxed highly due to the engine size. Many of these vehicles are now used for special occasions only and cover low mileages as smaller vehicles, motor-bikes and public transport are instead used daily. Such vehicles are not polluters as they cover less than 3500 miles per year, verified by the MOT certificates.\n\nAs minimal polluters, these vehicles should not be taxed to the same extent as those used for chauffeur drive and daily commutes.\n\nThe increased tax levels will result in cherished vehicles being scrapped, this process in itself is a polluter.\n\nSuggestion of a road tax level of \u00a3100 for cars covering less than 3500 miles per year.",
