        "background": "In order to prevent all the thousands of hospital attendances and admissions every single night of the week that are alcohol related (either caused to or by someone who has been drinking, through accidents, violence, deliberate hooliganism, drink driving etc) and to prevent the crime sprees and induced fear, Ban drinking of all alcoholic drinks in any public place, including but not limited to pubs, clubs, bars, restaurants, buses, trains, planes, taxis, public streets, offices, shops and make it an offence punishable by instant fine of not less than \u00a3100 to be seen drinking in any of these places. \n\nConsider most town centres during kicking out time and casualty departments in the evening / early morning.\n\nAlcohol does far more damage to far more people that smoking and smoking is being banned in these places, why should we accept the crime and fear that alcohol produces but smoking does not.\n\nIf you feel this is silly, then consider why we are doing it with smoking.",
