If ANY one else drove like this they would be banned for a very long time! The police are not an exeption, therefore they must pay any penalty they aquire during their duty any suffer any bans they might have judged against them in court. There can be NO exeptions. Also even if they are running with their blue lights and sirens going as people have died due to poor police driving.",
