I received a email telling me that automated speed detection is very good supported by some bogus statistics saying Road Traffic Officers had increase from 2003 to 2005. These two years where probably chosen because over every other period the number of RTO fell. This site should allow users to opt out from these emails. The government does not always know best. It serves the people and not vice versa.",
