            "background": "Under current proposals Government Inspectors will have the right to enter any property in order to carry out assessments to assist with Council Tax re-evaluation.\nThis will result in those taking greater pride in the interior and exterior of their properties being charged greater rates of tax than their less-house-proud neighbours, for receiving the same local services.\nIn addition to this intrusion into private life, the data collect will be stored on a Whitehall computer, providing the Government with in-depth data on every house in the country.\nThis whole proposal will have the net result of generating slums, with people less inclined to improve their homes for fear of increased taxation, and further alienate the people of this country from the Government which it elected.",
