This should be extended to pedestrians - who can cause road accidents to themselves and innocent motorists.   Until the RESPONSIBILITY of remaining in a sober state in public places is linked with this FREEDOM to drink, problems will exist.  These cause extreme strains on the NHS and police who have to work extremely unsociable hours - costing taxpayers millions - to accomodate this unsocial behaviour.",
