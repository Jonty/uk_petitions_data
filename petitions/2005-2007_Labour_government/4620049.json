            "background": "The closure of the middle schools in Northumberland will not improve the education of children in the county. In Cramlington for instance the high school, which is already one of the largest in the country, will have at least 2500 pupils. The residents of the county have made clear their feelings and all the consultations conducted had the same result of at least 65% against the proposal, despite this the county council have forged ahead with the plans.",
