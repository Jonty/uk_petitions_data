            "background": "The Govenrment's failure to protect its own Freedom of Information Act from being seriously diluted by this Private Members Bill which seeks to protect the personal interests of MPs is a digrace. It confirms the public's cynicism in politics and will re-enforce their reasons not to participate at election time. The figleaf reason given that disclosure under FOI could compromise the identity of constituents is a nonsense to anyone with even a rudimentary grasp of data protection and freedom of information law.  Even in the highly unlikely possiblity that such a breach could occur, why should the exemption then not be extended to local councillors dealing with their constituents?",
