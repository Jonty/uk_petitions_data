        "background": "Successive governments have failed to spend money protecting our land, especially the East Anglian coast. As they have reneged on their obligations, the government should give planning permission to land they don't want to protect. Such areas would be protected at the developer's cost and the 50-100 metres between the sea wall and any new buildings (expensive homes with seaviews!) would be amenity land, a strip of green with car parks 1000 metres apart. A far better idea than 'giving up'.",
