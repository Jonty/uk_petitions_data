        "action": "Publish accurate facts and figures relating to lost revenue through benefit fraud by single mothers in Britain and introduce a significant 'cash reward scheme' to encourage people to 'shop' someone co-habiting without declaring it.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "On almost every street in Britain you will find several single mothers who openly and deliberately exploit the system by having a male partner live with them while declaring themselves as 'single'This results in a huge loss of revenue both directly and also due to the men that co-habit as they do not pay council tax. \nDespite government campaigns to assure us that the issue of fraud is being tackled, this area does not get mention or publicity.  I am aware of one particular case among many where the fraud amounts to approx \u00a3120,000.00 over an 8 year period. Despite this and ample evidence being provided, there is no action. We seem to live in a double standard society where often those that are classed as 'poor' are infact not and should not receive the benefits that they do.  This area needs to be publicised as it is one of the biggest areas of lost revenue and we need to see new policy regarding co-habitation in order to stop this.",
