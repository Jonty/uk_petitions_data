        "background": "The Off-Road Vehicles (Registration) Bill currently making its way through parliament applies only to motorcycles and quad-bikes - not cars or 4x4s.  So all bikes, including racing bikes, dirt-bikes and classic and collector's bikes will have to be registered or else destroyed.  Many can't be registered because they don't meet modern safety standards. But all cars will be exempt.\n\nSeveral private companies have recently banned or restricted the use of motorcycles by employees when on company business.\n\nMost recently and outrageously of all, the police in North Wales have launched a road-safety campaign featuring photographs of a decapitated motorcyclist without even consulting his family first.\n\nThis level of persecution would not be accepted against any other sector of society, and shouldn't be accepted against bikers.",
