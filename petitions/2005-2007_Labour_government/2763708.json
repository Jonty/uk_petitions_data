            "background": "Currently contractors are unable to get security clearance for positions with the MOD/government unless they are sponsored by an agency/company who have current contracts with the MOD/Government, and these agencies will not hire non security cleared contractors.  Contractors are in a catch 22 situation and are loosing out on lucrative contracts due to not being able to get security cleared.  Change the law to allow contractors who wish to apply for positions that require clearance to obtain this, without the need to go through an agency/company.",
