            "background": "If Tony Blair wants to do something immediate and effective towards reducing global warming and saving the planet, he should BAN JUNK FAXES. This insidious and annoying form of advertising is on a par with cold calling in terms of invasion of privacy. I receive at least 20 of these things daily and the number seems to increase week by week. I've tried ringing the numbers on the unwanted faxes to be removed from the senders database, but this just costs me more time and money and probably results in more spam faxes. I've also tried registering with websites to have my number deleted from the spammers lists, but this also seems to have had no effect.\nIf every fax machine across the land is wasting the same amount of paper, ink, electricity,and individual time and money as mine, this problem must be costing the economy, and ultimately the environment, a fortune.",
