            "action": "Prevent Newcastle upon Tyne Council from installing yet more \"designer congestion\" traffic \"management\" schemes to cause widespread congestion with the express purpose of demonstrating the (false) need for a congestion charge (a good income source).",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Newcastle Council changes the layout of junctions to cause delays and frustration: reducing to 1 lane at  right junctions so that huge unnecessary queues develop, closing main through routes to congest the city centre, rigging traffic lights to stop the main routes, then DOUBLING traffic by closing exits to streets so everyone has to do a u turn. Finally, on the south end of the Tyne Bridge - changing the right filter lane for the world's first backward roundabout and crossroads, which stops the main route in and out of the city causing a 2 mile tailback for hours everyday. We can see you are trying to make Newcastle look like a good candidate for congestion charges. Businesses need to move goods and people around the city. This designer chaos discourages investment in the area, and is a scandalous use of public money for political posturing. Others causing this much misery would be in prison for it, these people get a salary!!",
