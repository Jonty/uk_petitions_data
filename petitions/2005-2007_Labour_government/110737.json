            "background": "The cost of living in London is immense. For students in London the cost of living acts as a severe hindrance to their studies. Many are unable to afford to study in London under the current financial arrangements. This has resulted in many talented individuals not studying at all and others seeking cheaper institutions outside London, leaving education in London increasingly a preserve of the rich. Increasing the Higher Education Maintenance Grant to include an element of London Weighting would help to make it affordable to study in London, doing much to aid widening participation.",
