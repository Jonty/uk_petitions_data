Between 2 - 6 years in some cases.  In the meantime, they can not travel outside the UK until their applications have been finalised. Surely this \"guantanamonising\" of immigrants is not what is expected in a civilised society. There is no value for money for those who are caught up in this process. We would request that anyone who has had their application outstanding for over a year receive an immediate refund.  Surely this is the height of inefficiency and is morally wrong.  If this happened to British subjects anywhere else in the world, this would be deemed unacceptable.  Join us in \"Wilberforcing\" the government to reconsider practice where immigrant applicants are kept in limbo.",
