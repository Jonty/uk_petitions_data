            "background": "There are cases where the resident parent is financially better off than the non resident parent and only supporting one child, yet the nonresident parent still has to hand over stupid amounts of money despite the fact that they are responsible for more children in a new relationship, this is forcing families to live in poverty. the CSA will only count the first 3 children, so there could be 6 but 3 would not be calculated. this system is barbaric. I know of several case where the CSA are forcing children into poverty to give money to a parent that is finacially better of than they are. This has to be stopped, things are hard enought anyway and this system is destroying families and forcing people to work illegally.",
