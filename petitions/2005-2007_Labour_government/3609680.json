Most dentists now refuse NHS patients, children, the old aged, the infirm or just unemployed. \n\nAs a medical profession this is a disgrace, what are these people to do for dental treatment? travel 80 or 90 miles to a practitioner who WILL treat them? Or take a credit card to pay the cost which can \u00a340 to \u00a380 per filling if not more in some areas. If they are on income support, incapacity benefits, disability etc then this may in itself not be possible at ALL.\n\nYet by simple legislation it could be made illegal for any practicing dentist in the UK to refuse to treat patients on the grounds that they are NHS.",
