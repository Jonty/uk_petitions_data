            "background": "With the government discusing the posibility of introducing road pricing I demand the government consider subsidising  PUBLIC TRANSPORT. \n\n\nExamples:\n\nIts cheaper for me to travel from Bristol to Manchester by air than using VIRGIN TRAINS. \n\nUsing PUBLIC TRANSPORT ( bus - train - coach )travelling from Wiltshire to London Heathrow (3hrs 30 minutes) costs \u00a387.00  Parking at LHR for a month costs \u00a390.00. (2hrs)\nWho wants the inconvenience of extra travel\n time, carrying luggage on & off three types of transport saving \u00a33.00 to consider the environment and being a good citizen!\n\nOyster card \u00a380.00 per month.\nTravel time from Hammersmith to Central London W1 before Congestion Charging - 30 minutes.\n\nAfter the charging was introduced 60 minutes.\n(The newly introduced western extension) travel time - 60 minutes.\n\nPrime Minister: You gave John Prescott the duty to introduce an intergrated TRANSPORT SYSTEM in 1993. \n\nHow is the country benefiting from your request?",
