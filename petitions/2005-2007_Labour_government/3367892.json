        "background": "Pensioners in some countries recieve the full annual increase whereas expat pensioners in other countries recieve no rise. As expats have paid taxes (and continue to do so in many cases) and National Insurance all of their lives, and are not a drain on the UK's resouces, why is this inequality allowed to continue? I am sure that this inequality makes many of them maintain an address in England simply so they can recieve the rises, thus making them become criminals.",
