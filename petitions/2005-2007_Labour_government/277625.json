Mr. Prime Minister I, like so many of my countrymen, beseech you to persevere in your beliefs as regards the Israeli's, of whom I am a staunch supporter, and the Iranian threat. I believe you have a very influencial oppurtunity, not only as Prime Minister, but also as a future private citizen of your country, to help to ensure that the west does not repeat the mistakes prior to WW II.  Therefore I petition you to keep showing the backbone you have revealed, and keep up the stiff upper lip, in resisting the evil forces that have been unloosed upon mankind and, please, do not give in to the hysteria of appeasement that will certainly spell our doom. I believe that you are a man of honour who has a very strong conscience of what is right and wrong and is not distracted by the gray ares of ambivilence and weak willed appeasement.    With all respect and sincerity,   William Collins",
