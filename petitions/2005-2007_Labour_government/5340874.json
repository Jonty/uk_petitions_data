            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Coverage of civil wedding ceremonies by professional wedding photographers is currently not allowed in many parts of UK.\n\nWhere photography is allowed, it is often restricted to a few photos of the exchange of rings, and a setup photo of the signing of the marriage register.\n\nMany couples opt to use a documentary photographer for their wedding, who takes photographs throughout the day, with little or no posing of the couple, aiming to record a story of the day.  The ban on photography during Civil Ceremonies leaves a gap in the coverage of the wedding, usually one of the most emotional and important parts of the day for the couple.\n\nThere is no law in the UK banning photography during these events, but instead it is left to the whim of the district or registrar presiding.  \n\nThis petition is for the government to issue guidelines instructing all registrars offices to allow professional photography throughout ceremonies.",
