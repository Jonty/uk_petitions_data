            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Treaty is a radical document that fundamentally changes the legal basis of the EU by:\n1.Establishing a President of the European Council with sweeping powers,\n2.Setting up a \"High Representitive of the Union for Foreign Affairs and security\" ie an EU Foreign Minister.\n3. Establishing an EU Diplomatic Service,\n4. Giving the European Court of Justice powers over home affairs issues and the power to harmonise our civil and criminal laws,\n5.Giving the EU a legal personality to sign treaties on Britain's behalf,\n6. Taking away our national veto on far too many sovereign issues,\n7.Establishing mechanisms to self-amend the Treaty which will allow  the EU to seize further powers without the need for new agreements.\n\nWe have never been allowed a vote on the European Union (as opposed to the Common Market). WE NEED ONE NOW.",
