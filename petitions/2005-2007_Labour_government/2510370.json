        "background": "Brian Clough scored 251 goals in a playing career from 1952-1964 playing for Middlesborough and Sunderland where he scored 63 goals in 74 games. His first management role with Derby County got them promoted to the first division within two years and winning the title in the 1971-1972 season for the first time in their history. They also reached the semi-finals of the European Cup. In 1975 he took over at Nottingham Forest who were at the time a second division side. In his second season in charge, they were promoted to the first division. In their first season, Forest won the League Cup and ran away with the title. They won the League Cup a further four times and the European Cup in 1979 and 1980. During his time as manager, Forest went unbeaten for 42 league games, a record that has only recently been beaten (by Arsenal). He was the greatest manager that England never had and should be awarded this award in recognition of his services to the National Game.",
