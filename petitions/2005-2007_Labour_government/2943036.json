            "background": "Whatever the policies of this government the truth of the current situations are often ignored to pursue a political strategy.\nThe current daily propaganda is the pursuit of \"Congestion Charge\". The current policy for London has failed and to ensure that to present it as a \"Success\" alterations are to be made and the scheme extended to other cities.\nThe REAL problems facing Britain is that of Immigration. Too many people chasing too few rescources.\nWe are 'contracted' to accept immigrants from the European Union and we are 'Obligated' to accept Asylum Seekers. The Problem could be relieved by reducing Asian immigrants (on a Permenance basis). Giving away British Citizenship only masks the problem.\nWe must reduce immigration now and Drop the Multicultural policies. Therefore This petition asks that We reject this government's policy of Immigration from outside the European Union, we reject the policy of recruiting foreign Labour from outside the European union and employ stringer penalties for illegal immigration.",
