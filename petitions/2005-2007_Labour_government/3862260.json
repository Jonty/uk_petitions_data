        "background": "There seems to be a bias in medical science toward allowing any person that wants to have a child some degree of treatment within the NHS.  There are more than enough people around as it is and the one step we need to take to ensure sufficient resources for everyone is to keep out own numbers in check.  The human population goes up by 2.5 every second (i.e. births/sec minus deaths/sec = 2.5) which means an increase of 212,907 per day.  \n\nOn the NHS if you want a vasectomy and have no kids you get an immediate refusal but if you have no kids and want some you get help.  This is unfair and biased towards population increase.  Controlling our numbers is the most important step toward a healthy world and using medical resources on those naturally infertile is counterproductive.\nLet us focus on contraception.",
