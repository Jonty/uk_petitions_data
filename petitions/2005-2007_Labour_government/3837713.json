            "background": "Shecdule 2 of the Telecommunications Act 1984 (Sch 3 of the Communicatiosn Act 2003) gives telecom operators blanket powers that supercede all Land Lord & Tenants legislation. The purpose of the Code was to protect networks for essential public interets. It is being misused by operators to enforce unfair contractual advantage. Sch 3 of the CA 2003 need to be replaced such that there is no blanket ability to use the powers without control but that the powers may be used only on the authorisation of OFCOM subject to a test of essential necessity and overriding public interest. As it stands the Code is being used to abuse property owners, delay development, etc.",
