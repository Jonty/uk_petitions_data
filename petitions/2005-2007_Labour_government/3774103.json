            "background": "We urge the Prime Minister to amend or scrap the current Bill passing through Parliament that would allow forced entry to bailiffs enforcing sundry debts, such as credit card debt. The Government is being naive in thinking that this provision would be anything other than abused. If banks are disreputable enough to make extortionate and illegal charges, their agents are disreputable enough to make ordinary people's lives  a misery for their own financial gain, without due regard to the intention or detail of this Bill",
