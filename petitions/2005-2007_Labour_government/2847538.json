        "background": "This petition seeks the introduction a law limiting the engine size for new driver to 1400 or less for the first two years.\n\nWith the highest death rates on our roads caused by newly passed drivers the law should be changed to only allow them to drive engine sizes of 1400 or less for the first 2 years after passing the test.  \n\nAt the moment a newly passed driver can get behind the wheel of any high powered car, often leading to erratic and dangerous high speed driving.\n\nAs we are all aware passing the driving test is just the first step to becoming a competent driver.  All too often people with little experience cause death and injury because they are driving high powered cars that they can\u2019t control.",
