We call on the Prime Minister to \"Give a Toss for Britain\" and help increase our nations birth rate! The show concluded that most males would consider giving anonymous sperm donations to help infertile couples or single women but are put off by a recent law which allows donor children to discover who their biological father is at the age of 18. Britain needs more sperm and the government has made things worse!",
