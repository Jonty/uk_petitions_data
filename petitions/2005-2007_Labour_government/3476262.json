They will be allowed to break into your home to check what you have done. You will be charged \u00a31000  if you stop them coming into you home. Then \u00a3200 A Day until you let them SNOOP into your home. Our bills could now rise up to \u00a34000 a year!!!! For WHAT!!!!!!! one, pick up rubbish once a week and street lighting. We can not let this happen, they really can not be allowed to control us in this way. And another thing to think of is, what if robbers or all of the unsavories that live here, choose this opportunity to break into our homes, hiding behind council badges.  God help us....... and the elderly.",
