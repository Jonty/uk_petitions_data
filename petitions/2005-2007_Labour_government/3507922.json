They saved a lot of lives during this conflict that most people had never heard of.\nThe Victoria Cross was instituted by Queen Victoria on the 5th February 1856 as a means of rewarding an officer or man of the Army or Navy who might perform some signal act of valor or devotion to his country in the presence of the enemy.",
