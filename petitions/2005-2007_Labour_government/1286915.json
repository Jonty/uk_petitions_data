            "background": "If there was as much neighbourhood street wardens as there are traffic wardens, crime rates would fall much quicker. I live in London and the streets are full of traffic wardens who prey on motorist in an unfair and unjust manner. If the street warden scheme that is working in a very minute way at the moment, was expanded I believe this would have a very big impact on our unsafe streets. Also there would be a lot less pressure on police resources.",
