        "action": "Give full support for the full-scale production of biofuels as a supplement and eventual replacement for fossil fuels",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Depletion of fossil fuels is inevitable - as is more damage to the atmosphere as more co2 is released from the earth. We must turn to fuels that absorb as much CO2 from the air during growth as they release when burnt. Only a small percentage of car fuel consumption can currently be met by biofuel, but blending it with diesel improves engine wear and cuts harmful pollutants. Some fear that widespread vegetable oil production in developing countries necessary to meet growing needs will threaten their local economies by stifling local food production. But co-operative ventures between Western Governments and oil companies would have the economic might to rescue otherwise barren regions and irrigate them to the benefit of fuel and food crop production, as well as the ecosystem. Whilst a huge investment initially, the long term rewards would be everlasting. This boost would also give breathing space for other viable energy technologies to become established.",
