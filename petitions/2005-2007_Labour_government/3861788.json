            "background": "Tidal power is the greenest of green energy. Using underwater barrages where the tide passes through reversable turbines twice a day coming in and twice a day going out. \nWe are an island nation, nowhere further than 73 miles to the sea, with an extremely long coastline. The sea is our greatest natural resource. With strategically placed barrages around the coast utilising bays and estuaries of high tidal currents we should not need to intrude too much into the environment to create these power stations. The tide will still come in and go out, there will still be tidal areas for wading birds etc. \nAfter initial high cost start ups (no more than nuclear) there will be Zero waste, zero emissions and will meet all of our committments to Kyoto and our power requirements and with relatively little maintenance will last until the moon disappears.\nPeople will accept \"Green Taxes\" if the money is spent on schemes that they will see the benefit to the Nation and the Planet.",
