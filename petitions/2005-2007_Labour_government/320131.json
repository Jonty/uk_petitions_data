            "action": "Reform the Companies Act to abolish the practice of PLC's issueing Ordinary Shares which restrict the shareholder's right to vote and attend company meetings such as the AGM.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A PLC can be set up by a public offering of non-voting shares (\"B\" shares). However the founding directors of the PLC will have shares which do have voting rights (\"A\" shares). The number of \"A\" shares issued may be extremely small compared with the number of \"B\" shares, but only the \"A\" shareholders have a right to vote (for example at the AGM.).\n\nWith this type of share structure there is no possibility of shareholders influencing the direction of their company, however badly it is being run. Most importantly, incompetent or rogue directors cannot be voted out of office by \u201cshareholder power\u201d. Such directors can use shareholder's funds for personal enrichment with virtually no check on their behaviour and with very little risk of being brought to account by the authorities.\n\nThere is no justification for PLC's to issue non-voting shares. The practice serves only to benefit unscrupulous and dishonest company directors and should be outlawed.",
