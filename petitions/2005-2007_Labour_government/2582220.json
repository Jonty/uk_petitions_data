        "background": "I am concerned that government policies are increasingly being decided by focus groups and petitions. Where this government has been truly radical, such as in introducing a minimum wage, it has been in the teeth of opposition from others. When these policies have proved successful, others have then adopted them or dropped their opposition to them. What we need is a government with a set of values and beliefs that puts through radical policies that will improve the country, and then we have a chance every five years to vote for or against them.",
