            "background": "Abolishing car tax and increasing petrol tax would save the cost of collection, mean that all users would pay, reduce the cost of chasing car tax crime and reduce crime and costs of courts. (In 2005, 57bn litres fuel were consumed, and \u00a34bn ved collected in 2003. I have assumed that .6Bn\u00a3 would be saved in administration)\nIn rural areas without good public transport, the fuel tax could be reduced, or vendors subsidies.\nIt would also encourage a lower use of cars, and driving more economically, and more efficient cars.",
