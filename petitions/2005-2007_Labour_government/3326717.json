        "background": "Mr Blair needs to scrap plans to introduce stealth taxes on British Motorists in the name of the enviroment and realise that the only people who are going to be taxed off the road are the poor.\nI suggest that Mr Blair scraps plans for extra taxes and go one step further and go right to the heart of our congestion and enviromental problems.\nI believe the Prime Minister should force all Car Manufacturers to only sell enviromentally friendly vehicles in the UK. This would cut our carbon emissions down by around 90% of the current levels.\nHe could even go one step further and force all new home developments to have solar panels and wind turbines as standard.",
