He may not quite be world-renowned, however as the self-made 'Timperley Superstar', he has an international (if not somewhat cult) following, that seems to have gone unrecognised by the powers-that-be.  Be it his tireless work for Regal Zonophone, or other stuff, Frank does not seek this honour himself (too modest), however the waves of support from the nation that will shortly be forthcoming will leave the Honours commitee little alternative to GIVE THE PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT!",
