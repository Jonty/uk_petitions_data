        "action": "Review the regulations about induction of newly qualified teachers which are preventing them from carrying out supply work after 4 terms and putting many out of work",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Newly qualified teachers are expected to start a period of structured induction in schools within four terms of qualifying and may not do more than 4 terms supply work.  In areas of the North, where there are more teachers than posts, new teachers cannot find permanent posts to begin induction and, once they reach the end of the four terms, cannot teach.  In exceptional circumstances, the local authority can grant them another year to try, but once this is over they have no option but to leave the profession or break the law by working illegally.  This is unfair on them and their families and wasteful of the public funding that went into training them.  This situation should be reviewed urgently.",
