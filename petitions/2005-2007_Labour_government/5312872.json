            "background": "It appears we are one of the few countries which insists on laying utility materials under our roads.  This means that when one needs upgraded, the roads are continually dug up and poorly repaired afterwards.  I propose we carry all pipework under pavements or above the road, as seen in Germany and keep the roads free for traffic.",
