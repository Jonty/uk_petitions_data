        "background": "Sheffield United were relegated on May 13, 2007, after West Ham were able to win at Manchester United courtesy of a goal from Carlos Tevez. Tevez, and his compatriot Javier Mascherano, were signed by West Ham in breach of Premier League rules U13 and U18. Typically this would bring about a points deduction, but instead the PL fined the club as the offence had been committed under a previous chairmanship. Tevez has since been a star player for West Ham. The \u00a35.5m fine that West Ham received has been cancelled out at least five-fold by the TV rights attached to a further season in the Premier League, , keeping them up while Sheffield United, who had committed no wrong, were relegated. I call on the Prime Minister, as a football fan, to put pressure on the Premier League to retain its integrity and give clubs that break its rules the punishment that is fair on all its member clubs.",
