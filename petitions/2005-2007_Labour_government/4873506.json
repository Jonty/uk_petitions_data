Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology). Despite this ALL passenegers are subject to delays and restrictions to avoid offending indentified risk sections of the population\n\nMetal detection, passive sniffing technology and profiling are sufficiently advanced to return security to it's former discreet levels without increasing risk\n\nThe searching of children and the elderly in non-risk and family groups is particularly distressing \n\nThose who find they are on the 'watch list' should be given a right of legal challenge 'in camera' to avoid confusion over mistaken identity",
