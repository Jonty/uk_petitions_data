Each current recipient will now be required to fill in badly worded and difficult forms to re-apply for pay that they already receive. These forms must then be assessed and verified by third parties, costing considerable sums of money in administration, It could be understood if this was required of new recipients but to require existing recipients to do so cannot be a good example of best practice or common sense.",
