            "background": "There are so many people living in almost free accomodation and still enjoying the perks of a new car, holidays e.t.c. Should people receiving help from the working tax payer be able to afford such luxuries? There are couples who work full time living in such accomodation and I beleive it encourages benefit fraud and it's certainly not an example to set children growing up in these situations, showing them it's easier to aim for a free home rather than work hard in education and employment to get something in life and as a result - the more home owners, surley a possible tax reduction we are currently paying? Keep it for the ones who really need help.",
