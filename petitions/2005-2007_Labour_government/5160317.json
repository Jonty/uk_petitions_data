The Bearded Lady of Guildford should be acknowledged with this tribute whilst her beard still flows freely.\n \nThis is in no way a malicious petition.  The Bearded Lady has a big place in the hearts of the people of the area and we wish her memory to live on for the future childen of Surrey.  The statue should stand as a symbol to freedom of personal expression!",
