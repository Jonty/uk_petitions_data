            "background": "PGCE teacher trainees are typically in the university for 2 months of their whole course. The rest of the time, they work in schools, becoming more experienced at teaching. During this time, when they are not being tutored very much at all, they still have to pay fees. For example: A Geography trainee has to pay \u00a3375 per month for not even being in university! This seems unfair because they end up working for the state at the end of their course!",
