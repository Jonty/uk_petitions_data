It is known internationally that Eurovision is purely a political tool and that due to the Iraq war and certain other countries general dislike of the UK, we will not win again for years.\nWhy should we bother? Our taxes pay for this either directly via central Gevernment or indirectly via the BBC licence fee.\nLet all the new 'Europeans' pay.  Particularly Russia - when did they join Europe?\n\nPlease vote for this E-petition.\nThanks.",
