            "background": "We are two mums who both have children that have a condition called Hip Dysplasia.\nMy daughter Mia has just turned two and had her first operation in September. Jessica is eleven months and has recently had her operation. After the operation they are placed in a hip spica cast which goes from the chest down to the ankles,legs at right angles with a bar in between. These casts are extremely heavy and wide and render the children completely immobile.\nWe were amazed when we found out that our children weren't eligible for a Blue Badge.It is completely impossible to get them in or out of a car in a normal car parking space.\nOur campaign is being supported by the National charity \"Steps\" and also have other disability organisations including Contact a Family who are partners in the Every Disabled Child Matters campaign.\nWe have been getting the same answers from the Department for Transport,that they are consulting, that there are reviews ongoing.",
