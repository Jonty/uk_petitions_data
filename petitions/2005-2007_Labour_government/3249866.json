            "background": "The plans for the new council tax are highly intrusive and an attack on our democratic way of life.Further more if these plans go ahead people will have no incentive to improve their homes or environment because they will be taxed. It is difficult to understand how a government at one turn asks that people become involved in their community and at the same time wants to tax us if in so doing we improve it.\nA local income tax or community charge maybe the answer but not to charge people for spending their own,already taxed money,improving their property either inside or out.",
