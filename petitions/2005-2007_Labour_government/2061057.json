        "background": "This is more specific than other petitions. Sport is mostly a spectator entertainment, with no health or fitness benefit to those who watch it. In fact, it tends to have the reverse effect with televised events, in that it helps to create 'couch potatoes'.\n\nThere is little that sport has to offer the modern world e.g. the use for the javelin finally disappeared when the Bushhmen were coaxed out of the Kalahari.\n\nIt is bad enough having TV and other media swamped with Olympic coverage without having to pay for the loss of normal content too.\n\nAny funding should be via a levy on admission charges to sports events and TV broadcasts of sport, etc. In that way, it will be mostly those who want it who will pay for the outrageous cost. (Remember the financial mess Athens got into!).",
