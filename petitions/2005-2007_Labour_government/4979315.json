There was a time when the police would have to look into any offence, that time is long gone. The police can decide whether or not to act, but on what do they base that decision? Arbitrary selective enforcement of these offences is both confusing and dangerous. Many laws are not enforced at all although they remain compulsory statutes. The laws need repealing if they are not being enforced. Otherwise, they need modifying to spell out under what conditions they can be enforced or ignored. If this is not done, we are at the whim of (unknown future) police (etc) authorities as to what consitutes acceptible behaviour, and that is something that parliament should decide.",
