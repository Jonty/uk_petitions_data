            "background": "Sewerage is the inevitable by-product of human life. It gives off highly inflammable methane gas, which is due to chemical reactions as it breaks down. If large vats were installed at sewerage treatment works, allowing the rotting solids to ferment for a period of time, methane gas would be produced, this could then fuel methane powered electricity generators that could be connected to the National Grid. Along with tidal barrages, wind turbines, solar power and modern cleaner coal burning power stations this would be another good alternative to nuclear / atomic power.",
