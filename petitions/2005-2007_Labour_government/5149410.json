            "background": "I am concerned that there is pressure on the courts system to reduce both the number of people sent to prison and the sentences allocated to them. I believe that people found guilty of a crime should be punished appropriately, and that the decision as to what is an appropriate punishment should not be influenced by how many prison cells are available at that point in time. I would also prefer a criminal to serve more of the sentence given to them - at least 90%, rather than 30-50%.",
