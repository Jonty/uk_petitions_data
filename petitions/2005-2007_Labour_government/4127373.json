        "background": "We believe the following to be true:\n\n1: The current government is taking very few effective measaures to counter climate change, with most measures being taken \"just for show\",\n2: The amount of taxation under the current government has increased much more dramatically than the rate of useful public spending,\n3: Point 2 is largely the fault of the current government's so-called \"green taxes.\"\n\nBy abolishing all current \"green taxes\" and implementing no new ones, the government will be forced to spend the money that it has extracted from the income of hardworking UK citizens more effectively, using good judgement rather than increased taxation to fund its whimsical environmental initiatives.",
