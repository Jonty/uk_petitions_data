        "background": "Gordon Brown, Tony Blair, and Margaret Thatcher (amongst many other ministers of this and previous UK Governments) have attended meetings of the Bilderberg Group in the Netherlands. \nThese meetings are attended by heads of Government, heads of private industry, and other individucals from around the world. The meetings are held behind closed doors, in secrecy, and remain unreported. This circumvents the democratic right of the UK electorate to have any issues that affect them discussed openly and publicly in the House of Commons. The people of the United Kingdom, who have elected Her Majesty\u2019s Government, have a moral and constitutional right to know the detail and effect of any and all decisions made at Bilderberg Group meetings (an unelected body) which may affect the citizens of the United Kingdom in any manner whatsoever.",
