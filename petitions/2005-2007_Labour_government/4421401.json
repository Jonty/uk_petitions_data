            "background": "At present foreign lorries do not pay anything to use our roads. Because of this, together with the fact that they pay the foreign drivers less, British haulage companies are going out of business. They fill up their tanks across the channel and can hammer up and down our motorways, increasing congestion and increasing the rate of wear and tear without contributing a penny. These lorries do not have the same stringent tests that British lorries have and neither do the drivers, thereby increasing the number of accidents on our motorways. By introducing a tax which would be payable at the port of entry, it would not be so attractive to these foreign haulage companies and would help with the cost of road maintenance. After all everyone has to pay a toll in France on their motorways.",
