            "background": "That MPs expenses and pensions, should only rise with inflation at the same rate as pensioners in the country. MPs lump sums when they lose office should also be paid at the same rate as an employee in the private and public sector. Most are set at a level of 6 weeks or less for every year of service with a maximum payment being made. MPs should also have to wait for their pensions until they reach the same age that has been set for the rest of the public in the country. After all they are only doing a job they have being elected to do and which was their choice. Why should they be treated any different.\n\n Members of the Cabinet should be treated differently as should the PriMe Minister as they have carried most of the responsibility of office.",
