            "background": "Rafael Benitez won the Champions League and yet hasn't even received an OBE. I realise that Rafa isn't British, but then neither was Bob Geldof, but he received a Knighthood and he's never even won a European Cup! This is not equitable!\n\nAs he is not a member of the British Empire (BE), and therefore can't officially be made an KBE, can I suggest instead that he is made a Knight of a Foreign Country?\n\nI demand that this Government Posthumously awards Rafa the KFC immediately!",
