In some cases they are being threatened with religious sanctions unless they follow church doctrine in their political decisions.\n\nIt is therefore important for constituents to know what religious affiliation is held by their MP in order to understand the effect this might have on their policies and voting decisions.\n\nAn effective way for MPs to declare their religious affiliations would be to require this information to be listed in the register of members' interests.",
