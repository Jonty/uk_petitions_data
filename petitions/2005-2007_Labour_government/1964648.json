In consequence of this, he is implicit in the unnecessary deaths of many of our armed forces personnel.\nOur country needs a leader of good character, a leader willing to put the country first and political ideals second.  Tony Blair has a proven track record of not representing the rights of the British people, and as such is not fit to hold office.",
