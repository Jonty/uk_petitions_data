            "background": "My petition is to promote two new rights: The right to promote new legislation through 'an initiative' and to challenge an existing piece of legislation or government action through referendum.\n1.To allow any British citizen the right to propose new legislation by launching an initiative. If that citizen manages to gather 500,000 signatures in support of the proposal, it must be put to a nation-wide vote. And the result must be binding on the government.\n2.If any person or group opposed to a new law manages to collect 250,000 signatures within 100 days of the official publication of the proposed legislation or government action, the voters as a whole are given the chance to decide. And the result must be binding.\nIn both cases, there must be at least 55% of the total electorate who vote, and a simple majority of those who vote carries the day.",
