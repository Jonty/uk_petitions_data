It stops Business from trading as they are unable to receive legitimate e-mails. The US government has managed to ban and enforce Gambling on the internet of companies that are not even in the US. Therefore it is possible for our Government to do the same. Assets in the UK should be seized from these offenders and help fund UK Prisons. Joint inititives should also be carried out with other countries where other offenders are based.",
