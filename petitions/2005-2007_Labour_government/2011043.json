            "background": "Our pension funds are in crisis and many people face hardships in retirement. This has not been helped by the taxes on the dividends of pension fund investments. Each year these taxes remove around \u00a350 Billion from our pension funds making it less likely that the funds will be able to suport us in our old age. I call on Tony Blair to remove the taxes on pension funds that were introduced by his administration.",
