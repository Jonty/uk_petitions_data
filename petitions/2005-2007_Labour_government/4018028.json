            "background": "To seriously tackle greenhouse gas emissions, we have to change the way we live our lives and how we get around.\nTransport is a key issue in this,we are addicted to our own safe fast moving cars, but we have no choices at present, as the roads are far too dangerous to ride on. We have to make our towns and countryside bicycle friendly, low impact on the environment and 0 on emmisions. It will change our way of life with one sweep, and leave an incredible legacy for the people of the future. Disabled and the elderly need help also, so small scale tram lines need to be built along all bicycle tracks.\nPlease sign today.\nWendy Vickerman\nSchool Principle of Montessori Eco School",
