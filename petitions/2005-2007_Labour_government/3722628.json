            "background": "We are writing to ask you to support a new ASLEF campaign to protect the H&S of train drivers & the general public. In particular I am asking you to sign parlimentary EDM 247 which states:\n\nThat this house is concerned by the report form the Rail Safety & Standards Board (RSSB) which found a dramatic increase in the number of signals passed at danger (SPAD) in July 2006 to 42 incidents an increase of 62% compared with the same period in 2005, & 20% higer than the previous 3 year average, when weather temperatures were much lower; concerned that the extremely high temperatures of July 2006 affected the performance of train drivers, thereby increasing the number of SPADS & compromising the safety of drivers & the general public; calls upon train operating companies to ensure that all train cabs are fitted with sustainable air temperature control devices.\n\nI hope that as our Prime Minister we can count on your support.",
