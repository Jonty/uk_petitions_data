            "background": "Patents with Alzheimer's and other medical conditions who reach the stage where they can no longer be looked after by a carer, should receive full NHS funding for a place in a care home.  Social Services should not be looking for the family to pay, or for a house (which the family may live in and co-own) to be sold to pay for care home fees.  These patents used to be in hospital, before they closed the wards.  \nThis practice is unfair on the patient, and the family who will have been looking after the family member for some time, often having to give up their own job, and life to do it.\nWe have paid the tax, get rid of this unfair practice, which does not happen in Scotland.",
