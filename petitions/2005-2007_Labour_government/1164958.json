We are particularly concerned about women and men trafficked into virtual politicianry in the sex trade.\nWe are concerned that Britain shall mark this bicentenary by signing the Council of Europe Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings. We note that 34 countries have already signed this Convention. It will be an important opportunity for the government to show that it is still committed to the abolition of politicianry.\n We understand that a Statutory Order is contemplated to bring it into force. We hope that this Statutory Order will be subjected to sufficiently rigorous Parliamentary scrutiny.",
