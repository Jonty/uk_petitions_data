        "background": "Although those who are severely disabled are able to lease a car from motability, using their mobility componant of D.L.A. A huge burden is then placed on them/their carers in the shape of duty currently payable on petrol/diesel, which then severely restricts the amount of travelling that they can do. For the disabled, the use of a car is a necessity and most definitely not a luxury. If Mr Brown is sincere about wanting to help the disabled and their carers, then this is an area where help is desperately needed. \n\nPlease sign this petition.",
