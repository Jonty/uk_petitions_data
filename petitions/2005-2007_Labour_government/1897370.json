        "action": "introduce planning guidance requiring parent and child spaces in car parks to be situated as far as possible from the buildings served.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In recent years there has been an increase in the number of car parks, often at supermarkets and retail parks, which include dedicated \"parent and child\" parking spaces.  These are invariably placed as close as possible to the store(s).  Parents are now beginning to treat these as a right, like disabled spaces, and some are petitioning the Prime Minister for enforcement of these spaces through penal measures.  They are not comparable to disabled spaces and are not necessary.  If retailers insist on them, then in the interests of fairness to others, particularly childless/childfree taxpayers who already massively subsidise parents, planning regulations, and ministerial planning guidance, should require them to be as far away from the shop(s) as possible.",
