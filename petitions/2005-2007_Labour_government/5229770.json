            "background": "Why should anyone need an air gun for pest control?  My cat of 12 years old has just been shot in the face and killed by an air gun.  This was obviously an act of mindless fun. Anyone can purchase one.  How long before the person that shot my cat will maim or kill a child or an elderley person.  There have been recent reports of birds, sea gulls and other animals being killed by air guns in our local area. Its sickening. This isnt pest control, this is target practice.  Recognition of how evil people can be should be brought light.  Pest control should be organised by proper authorities and not the general public.  Air guns are \"weapons\" and should be classified as such.",
