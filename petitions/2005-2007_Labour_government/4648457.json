An appropriate upload interface would be sensible too.\n\nThis means that I could log into my \"Supermarket A\" account, download the favourites in a standard format (eg XML), log into the \"Supermarket B\" site and upload it there. That way, I can simply and quickly move my online shopping to a different supermarket without all the hassle of searching item by item.",
