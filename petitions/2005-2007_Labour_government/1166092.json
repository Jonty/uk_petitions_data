        "background": "We believe that Cornwall should have its own public holiday on the 5th March to commemorate St Piran\u2019s day.\n\nCornwall has been ignored in the establishment of regional assemblies and the black and white cross of St Piran\u2019s flag, a well established symbol of the Cornish identity, is largely neglected by the rest of the country. \n\nSt Piran's Day is very popular in Cornwall as a statement of regional identity. We do not understand or accept why our political leaders ignore Cornwall\u2019s contribution to the cultural heritage of the British Isles, while giving such prominence to other regions.\n\nThe granting of a public holiday to commemorate St Piran\u2019s Day would demonstrate our leaders\u2019 commitment to regional identity.",
