        "action": "Invest a proportion of the duty taken on fuel into creating a British Emission-free car industry",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The technology already exists for car manufacturers to make emission-free vehicles so why are we not seeing the market flooded with these now that public consciousness has been raised to see the importance of environmentally friendly products?  The fuel companies would suffer and so would the government who draw large taxes from that fuel; it\u2019s taxed twice, in fuel duty and then VAT!  In the 2004\u201305 financial year, fuel duty alone generated approximately \u00a323.5 billion and this does not include the VAT raised on the fuel sold.  \n \nSo if you truly intend to reduce our carbon emissions as a nation, please pledge to plough at least some of the \u2018double\u2019 revenue you receive from fuel back into recreating the British car industry, in order for them to begin mass producing emission-free cars for all.  It would ensure the environment is cleaner, more jobs would be created and more cars would be sold and exported thereby helping the economy.",
