            "background": "People are vegetarian for various reasons, ethical beliefs, religious beliefs or simply for the health benefits. Most sweet treats contain gelatine so one of the few treats veggies can have is chocolate. Using animal rennet is unnecessary. Masterfoods could potentially lose millions of customers, creating a threat to their workforce and they are discriminating against a significantly large group of people. I urge non-veggies to sign as well in support of the friends and family they have who have chosen vegetarianism for whatever reason.",
