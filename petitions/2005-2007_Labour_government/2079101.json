            "background": "Currently many bus companies deliver shoddy services, especially on routes with litle or no competition. Their buses are frequently late, and have many breakdowns, i propose a system of fines for companies which provide a consistantly poor service, to encourage a better service on routes with little competition, such as rural routes. This issue is particularly relevant with the current government's wish to introduce a pay as you drive tax system.",
