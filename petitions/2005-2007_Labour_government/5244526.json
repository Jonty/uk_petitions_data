            "background": "I request that Pat Hewitt resigns or gets sacked now.  She should have a government health warning stating she is a danger to the public and public services.  she has destroyed the NHS.  She refuses to listen to nurses but will listen to Doctors.  She gives Consultants 25% pay increase but has no value on nurses.  Alot of taxpayers money has been wasted.  Newly qualified nurses are unable to get jobs.  hospitals are understaffed, underpaided and undervalued.  The health select committee should be made up of people who know what they are doing and are in the NHS.  More independance needed from central government for the NHS.",
