            "background": "i am writing as to why there has been such a big response at the way the press & people have given media cover to mccan case fair enough a child has gone missing which we all feel deeply sorry for the family. But a case of my family, a cousin of mine got killed aboard in a traffic accident in 2003 thames news at the time gave it a little coverage and the family brought the body back to be buried Alison Beckford was only 15 when it happened but nothing of this big publicity and big story was mentioned. Is it one rule for upper class people and another for the ones that dont matter answer me that? nearly 4 yrs this year and her parents are still mourning her death, they are not coming to terms with their loss very well. Lawrence family got a wide spread, demeola's family what about other families? very disappointed in this country and your system.\n\na very hurt and disappointed family member.",
