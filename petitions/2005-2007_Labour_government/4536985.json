I and many of my fellow sailors are embarrassed and ashamed by such actions and believe that the only way to make these actions honourable is to donate ALL monies gained to the Royal British Legion or Solder Sailor Airmen and families association. May all our thoughts be with those families who have lost loved ones out in Iraq and Afghanistan.",
