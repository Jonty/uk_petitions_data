            "background": "In Northumberland, currently, school children of middle and high school age who live more than 3 miles from their nearest school, of whom there are many, are entitled to free bus transport to school. However, when students continue into sixth form, they are required to pay \u00a3360 a year for a bus pass. Most students refuse this in favour of driving in themselves and, as the catchement areas of Northumberland are wide, often do not have the option to car share. This leads to unnecessary carbon emissions, as the bus system is already in place before the students reach 6th form age. A reduction in the price would encourage students to take the public transport and would so reduce emissions.",
