            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The public sector pension bill is unsustainably high and it is unfair on taxpayers, who do not generally receive such benefits, to foot the bill for this through taxation, especially Council Tax. It is off balance-sheet so does not show as Govt borrowings. The private sector is moving towards a fairer defined contribution system, in which the individual pensioner bears investment risk - the public sector should move inb the same direction. One other major benefit of this shift would be to encourage all members of these schemes to become more financially aware/literate and to take more interest in their own finances.",
