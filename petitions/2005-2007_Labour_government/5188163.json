            "background": "In view of the huge damage being done to the environment coupled with the inability of aeroplanes to use non-oil derived fuel, air travel in the UK should be reduced each year by 5% from a 2007 base. This would obviate the need for new (probably never-to-be-used) airports and would enable us to close the existing ones gradually, returning them to nature reserves or farmland. Air travel will have finished in any case within 20 years after Peak Oil, this will give the UK an advantage over other countries.",
