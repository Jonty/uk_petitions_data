            "background": "Dartford have moved divisions to equal out numbers. Originally Molesey were moved but  after votes were taken at the Ryman League meeting and they were reprieved. Corinthians Casuals who were due to be relegated from division 1 south have now been reinstated in Div.1 south because dartford have moved. It would be right to relegate Corinthians Casuals and promote the most suitable side from the Div.1 north feeder leagues and place them in that league. Last season Drtford had the highest attendence in the league and were involved in numerous local derbies. Dartfords away matches gave a good chance for smaller clubs to pick up a lucrative gate. Now less Dartford fans wil travel to away games because it will be further and will cost through the Dartford crossing.",
