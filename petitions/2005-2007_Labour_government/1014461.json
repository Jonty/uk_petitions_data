            "background": "I would like to see a scheme calling on 16/18 year olds being trained towards gaining an award on the skills of becoming useful members of our society, and to be able to achieve an all round start in life, both in having practical and social training in becoming truly responsable persons on life, after school.\nThis idea is not a National Service one, to learn ways of fighting wars, but a Service to learn how to be given the chance of knowing right from wrong, being trained to appreciate others and being given the skills to become mature caring adults.\nOur younger generation seem to be crying out for a stable start in life when they leave school,let them have the chance to gain an award of excellence after passing out of the UK CITIZENS AWARD SERVICE.\nIt would require at least a 2 year commitment away from home, with holidays of course.\nLets put back the pride in our younger folk,lets not be afraid to get an opinion about something like this.",
