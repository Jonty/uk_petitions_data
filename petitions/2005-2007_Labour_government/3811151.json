            "background": "Despite benefits to children it\u2019s becoming impossible for parents to take a break from work, as children are the future it\u2019s important to offer parents some flexibility.  Parents are asking for flexitime to complete an important task-to raise the doctors and teachers of the future.  Parents who ask for flexitime desire to be good employees while being good parents.  Employers must accept some aspects of parenthood take priority over work at times in order to rectify some problems with modern society.  Balanced children benefit both society and the economy.  It has a policy of more carrot, less stick, giving options which lead to happier (effective) employees.   Parents will benefit from flexitime but it could also benefit others forced from work; those who care for a spouse with a debilitating illness, or those who have disabilities which don\u2019t affect the quality of their work but when they can work.  It allows employment of people with new experiences to bring to the workplace.",
