The tracking device will cost about \u00a3200 and in a recent study by the BBC, the lowest monthly bill was \u00a328 for a rural florist and \u00a3194 for a delivery driver. A non working mother who used the car to take the kids to school paid \u00a386 in one month.\"\n\nPlease will the government continue conduct its own research as it has promised, and publish the results for the nation to see.",
