            "background": "The Minister for Police and Security has a chicken fetish when it comes to crime and disorder and the Prime Minister should facilitate McNulty's wish to jump up and down, flapping his arms about at passing criminals. So much useless squawking deserves its own reward. Mr. McCulty's 1 year stint in the chicken outfit should also reduce crime levels to below the European average.",
