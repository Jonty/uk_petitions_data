            "background": "Many Britons have for years been threatened, burgled, bullied, mugged, assaulted, and intimidated by the rising criminal population. The law allows very limited rights of self defence for the victims of crime, even when faced life threatening situations. Her Majesty\u2019s Government has indicated countless times via the PM\u2019s office that crime rates and anti social behaviour are at record levels and the need for more policing exists. But all attempts to use more officers have failed.\n\nI believe that British people who are free from criminal convictions, especially convictionsfor crimes of violence, should be given full rights of self defence. Especially, I mean the rights to buy and use stun guns, tasar guns, mace and similar weapons when faced with dangerous criminals who clearly have criminal attempt. Such weapons are already legally available in the USA and the UK moves closer to the USA in thinking every day.",
