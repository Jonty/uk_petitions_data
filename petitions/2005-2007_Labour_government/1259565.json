        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The non-selective nature of non-organic pesticides and herbicides in domestic gardens is having a dramatic effect on  the numbers and varieties of insects and plants needed for food by birds, small mammals and other vertebrates, particularly in urban areas.  While some may argue the need for such chemicals in farming, it is hard to defend their use for purely aesthetic purposes in gardens.  Organic gardening can be rewarding and increase the number of beneficial animals and their food plants.  A ban on the use of non-organic chemicals in domestic gardens could reverse the decline in bird (and other vertebrate) numbers throughout the UK",
