The wider costs to the economy in lower productivity and lost output could be a further \u00a32 billion each year.\n \nIt is estimated that within 5 years one in three women and more than one in four men will be obese.\nThese statistics are alarming because being overweight, and especially being obese, increases our risk of many health problems, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, certain cancers, stroke, back and joint pain, osteoarthritis, high blood pressure, gallstones, fatty liver and infertility.\n\nSmokers and alcoholics pay tax that helps fund the health treatment they require.  Why shouldn't overweight people?",
