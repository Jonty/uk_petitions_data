        "background": "How many of us are sick of hearing or reading about people who break the Law literally getting away with it?  Soft Conditional Discharges etc. Daily we read in the papers how someone has assaulted a police officer has numerous previous offences taken into consideration only to receive a conditional discharge. Assaults and attacks on people seem rife and it seems to be getting worse. This country seems to be going to the dogs.  We need to be tough, the consequences of crime need to be tough, clear and well known in advance enough so that they actually make people think twice before committing a crime.  The criminals are laughing, time and time again they get away with light sentencing.  The Law seems to protect the criminal on so many occasions, you try to stop a fight or intervene in some way and you are the one who gets into trouble with the Law.  Mr Blair  the good people of the UK ask you to put a stop to criminals literally getting away with it.",
