Whilst individuals are constantly being reminded of their environmental duties, companies continue to use large amounts of packaging with their products. Schemes such as self-rinse and refilling of glass bottles for should be encouraged. \nIn addition, for example, bank statements come with 5/6 sheets of marketing material, which aren't relevant to the statement. At a rough estimate probably ~80% of post ultimately ends up in the waste bin. In some cases, where address are printed, this has privacy issues.",
