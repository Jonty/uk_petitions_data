            "background": "The CSA has recently been in the news due to its various inadequacies. Although this is very true, the real problem with our governments systems of parental care is that when a relationship breaks down irretrievably to the point where one party has to go to court to request access to their own children, there is no method of enforcing the courts wishes which leads to further problems between the parents. The biggest issue with this is how it then impacts the children. It is about time that Mothers who stop the Fathers from having access are brought to justice instead of just reaping the rewards of the benefit system!",
