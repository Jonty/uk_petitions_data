            "background": "Illegal immigrants who have been in this country for a reasonable length of time can only have done so by supporting themselves in the black economy. In doing so, they have not been a burden to the tax payer, but at the same time, have lived difficult lives, struggling to support themselves and their families. Their illegal status has meant that they are easily victimised and have no recourse to the justice system that we all take for granted. At the same time, the government has not been able to keep reasonable records in regard to population, nor has it benefited from the tax revenue that would be gained from granting these people legal status to remain and work in this country.",
