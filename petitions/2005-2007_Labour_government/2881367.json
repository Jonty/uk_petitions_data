        "background": "Truly sustainable means lasting indefinitely (unless some external catastrophe strikes). If a society is not truly sustainable, it will end eventually. To last indefinitely, a society must (at a minimum) only use resources at or below their renewal rates. So, if renewable resources are used beyond their renewal rate or finite resource use doesn't come to an effective end, society is unsustainable. The Prime Minister must recognise, therefore, that economic growth (which requires increasing amounts of resources, even allowing for efficiencies) is not compatible with sustainability. A sustainable society will mean enormous changes for everyone, but not changing means that our society must inevitably end. If the Prime Minister wants a truly sustainable society, he needs to understand the implications and work to create an all party consensus on determining and implementing the necessary changes. The alternative is eventual societal collapse.",
