Stop awarding these obviously extremely lucrative contracts to big corporates who only know how to rip us all off and somehow get you to agree to it.\n\nHow imcompetent (or plain greedy) these people must be to be unable to provide proper costs and plans and stick to them. And how lax of government officials to let it happen.\n\nSTOP IT NOW.",
