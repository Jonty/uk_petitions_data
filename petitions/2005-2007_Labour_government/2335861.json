It is based on fictitious wealth - house values inflated by an unscrupulous and unregulated housing market.\nCouncil Tax is very expensive - requiring whole departments in local authorities to manage and collect.\nCouncil Tax is based on the false idea that everyone should pay, which contravenes the principal of taxation by affordability.\nSave local government costs. Scrap the council tax and increase income tax with a premium that can be allocated to the area where you live.",
