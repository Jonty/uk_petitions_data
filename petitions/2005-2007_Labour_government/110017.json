We urge him to concentrate his energies on solving the curse of homelessness in Britain. He is almost certainly far too busy to have seen the BBC1 documentary 'Evicted' (broadcast on November 29). But someone on his staff should procure a copy of the programme and ask him to watch it. Nothing much seems to have happened under this government to improve our treatment of the homeless, in spite of the valiant efforts of Shelter over the years. We the undersigned request the Prime Minister to urgently tackle the problems of poverty and homelessness in Britain before his own eviction from office.",
