            "background": "Old Compton Street is the heart of Soho, which makes it the heart of London, the Theatre district, the gay scene, tourism central.\n\nIt is barely used as a major through-route anyway, and by pedestrianising the bulk of it, the bars and cafe's could put seats outside and create a vibrant, European style street culture that would draw in millions of pounds of tourism spend.\n\nIt would also create virtually the only outdoor street space in Centrsl London, something which in Summer is sorely needed.\n\nIt could be open to cars between certain hours for loading, and the cross streets (greek street, wardour street etc.) should remain open to traffic so as to ensure there would be minimal disruption to traffic.",
