        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "HGV's and lorries are dangerous and should not be clogging up Britain's road infrastructure; the goods they carry are far more suitable for transport by rail. \n\nIf the Prime Minister is truly concerned with pollution and congestion, then he should concentrate on getting this freight off the road rather than badgering commuters with more taxes. HGV's weigh far more than cars and have far larger engines, resulting in greater wear and tear on our roads and more pollution. They are also far more lethal in traffic accidents. \n\nOther countries in Europe have the sense to restrict the majority of this freight on the railways, and so should Britain. \n\nThis would address pollution, congestion and road safety concerns - that is if the Prime Minister truly has any such concerns.",
