        "action": "Scrap expansion plans at Heathrow, Gatwick & Stansted Airports and build a proper new one on reclaimed land in the Thames Estuary",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The UK needs a major new airport where passengers can interline from short to long haul and vice versa.  No-frills airlines do not interline and can be adequately catered for with limited expansion of existing airports.\n  Heathrow is hopelessly out of date, and in the wrong place.  A modern dedicated airport is long overdue.  UK Taxpayers built a similar one in Hong Kong (later given to the Chinese) at Chek Lap Kok to replace Kai Tak.    \n  Let's build for ourselves a new airport with proper communications in an environmentally (and politically) non-sensitive location and close Heathrow.  If this needs public money, so be it; the Government provides \"launch aid\" to Airbus for the development of new airliners.  \n  Current Government policy seems to demand three South-East hubs.  Interlining passengers, have an unsurprising habit of wanting to take off from the same airport at which they land.\n  Multiple hubs cannot deliver this. A new facility is the only viable long term answer.",
