            "background": "Article 12 of the UNCRC states:\n1. States Parties shall assure to the child who is capable of forming his or her own views the right to express those views freely in all matters affecting the child, the views of the child being given due weight in accordance with the age and maturity of the child. \n\nAnd Article 13 states:\n1. The child shall have the right to freedom of expression; this right shall include freedom to seek, receive and impart information and ideas of all kinds, regardless of frontiers, either orally, in writing or in print, in the form of art, or through any other media of the child's choice. \n\nSo basically, this petition is to ensure local authorities (like county and borough / town council's) seek to promote, listen and act on what young people have to say in any matter that affects them ~ e.g. Education, new builds, and any matter that is debated by such authorities.",
