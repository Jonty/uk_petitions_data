            "background": "I think it should be illegal to call people to try to sell them goods, which they didnt ask for such as mobile phones or mortgages etc without a direct invitation.  Especially the many foreign call centres.  Its not right for peoples phones to ring constantly every few minutes with companies trying to sell you something and they mostly withold their telephone numbers so you cant identify who called. So therefore any businesses should not be entitled to withold their phone numbers when they make calls to private phones so the person can report them",
