            "background": "Under this proposal the government would offer interest free loans, similar to student loans, of up to \u00a320,000 for individuals to make environmental improvements to their properties. \n\nThese loans would be available to any project where practical and permanent improvements are being made to a property, such as the installation of pV cells or solar-water heaters, that will show a significant reduction in power usage by the property. \n\nLoans will be repaid at the market rate of the power saved or in totality when the property is sold. \n\nThis scheme is intended to allow individuals, at no cost to themselves, and little to the taxpayer, to make environmental improvements to their property that reduce or negate the need to rely on power purchased from the national grid hence :\n\nReducing carbon emissions through the use of renewable energies.\nReducing power generation. \nDecentralising power production.",
