Yet despite this the olympic committee have chosen to take a quite frankly embarrising symbol to represent the games. As has been quoted before it looks like a bad 1990's game. The lack of foreward thinking is unbelievable. With so many other choices apparent, and even made and presented on national news bullitins i would be ashamed if this logo is used.\nChange it now.",
