        "background": "We petition the government to encourage the movement of freight throughout the UK by rail instead of road haulage. The benefits to the climate are enormous. In general terms one freight train can carry the same load as around 50+ Lorries. In recent years the trend has been to put freight on the road creating more congestion, foreign lorries without the same safety protection & inspection as UK lorries. \n\nAn example is the freight through Eurotunnel, whilst the lorry freight through the tunnel has expanded the number of international rail freight trains have dropped from 24 trains a day in both directions to today\u2019s level of 4 trains a day in both directions. \n\nOne train, one loco using electric traction is far better for the environment than its equivalent of 50 Lorries with 50 Lorries worth of fuel, road impact, accidents, & congestion.",
