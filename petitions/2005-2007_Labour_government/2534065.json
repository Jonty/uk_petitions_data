            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is the belief of the author of the petition that congestion on our nations motorways can be vastly reduced by making the mis-use of lanes on a motorway a criminal offence. All to often motorways are congested due to people misusing lanes. For example, sitting in the middle lane when not overtaking. It is the belief of the petition that vast amounts of road renovations (4 lanes on the M25 for example) can be avoided/reduced if motorists are forced by law to utilise the motorways to their best effect, i.e. stay in the inside (left) lane unless overtaking. Such schemes have been successfully implemented in countries such as Australia.",
