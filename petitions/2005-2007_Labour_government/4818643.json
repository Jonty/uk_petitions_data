        "background": "I believe the country will suffer  from a lack of educated professionals if students are discouraged from applying to university through fear of large debts.Even children from two parent households with reasonably paid jobs are finding it a huge struggle to manage.In some cases it has even lead to suicide.Tuition should be free.As it is the students get very little time with their tutors.I have two children at universtiy and a third wishing to go.It is totally unacceptable that we should have to support them  in order for them to be educated to degree level or allow them to get into huge debt.It is a short sighted policy.I believe university tuition should be free.",
