            "background": "We the undersigned urge the government to understand that society can not be changed by the invention of new crimes and fines. And to accept that the best way to improve society is by example, by education, and by positive incentives.  We urge the government to lead by example.  To understand, for instance, that the government can foster respect by respecting the will of the people, by respecting democracy, by respecting individuals privacy and rights; the government can improve morality by ensuring that all MP\u2019s and government officials act in a moral and upright manner;  waste collection and recycling can be improved by targeting companies who use excessive packaging instead of fines for innocent consumers, and so on and so on.  We therefore strongly urge the government to desist from the creation of new crimes, and regulations and instead to implement policies of positive incentives and public education.",
