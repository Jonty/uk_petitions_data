        "background": "I for one deal with a number of UK businesses over the telephone.  It is unbelievable how many of these call centres are based elsewhere in the world.  When businesses use call centres from abroad I have found the customer service is very poor. I have spoken to a number of people who have experienced this.  I understand businesses get the staff at reduced costs, but generally they cannot help so you are then transferred to the UK!  I think in the interest of consumers all call centres should be UK based.  This would not only provide more employment but costs would be covered by more satisfied customers staying with the company!",
