            "background": "In 1989 the trade in Ivory was outlawed.\n \nIn 1997, CITES agreed to partially lift the ban, down-listing the status of elephants in Botswana, Zimbabwe and Namibia so that those countries could export ivory stockpiles in a one-time sale to Japan.\n \nIn 2000, South Africa, Namibia, Botswana and Zimbabwe were permitted to down-list their elephant populations.\n \nWe are extremely concerned about the potential for even limited ivory sales to lead to the widespread slaughter of elephants. \nMany African countries are ill-equipped to meet basic anti poaching requirements. In addition, most African countries do not yet have the law enforcement or legal framework to effectively fight poaching and control the ivory trade. \n \nThe trade of ivory from African elephants has also put tremendous pressure on Asian elephants, as only the males have tusks. In one nature reserve in India, there are 400 female elephants but only four adult males.\n \nThe ivory trade should not be allowed to continue.",
