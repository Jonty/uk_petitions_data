            "background": "Barry Gardiner MP, the current Parliamentary Secretary for Biodiversity, Landscape and Rural Affairs - including inland waterways - has lost the confidence of waterway users. In a breathtaking performance before the EFRA Select Committee in April, he also appeared to demonstrate that his relationship with British Waterways has irreparably broken down. By contrast, Sir Peter Soulsby, MP for Leicester South, has shown an excellent grasp of current funding problems and other waterway issues. A narrowboat owner and former vice-chairman of BW, he had an impressive track record as leader of Leicester City Council.",
