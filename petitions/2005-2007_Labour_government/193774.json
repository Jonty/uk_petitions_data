            "action": "change the rules on the eligibility of citizens who may stand for Parliament so as to exclude any who have a tax domicile outside of the UK, and who as a consequence may vote in Parliament to enact tax legislation in the UK which does not fully apply to them.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Under the UK's complex personal tax system, the tax status of each person depends on three different sets of complicated rules: about their tax residence, their tax ordinarily resident status and their tax domicile.  \n\nSo a MP who inherited their tax domicile from outside the UK (usually via their parents) will have privileged tax treatment: for example, he or she will not be liable to inheritance tax on assets situated outside the UK.  This is a ridiculous situation: representation without taxation!  So the petition calls for all those who stand for election to Parliament to have a tax domicile in the UK, so that they will be fully subject to inheritance and all other taxes in full measure as though they lived in the UK full time and intended to stay here forever.  Not an unreasonable demand, is it?",
