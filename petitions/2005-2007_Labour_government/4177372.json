This reduced rate came into effect on 1 January 2001. (HMRC Reference:Notice 701/18 (March 2002))\n\n Any woman will tell you that these items are NOT luxury items but a necessity for us during menstruation. Why should we be taxed on a product that we HAVE to use every month for maybe 45 years of our life? I therefore propose that the Government removes ALL VAT on sanitary wear.",
