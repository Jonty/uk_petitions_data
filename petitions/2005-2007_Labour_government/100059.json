We feel that extra taxes added to regular bulbs to encourage people to buy energy efficient bulbs would be 'too little too late'....we need the government to be bold and brave and take the initiative- you'll be doing everyone a big favour and someones got to do it FIRST!\n\nSIGN OUR PEACEFUL PETITION TO 'BAN THE BULB'",
