Westminster's council have announced plans to charge for all motorcycle parking. The Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea plans to convert the majority of free parking bays into secure bays for residents only and charge residents for parking outside their own homes.\n\nIt is unacceptable to penalise the most congestion friendly vehicles and is just a ploy for greater parking revenue!",
