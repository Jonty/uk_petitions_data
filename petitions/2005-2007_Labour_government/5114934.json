            "background": "Manchester Council intends to introduce a congestion charge on the major roads leading into the city of Manchester, this charging zone goes out about 10 miles from the city in all direction, an area many times the size of Londons charging area. Manchester does not have the public transport infrastructure that London has and many of us need to use the car to go to work and go shopping etc. \n\nThe cost of this scheme will see me having to pay a further \u00a325 per week to go to work (9 miles & 1/7th of my take home pay) or take a train 2 buses and a tram each way to work on a journey that we see me having to commute appoximately 25 miles each way and an extra 90 minutes. I know of others in the same situation. Please sign this petition to stop them taxing me and people like me into having to give up working.",
