        "background": "It is time the British Police Force caught up with the times. The Police can no longer effectively do its job when facing criminals that are better armed than themselves. It is time all front line Police Officers were armed with side arms when on duty to provide better protection to themselves and to the public. This is particularly important with the current rise in the number of Officers killed on duty by criminals, the rise in gun crime and the threat of terrorism.",
