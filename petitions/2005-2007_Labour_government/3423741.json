            "background": "Many property owners are having thier properties devalued by neighbours moving in and turning domestic properties and adjoining areas including agricultural land into businesses with out planning permission when complaints are made and an enforcement officer all that happens is letters are written sugesting that they move and when an enforcement notice is given and a date for them to stop carrying out a business from a domestic property and them being threatened with court action if they do not do so enforcement officers do not carry out the threat and the unlawfull businesses continue nothing is followed up.  \nYou can now see in many country villages where  businesses are started up in domestic properties where small areas of land exists builders yards, contractors plant, scrap, containers, and building material all on agricultaural land  with out planning permission and frankly local government enforcement officers are not doing thier job and just not working to save the environment.\nFor this reason local enforcement officers should be answerable to an higher authority.",
