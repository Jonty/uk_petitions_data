        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Ever since duty was introduced on cider and Perry in the 70s there has been a small scale cider exemption in place.\n\nThis allows small scale producers to escape duty if they produce less than 70 hectolitres in a year. \n\nThis exemption was put in place to protect the rural producers for whom small scale cider/Perry production was part of their rural culture. \n\nCurrently it acts as an incentive for small scale producers to be given the opportunity to perfect their 'wares' without an onerous tax burden.\n\nThe EU Commission are setting up a working group to address special excise duty conditions relating to small scale industries this is likely to result in the removal of the exemption \n\nI petition the prime minister to instruct his ministers to resist this to ensure the diverse small cider producers in this country can continue to produce cider.\n\nIf the exemption is removed many small cider producers will cease production and a vital part of Great Britain\u2019s heritage will be lost forever.",
