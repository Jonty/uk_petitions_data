After slavery was outlawed throughout the Empire, the full might and resources of the Royal Navy was deployed to wipe out the slave trade in all British dominions and all British-controlled waters. the collapse of slavery throughout the world is in no small part due to the policies of the British Empire. We petition the Prime Minister to give his own country some kudos for that \n\nAs far as we are concerned, slavery is something that happened hundreds of years ago and something for which our country long ago made amends.",
