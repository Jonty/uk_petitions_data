Much like a piece of software it is neither given to government agencies, commercial organizations or survey bureaux: a limited (both in duration and rights) licence to use the information is issued.  The effect of giving licence power to the owner of the personal data (ie the person themself) and the consequent right to charge for its use, would put a price on mail-shots, cold-calling, and government data trawling.  It is only reasonable that if the information is owned by the person and access to it is of value to another body, that body should seek permission and pay for a licence to use the data.",
