            "background": "After the recent collapse of a Serious Fraud Office probe into bribery allegations in the arms industry many took comfort in the notion that at least this action was good for the creation of jobs. So if bribery is good for the economy why not legalise it? If bribery were legal we would be able to assess its net worth to the UK economy and compile an audit of its benefits. I therefore call on the Prime Minister to not only legalise corrupt payments but to appoint a Bribery Tsar. Our bribes must be cost effective. After all, other countries might bribe against us, costing British jobs. Britain needs to be equipped to compete in a global economy. We need a Bribery Tsar to prepare Britain for 21st century corruption and to make sure no child leaves school without bribery skills.",
