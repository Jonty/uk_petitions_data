        "background": "Tolls are being scrapped on the Erskine Bridge but will remain on the Tay and Forth bridges.\n\nIt is deeply unfair for both Dundee and Fife that a two-tier system of bridge tolling or not operates across Scotland. This inequality cannot be of any benefit to areas like Fife and Dundee who have been left with charges, while other parts of the country have seen these abolished. \n\nThis is also a very illogical situation and one that has the potential to damage local economies.",
