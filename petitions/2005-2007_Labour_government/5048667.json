            "background": "When the laws regarding marriage were put into place hundreds of years ago, nobody expected to live beyond the ripe old age of 40, and that was if they were lucky. \nSo, when they agreed to wed \"'til death do us part\" the term of the marriage would usually, in reality, only be 20 years max. \nWith people living longer, learning more and with the world being a much smaller place now, people, both men and women change in many more ways emotionally and intellectually. \nWe therefore suggest that the term of a marriage be put at 15 years. By doing this either partner can, at the 15-year point, end their marriage with no recriminations or stigma attached. If, at reaching 15 years, the partners are still happy then of course the term of contract can be reviewed and extended.\nTherefore a marriage can still be entered into but with the understanding that it is a fixed term contract and that either party can leave when the 15 years have been completed.",
