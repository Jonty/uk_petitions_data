            "background": "After the large lorries have come through the Channel Tunnel on the trains why can`t they be kept on them until they reach their UK destination ,instead of causing chaos on our motorways. When a train is unloaded at Folkestone or loaded there is a continual stream of lorries in the 1st and 2nd lanes of the M20 which is quite dangerous at rush hours, and this is only the southeast corner.",
