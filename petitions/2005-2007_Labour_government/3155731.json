            "background": "The UK early May (May 1 or thereabouts) Bank Holiday date frequently leads to the anomaly where we are working when most of the rest of the world is on holiday. And then we are on holiday a few days later when most of the world isn't. Given the increasingly global nature of much of UK business, this petition requests that the UK early May Bank Holiday date be revised to May 1 (regardless of day of week) for the sake of business effectiveness and efficiency.",
