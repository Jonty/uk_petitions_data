            "background": "Degrees of varying difficulty currenlty have no distinction between them (eg. surf studies and economics) and there is a limited number of higher grades that can be awarded per year. This seems vastly unfair if one graduates in a year of particularly gifted students and receives a 3rd when in other years this may have acchieved a 2:2 or 2:1. Surely there should be a more universally appropriate way of comparing levels of skill and acchievment that will give the degree back its value to employers.",
