A lot of government policy appears to be influenced by the media, when I vote for an MP or a party I expect them to act on their concience or the wishes of their constituents not what the press thinks is the order of the day. Remove these parasites of democracy from politics and make MP's accountable to the voters again. I voted for my local MP not the editor of the Daily Mail, so why does he seem to be running the country.",
