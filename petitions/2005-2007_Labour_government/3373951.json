            "background": "Under the Enterprise Act (2002), since 1 April 2004, a bankruptcy in England typically lasts no longer than 12 months.  Previously the discharge period would be typically 2-3 years.\nThis change has resulted in individual bankruptcies reaching record levels. In many cases bankruptcy is seen as an easy way out of debt. The more lenient penalty does little to deter people from borrowing beyond their means and talking responsibility for their own finances.",
