This is cost cutting and should stop.\nNew equipment should be built as it was   accepted at main gate and not have its   capabilities downgraded before commission. Penny pinching  in this fashion leaves equipment that either does not work, leaving costly equipment unable to accept midlife upgrades,  therefore costing more on the grounds it needs replacing early or worst still costing lives. \n\nAs members of the British Public we should expect the following:\nProper protection for our armed forces.\nthe Right to be able to trust our government to deliver the best equipment  for our men and women to use to defend this country and its people.\n\nplease support our armed forces\nthank you",
