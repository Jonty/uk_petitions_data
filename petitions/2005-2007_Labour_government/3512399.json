Rowling's Dumbledore, a much loved British story book character, is being greatly misrepresented on screen by Michael Gambon, to the consternation of the hundreds of millions of Harry Potter fans around the globe. Gambon, having never read a Harry Potter book, gives a fraudulent portrayal of Dumbledore, and has an annoying and inconsistent habit of pronouncing the odd word with an Irish accent. Please urge Warner Brothers to remove him.",
