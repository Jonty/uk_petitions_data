            "background": "I believe the Laws should be changed so that no person can drive a motor vehicle on the public highways without having first ridden a motorbike first for a period of at least one year.\nIntroducing this law will drastically reduce the amount of vehicular accidents occuring not only to Bikers but to other road user's and pedestrians as the level of awareness and concentration required to ride a motor bike is far greater than driving a car.\nIn addition to this insurance premiums will reduce as there would be less claims, polution of the environment would also reduce, death tolls will drop from reduced accidents occuring, the cost to the NHS and other public services will reduce and overall the population will benefit from a far greater awareness of road safety and therefore reduce the need for anymore speed camera scams",
