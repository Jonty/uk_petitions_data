SOME I HAVE URGED TO APPLY HAVE REFUSED BECAUSE THEY VALUE THEIR INDEPENDENCE AND PERCEIVE THESE CREDITS AS UNDIGNIFYING 'HAND-OUTS'.  SOONER THAN SACRIFICE THEIR SELF-ESTEEM, THEY CHOOSE TO SOLDIER VALIANTLY ON RATHER THAN FACE THE PROSPECT OF SUBMITTING DETAILS OF THEIR FINANCES TO THE INTRUSIVE SCRUTINY OF OTHERS. I AM FAMILIAR WITH THESE APPLICATION FORMS - THEY ARE LONG AND DAUNTING TO MANY.   PERHAPS IT IS THE INTENTION THAT FOLK SHOULD BE DETERRED FROM APPLYING FOR THESE CREDITS SO AS TO REDUCE PUBLIC EXPENDITURE.  IF SO, THIS IS VERY CYNICAL.  ARGUABLY, RELEVANT GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS ALREADY HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT INDIVIDUALS\u2019 FINANCES TO ASSESS WHETHER THEY NEED/QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL HELP.",
