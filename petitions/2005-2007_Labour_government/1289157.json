However the system checks if the user is in the UK and blocks the content if one is not. It would be a great service to UK citizens living and working abroad to have access to this content.\n\nIt could be done by linking ones passport number to a subscription or UK address where the TV licence is paid.\n\nthis would benefit the lives of many UK citizens living and working abroad and is technically possible at a minimal cost.",
