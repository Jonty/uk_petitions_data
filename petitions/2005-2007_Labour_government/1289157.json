        "background": "The BBC internet site enables the streaming of programs such as sporting events and certain TV shows over the internet. However the system checks if the user is in the UK and blocks the content if one is not. It would be a great service to UK citizens living and working abroad to have access to this content.\n\nIt could be done by linking ones passport number to a subscription or UK address where the TV licence is paid.\n\nthis would benefit the lives of many UK citizens living and working abroad and is technically possible at a minimal cost.",
