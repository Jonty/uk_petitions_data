        "background": "I am suggesting that all UK residents are given free dental treatment. Our country at the moment fails to provide millions of people with the denatl treatment they require. Our country is often mocked because of the lack of dental care given to those who either cannot get it or cannot afford it. Dental problems have a serious effect on health as numerous health studies over the years have shown. If you cannot eat properly you cannot expect to be healthy. Currently NHS dental treatment is a joke it is too expensive if you are lucky enough to find a practice that provides it. Dental hygiene is as important to improve as reducing obesity yet the government shows no interest in tackling this problem. I just want a nation of happy smiles not ashamed people with hands over their mouths.",
