This disregards the views of many others who do not choose to involve themselves in petitions, but whose opinions are equally important.\nOpinion polls attempt to take in to account the opinion of the whole population by using representative samples.\nHowever, although the government is obliged to listen to the public, they are also under an obligation to do what is best for the people. Sometimes looking at evidence based research may result in better decisions than listening to what people say that they want.",
