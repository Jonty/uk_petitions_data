Many factors can vary it. \nThe only safe option is not to drink if you plan to drive.\u201d*\n*Taken from government website \u2018THINK!\u2019 \u2013it shows it is not safe to drink-drive, yet the government has not banned it.\nWorking with young people makes me aware that many believe, because of the limit, up to the legal amount it is 100% safe to drive after having drunk alcohol. It isn\u2019t acceptable-please help show the government now!",
