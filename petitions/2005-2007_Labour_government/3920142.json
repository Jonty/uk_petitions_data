        "background": "I have just started an internet trading business, within 1 week I have received numerous emails from 7 different people who have all attempted to use internet scams by sending emails impersonating companies such as e bay Amazon and papal customised only by changing the name addressed to my name\n\nThis is just the tip of the iceberg, there are many hundreds of scams out there that I have found out have no policing method, even the most common bank scams.\n\nI contacted the police and to my amazement there is no such method of reporting email addresses or no effort at all to try and trace these people at all.  Even when I have verified email addresses that can be traced by internet service providers this information although actuate will not be looked at.\n\nIf there were a policing method for this internet crime would be less of a lucrative method of ripping thousands of innocent people off each year.\n\nby \n\nTrevor Cross",
