The amount of time this wastes, and the stress it causes, is incalculable.  It is obvious that firms are failing to employ switchboard operators as a method of reducing costs and thereby increasing profits; why should consumers have to pay, via increased telephone charges etc., for these reduced costs?  Some firms boast that their call centres are in this country rather than in India or wherever; we don't care where they are!  We just want them abolished and switchboard operators restored.",
