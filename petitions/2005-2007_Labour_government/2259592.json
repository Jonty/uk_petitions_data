            "background": "If you buy just about anything from a supermarket, you are likely to be puchasing \"empty space\". For example, a box of cereal bars about 14cm tall will contain plastic wrappers about10 cm tall, which contain the actual cereal bar at about 7cm tall. So when you buy this box of cereal bars 50% of it is empty space. What a con, but this could all be stopped in the name of reducing congestion. If the PM forced manufactures to fill boxes properly, then TWO lorry loads of cereal bars would fit into ONE lorry. A 50% reduction in commercial traffic on the road, less raod damage, less accidents, less queueing and honest consumerism. Vote for less traffic",
