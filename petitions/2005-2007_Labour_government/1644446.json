            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "While planning the heart of the 2012 Olympics it was decided London's most popular cycling facility, Eastway would have to go.\nEastway was London's only dedicated area for cycling both on and off road away the dangers of urban traffic. Used for cycle racing in many different formats, it was a treasure for those that wished to compete regularly in London.\nPlans were made and it was always promised that once the Olympics were over a new Velopark would be developed. This would restore the facility lost when Eastway was demolished.\nWhen this plan was revealed in January 2007, mountain bikers were shocked to see that it has no provision for any off road facility let alone the promised replacement mountain bike race circuit.\n\nPlease sign this petition to change this plan and reinstate the facility for all of London's dedicated and potential Olympian cyclists.",
