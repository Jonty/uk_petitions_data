            "background": "Many people and small businesses find themselves paying 'unlawful' bank charges when they go overdrawn, however many need not go overdrawn if the banking industry was made to speed up clearing times for the likes of cheques, electronic transfers and debit card transactions. \n\nAccording to a few sources - the UK is bottom of the league in Europe when it comes to banks processing customer payments. For example in Sweden, cheques clear in just a few hours and makes the data that people hold about their finances a lot more reliable and therefore easier to control.\n\nWe ask the Prime Minister to back a motion that would see the banking industry buck up its processes and move into the 21st century.",
