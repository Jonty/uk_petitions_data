            "background": "A submission has gone forward to Government from Peel Holdings to build the largest incinerator in Europe at Ince in Cheshire to burn waste from outside of the county, mainly from large cities. This is an already heavily polluted area with two major chemical sites and a massive oil refinery within close proximity to the proposed site. Incinerators never seem to be built in wealthy areas, only where the poor and already unhealthy people live. Please sign this petition in support to stop incinerators being built.",
