            "background": "Every year an estimated 700,000 people are trafficked into the UK for sexual exploitation, most of them women. These women are forcibly transported from their home countries so they can be exploited as enslaved workers, forced to do long hours of unpaid work, many of them are forced into prostitution by their 'owners', are not allowed to keep any of their earnings and are beaten if they refuse. \nEven if they manage to escape their captors, they are often too frightened to go to the authorites, and when they do they are more often than not treated as criminals themselves. This can mean deportation to their homeland where they will most likely be shunned by their own family or worse still fall back into the hands of the traffickers. \n\nIn order to protect these women the UK government (along with 9 other states) needs to sign the European Convention on Action Against Trafficking in Human Beings.",
