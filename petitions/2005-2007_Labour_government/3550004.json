            "background": "We were promised an enquiry regarding cadmium drop as to whether double the national average rate of oespaghus cancer in Norfolk is in any way attributed to it.  I myself am a victim of the cancer and as many as 6 people within \u00bd mile of the area I grew up in have either been affected or died of the same cancer which isn't hereditary. This amount can not be purley coinsidental.  As any mention of this is met with a deafening silence one is definately lead to believe there is a consipirency to hide the truth.",
