            "background": "Being a person who appreciates fine architecture and historical sites, I find that it is only fair that we preserve their beauty. I don't just mean the buildings themselves, I mean their surroundings too. However, I am aware that it would be quite difficult to get rid of any offices or factories that may be destroying the landscape, because we need these facilities to assist future generations. I do not, though, see this as an excuse to demolish the past that our ancestors have spent so long trying to create. Even though the buildings and sites still remain untouched, the land is still part of the past. Possibly the most beautiful creation in the world. I am sure that if you listen to this petition and take action, we will end up with a greener Britain and maybe even more tourists. Thank you.",
