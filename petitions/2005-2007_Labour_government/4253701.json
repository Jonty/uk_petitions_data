            "background": "Secondary schools commonly have more than 1,000 pupils.\nDisadvantages include:\n1. Inability of staff to recognize all pupils;\n2. Tendency of children to become isolated into age-groups;\n3. Likelihood of disruptive behaviour (the 'crowd' effect and accompanying anonymity);\n4. Longer travel, with the expense and effects on buses, trains & roads;\n5. Parents driving children to school;\n6. Pupils not walking to school;\n7. More stress on staff.\nThe benefits of smaller schools:\n1. Less travel for all;\n2. Walking exercise for pupils;\n3. Everyone relating better through the smaller numbers;\n4. Better behaviour, less stress;\n5. Pupils staying within their home locality.\n\nThe commission could be composed of experienced teachers, child and behavioural psychologists, environmental scientists and school governors.\nWe especially urge that the commission's  study would not be constrained by thoughts either about the cost of replacing current school buildings or about how to economically share facilities.",
