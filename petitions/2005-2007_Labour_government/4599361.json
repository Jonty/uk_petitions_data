Why are Bush & Blair so intent on spending vast amounts of their own nations' resources on some Middle East country? Surely they must be doing this because they know that they are getting something back in return? It's oil! Why doesn't Bush invade N. Korea? Because they have no oil! This whole state of events is a shambles and I want Mr. Blair to admit the truth - he wants oil not \"democracy\" and \"freedom\" for the Iraqis!",
