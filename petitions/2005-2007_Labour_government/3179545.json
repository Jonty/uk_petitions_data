            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Any dog is capable of biting.Banning breeds means that irresponsible owners will buy other breeds and be equally irresponsible.Dog owners should be educated and licensed(like car drivers).\n\nThe only advantage of BSL is in recognising that some breeds are harder to handle correctly,and should be kept only by competent people.Different license levels could reflect this(you cannot drive a lorry on a car license).No owner should object to proving they have the knowledge to look after their dog.\n\nBreeders should check that pup purchasers have the relevant license.This would reduce the number of people casually buying pups without being prepared to look after them\u2013if they needed to pass a test,they would be less likely to bother.\n\nThere should also be a license for people working with dogs.Poor trainers and irresponsible breeders make the problem worse.\n\nDog legislation should protect the public.Owner education and licensing will be more effective at this than breed specific measures.",
