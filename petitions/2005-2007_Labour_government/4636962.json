However, with so many ridiculous petitions on the site, it would be more representative to allow a \"petition against\" option.  If this site 'takes off' as I'm sure it will do, it will provide a powerful, if slightly skewed, gauge of public opinion.\n\nIt'd also be nice to be able to save your details, rather than having to type them in every time, but thats another issue!",
