Men may walk around topless in any public place while there is still much taboo/confusion regarding breasts. It is well-established that females may go topfree at places like beaches, parks and open air swimming pools but what about the rest of the time when it's absolutely ok for the lads? We ask for clarification and the right to walk topfree anywhere equally without fear of conviction.",
