            "background": "The Association of Chief Police Officers are to discuss plans to give ethnic minority and female candidates for the police preference over white, male recruits. \nThey have now changed the name of this process to make it more palatable from 'positive discrimination' to 'affirmative action'. The idea that our very own police force can practise discrimination on the grounds of race or sex is wrong. Every officer in the police force should be there because he or she is the best person for the job and not because of the colour of their skin. The majority of people in this country are happy to be dealt with by an Officer who is competent and professional absolutely irrespective of their race or religion.",
