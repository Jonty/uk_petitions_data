These are apprenticeships in everything but name and are at the lowest level paying as little as \u00a312,000 per annum. In areas where jobs are desperately needed this is a great blow and does not bode well for the future of training in this country. If the Government has no loyalty to the young people of this country what hope is there for our future?",
