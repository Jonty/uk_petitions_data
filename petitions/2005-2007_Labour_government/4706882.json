            "background": "Why should adults have to pay for the abolished child rates on buses, they already are taxed to until their wallets are empty, if they decrease these costs to a fair amount, this will reduce the cost of transport and could even solve the problem of congestion in and around london, there is also a possibilty it will reduce the polluiton within london and surrounding areas. Currently it has been worked out that it is actually cheaper to run a small economic car than to use buses 5 days a week to and from my work place. We need to see a drop in charges on public transport and the child rate re introduced as they are the ones that do the damage to buses and trains and the honest innocent tax paying citizens in london do not deserve to sit on seats covered in chewing gum, scratched windows that we cant look out and many other issues like such.",
