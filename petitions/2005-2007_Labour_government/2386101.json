            "background": "Lock up garages which are outside the curtilage of a property are not currently subject to Council Tax.   They dropped out of the tax system when domestic rating was abolished.\nThis places them in an unfair tax position in comparison with properties with integral garages where the garage valuation forms part of the Banding calculation.   This petition proposal restores the original status quo and redistributes the tax burden more farly",
