            "background": "I am asking that the Schools in this country be made to ban their teaching and encouragement of children getting involved in the Pagan practice of Halloween. This puts undue pressure on children to follow pears, so as not to be left out.\nThis practice opens up to them a pathway into the occult, and it should be down to the parents whether their children are involved in these practices.",
