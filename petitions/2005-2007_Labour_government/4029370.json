Combine this with the petition to remove Patricia Hewitt (2,700 signatures as I write) and the time for the appointment of a competent Secretary of State for Health is clearly overdue!",

            "background": "Whenever challenged Patricia Hewitt always points out that more money has been poured into the NHS.\nMaybe it has but the all party committee investigating out of hours medical cover concluded that the ONLY beneficiaries of the changes are GPs.\nThe MMC scheme has incensed doctors and, if it is as bad as reported, then those who dreamed it up should be dismissed.\nPatients are no longer treated in local hospitals but instead they (and their relatives) have to travel further afield - is this \"green\"?\nPFI is widely discredited as a very expensive way - over the longer term - of providing the NHS with facilities.\nFor how long can this \"shambolic\" show be allowed to stagger on?",
