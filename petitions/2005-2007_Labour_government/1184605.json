        "background": "I have long suffered, along with many people who have conditions such as cancer, heart disease, respiratory problems and transplant recipients, from extortionate travel insurance premiums, and inadequate policies based upon general risk assessment rather than looking at individual circumstances. One quote I had, was \u00a31200 for one week in Europe. I had a heart/lung transplant 13 years ago and am doing well. Many others have the same problem and we are being discriminated against due to a medical label. I have never travelled against the advice of my specialist. Far away destinations of my dreams are totally out of reach due to the cost of travel insurance. This is wrong!",
