            "background": "To allow kids from all backgrounds to be able to learn an instrument of their own choice.  Not only will it increase the amount of musical talent in the country it will allow for opportunities that most kids would have been unable to pursue in without the aid of the lessons from the Government.  The aim is that all Kids under the age of 16 are able to play an instrument of their choice for free as the government pays the tuition fee.  The lessons could be e.g. a group of 3-5 people per lesson and each class is split into a standard of ability.  They would be based at the children\u2019s schools and instruments would be either their own or the school may be donated instruments from the government.",
