For example Salisbury-Exeter, Hastings-Ashford could have nbeen doubled as was Bicester-Princes Risborough except that franchuses were curtailed to prevent it. Also franchises should redquire imporoved not curtailed services. It is NOT good enough for people to stand or be packed like sardines. Also note rail uses far less energy than road or air and rail can actually return energy",
