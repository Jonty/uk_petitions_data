        "background": "At present, some nursing staff are going home and returning in their work overalls. This is unhealthy. No-one knows where MRSA is coming from and it could be brought in by nursing staff who wear their work clothing in to the hospital/nursing home. Catering staff in our schools are compelled to leave their overalls behind when they finish work. The same should apply in our hospitals. Moreso because they are dealing with sick and vulnerable persons.",
