It's all great but there's a big piece of the jigsaw missing.\n\nThe gas Methane is ten (10) times more harmful than Co2 in it's effect in causing global warming.\n\nCattle produce a massive amount of methane each day. Coupled with a population all increasing their meat intake, how come this issue isn't being addressed as it should be.\n\nImagine 1.3 billion cattle each burping methane several times a minute, it doesn't require much more thinking to envisage the effect of that on our environment.\n\nThe Food & Agricultural Organisation of the United Nations have mentioned this but nothing had made it's way into mainstream media or the public.\n\nThis is a major contributor to global warming and it seems the government and the media are turning a blind eye to it. Why?",
