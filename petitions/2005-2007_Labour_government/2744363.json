Two 17 year old boys were killed and a further 17 year old boy seriously injured. There is an average of 1 person a month killed on a level crossing in the UK. 30% of these accidents are caused by vehicles hitting trains (Source: Network Rail 2007). Barriers would make these accidents less likely to happen. The financial cost of putting barriers in might be high - but can the Government even begin to put a price on a person's life?",
