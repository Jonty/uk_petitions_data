            "background": "We in the UK need a Government Fraud Department to handle Identity Theft and the Police to handle it as a criminal offence not a civil offence. The United States has a Fraud department that notifies credit reporting companies, stops collection of fraudulent debts and helps with the reporting to the police, the police issue and incident number. All at no expense to the victim. We need to follow their lead and actually help the victims  of this type of crime. Presently the Police do not help, the victim gets little help from companies demanding money only a large phone bill trying to sort out a mess they have little chance of controlling.\nPlease add your name to this petition it maybe our only chance of getting the government and police to act. Don't wait until you are a victim, Please sign the petition.",
