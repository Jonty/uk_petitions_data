            "background": "I believe there should be a seperate driving test for those people (anybody) who wishes to tow a caravan/trailer of any variety to have to take responsibility and pass a valid driving test. Just as a driver with HGV/LGV has too as does a bus/coach driver, those drivers who use trailers/caravans should, by law, have to hold a suitable licence. There are too many instances where drivers 'pulling' a trailer or caravan seem oblivious to the laws which confine their road speed and indeed position.",
