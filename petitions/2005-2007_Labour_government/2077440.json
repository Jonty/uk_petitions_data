            "background": "Road pricing offers the most realistic approach to both reducing the carbon emissions from vehicles in Britain, and to improving traffic flow.  If tackled appropriately it should be fiscally neutral and potentially redistributive.  It will make necessary journeys more reliable and faster.  It offers the opportunity for big improvements to both the price and availability of public transport for all and to air quality in cities which is known to damage the health of many, especially the young and old.  It would enhance the quality of the lives of many of our poorest and most vulnerable people, especially children.",
