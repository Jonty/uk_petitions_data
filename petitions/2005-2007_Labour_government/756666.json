            "background": "The Earth's climate has been regularly changing between extremes of heat and cold for the past million years (Britain has had vast glaciers and also tropical flora and fauna resident during this time). Humans may be influencing the current interglacial warming, but ultimately change will occur and to think that we can halt the change is arrogance, ignorance and/or short term political initiatives based on fear. Humans have evolved over the past violent climate shifts by ADAPTING to such change. This is what should be concentrated on - adaptation to the new situations, not pathetically following the advice such as that given to King Canute. Climate change WILL happen \u2013 concentrating on reducing carbon footprints at this point is futile and distracts from the real issue. Technological, sociological and scientific approaches will enable adaptations to be made to society to pre-empt the negative consequences of these inevitable changes in a dynamic climate.",
