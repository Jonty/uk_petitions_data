            "background": "Last week, it was reported that ITV was in \"advanced negotiations\" with distributor Fremantle to snatch the australian soap 'Neighbours' from the BBC, and considering paying \u00a380,000 an episode to acquire the soap. \n\nThe BBC has called Fremantle's demands \"unrealistic and greedy\", after its offer of around \u00a370,000 an episode was rejected. The BBC currently pays \u00a325,000 an episode for the soap.\n\nBBC director of acquisitions George McGhee told Broadcast: \"If a deal is not reached in the very, very near future, we will withdraw the money and move it elsewhere. We quite possibly will [move it by the end of this week].\" \n\nI urge you to help keep this tv institution on the BBC that has supported it so well for over 20 years. ITV is far more interested in ratings grabbing and will not give the programme the support it deserves.  Don't let ITV ruin a relationship the programme has had with its viewers and the BBC for over 2 decades! Sign the petition now!",
