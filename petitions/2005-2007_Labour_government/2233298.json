In anticipation of Prince Charles's reign as King, and in an effort to support him in this position, we urge him to regrow the moustache once sported in 1974.  \nSo that Charles may be at ease to gather support for the principles for which he stands, it is only right that this facial feature be returned and with it the authority and kingship that it brings. \nWe plead with the Prime Minister to support us in this, in the interests of good government and the secure future of our nation.",
