        "background": "Tolls, whatever they are called, are a most inefficient tax that is very expensive to collect and enforce.\n\nTolls don't encourage fuel economy, and lead to more wasted time, fuel and increased emissions as drivers queue to pay or detour on to less suitable roads\n\nAll road users are very heavily taxed, and tolls are an added unjust burden that particularly hits drivers on low incomes.\n\nCongestion is caused by almost none of the existing tax going back into better roads such as - bypasses round towns and villages, multi level junctions, tunnels in urban areas, and extra lanes on motorways.",
