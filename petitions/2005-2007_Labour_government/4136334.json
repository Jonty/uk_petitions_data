            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "For those that do not know the difference, a Hackney vehicle is a taxi that can load off the street, and Private Hire is a taxi that has to be pre-booked from an office over the telephone. At the moment, a Hackney is a vehicle that can load off the street, whilst also being allowed to undertake private hire bookings, this in essence allows a far greater earning potential in a local authority restricted area for the Hackney owner. Whilst in contrast the Private hire owner can ONLY load from a pre-booking, and therefore loses revenue to the Hackney market. Please sign this if you feel that the two sectors should be clearly divided, NOT allowing hackneys to work on private hire companys in areas where the local council have a capping limit on hackney vehicle numbers.",
