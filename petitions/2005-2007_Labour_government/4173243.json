        "background": "This petition requests that Tony Blair stop appearing on any quiz programmes, comedy sketches, chat shows or other light entertainment programming, and get on with the more important task of running the country. People are beginning to get bored with attempts to get 'down' with 'the kids' like his recent Catherine Tate sketch for comic relief. We wouldn't be allowed to bunk off our jobs to go on Richard and Judy, and we didn't elect Tony Blair to do it either.",
