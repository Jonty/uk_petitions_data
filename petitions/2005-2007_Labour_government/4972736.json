He had just started a new job at nissan and had a wonderful family. This is not the first time someone has been killed at this beauty spot. His whole family is devastated by his lost. We do not want this to happen to another family and wish for railings to be placed at the water fall to stop people from been to adventurous. So we can stop further deaths or serious injuries please sign this petition.",
