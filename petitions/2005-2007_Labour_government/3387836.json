        "background": "The Oyster cards can be used on buses, whose routes end outside London. These destinations should be the edge of the Oyster use area, for all services, especially above ground trains. Young people over 16 are penalised, by the extremely expensive fares, for using the trains when travelling into London from the surrounding area. Why should young people pay excessive fares for using public transport, as the government has requested?",
