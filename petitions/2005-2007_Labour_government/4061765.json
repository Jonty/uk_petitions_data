Based on the current budget UK Businesses are going to see virtually no increase in revenue as a result.\n\nTherefore we ask Prime Minister Blair to intervene with this loss of control / spending to stop this spending spiralling further out of control.  \n\nThe revised budget of \u00a310bn equates to the population of the UK (whether 8months old or 80 years) paying \u00a383 each.\n\nSurely this revised budget could be better spent on the NHS / Public Transport infrastructure/ Education.",
