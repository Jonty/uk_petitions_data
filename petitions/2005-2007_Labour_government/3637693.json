        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Anyone can ask for a caveat to be entered to stop a suspect document continuing through Probate as a valid Will. The person applying for Probate may issue a \"warning\" against it.\nUnscrupulous people and solicitors can wait for the caveator to go on holiday then enter a warning to the caveat. After 8 days the caveat is removed as no response is received.\nThe caveator might also wish to seek legal advice that may take longer than 8 days,  especially as the rules surrounding caveats and warnings are not well known. As people frequently go on holiday for 2 or 3 weeks it is sensible to make the period longer so they have a chance to maybe return from holiday and/or seek legal advice.",
