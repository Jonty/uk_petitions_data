            "background": "Our current time system contributes to global warming by creating greater carbon emissions. This is because early morning daylight is wasted for half the year whilst we need lights on in the evening. Lighter evenings would mean more could be done outdoors and children are also safer during daylight hours, of which there would be more after school. Furthermore, we'd all save money by moving clocks forward with lower electricity bills. What most commentators do not suggest however, is that clocks should not be adjusted twice a year. Aside from depressingly dark evening that this suddenly creates in the autumn, the time wasted is enormous - just add up how many clocks there are in your  house, car, office etc.",
