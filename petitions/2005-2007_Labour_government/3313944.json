            "background": "as you you probaly have already guessed no one wants the road taxing to go ahead, and i also think road pricing and vehicle tracing should not go ahead because i think its wrong. driving is a luxury and for most people and a important,\nintegral part of most peolpes working life we already pay enough for using the roads with car insurance and the cost of petrol aint cheap either.\n\nmost of all you got to remember that introducing this method is unethical and not entirely fair on citisons, also not everyone will be able to afford it and the less wealthy people who rely on there cars to get to work and there jobs are far from where they live will be affected the most because u are cutting there means of transport.\n\nthere are many reasons i could write down for being against this policy but i think you get the idea, i think you should not go ahead with vehicle tracking and road pricing policy but improve the roads to a better standard to reduce traffic build up.\n\nby john deakin.",
