This is clearly illegal and should not be tolerated.\n\nWe must bring them back using almost any means at our disposal.  The only things that should not be tried are those things that would appease the criminals responsible.  We should be firm and courageous and make sure that they never try it again.\n\nThe colleagues of the kidnap victims must be sick with worry and wrought with frustration that they were not allowed to stand up and protect them.  Our armed forces need to know that they can do their job knowing that the country is behind them and they will be protected.",
