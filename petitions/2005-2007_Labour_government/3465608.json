The 2012 Olympics are an irrelevant, obscenely costly corporate shindig unwanted by the majority of the population, for the benefit of a select few. Costs have so far quadrupled to date, a hallmark of govt. projects which would be tolerated in no other area, and will doubtless do so again over the next  two years. Either accurately and honestly account for this waste of public funds or, more realistically, drop the event.",
