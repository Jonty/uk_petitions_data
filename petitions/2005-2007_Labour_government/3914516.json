            "background": "Having worked has cover supervisors for over a year, we now know how difficult and demanding this role is.  We are disappointed that although we are in full class control (behaviour, delivering lessons, aiding learning, aiding pupils - all the same responsibilities of teaching staff) we are paid the same level as Teaching Assistants that support in the lessons we are responsible for and are woefully underpaid compared to supply teachers although assuming the same responsibilties. This is not fair when a supporting role, or other teaching roles, does not equate. Please sign our petition so we can get proper recognition and renumeration for the job we do.",
