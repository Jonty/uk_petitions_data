            "background": "There is rising concern about the treatment given to psychiatric patients. Being under the control of psychiatrists, patients can suffer abuse.\nThis abuse can take the form of physical mistreatement, force,  made to comply, raped, or given unnecessary drugs to keep them 'quiet'.\n\nAbuses can and do occur. For too long psychiatrists have been above the law for whatever they did with patients was described as treatment.\n\nThe pm is requested to:\n\n1. Setup independant mechanisms to fully investigate all psychiatric abuse: \n (a)adhoc visits to hospitals, institutions and offices, by investigators\n (b)investigation of all reported abuse.Details to be published on the internet\n\n2. Report to the House, on an annual basis, statistics on\n (a)deaths of people while in psychiatric care\n (b)findings of adhoc visits to hospitals, institutions and offices\n (c)numbers of psychiatrists investigated, charged and struck off.\n\n3. Stop using psychiatrists as expert witnesses.",
