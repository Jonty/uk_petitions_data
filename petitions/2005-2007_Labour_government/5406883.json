            "action": "to seek a reform of the House of Lords in which all members are appointed but they will have limited powers unless their membership is endorsed by winning an election in competition with other appointed members.   In particular all members will be able to speak in debates but their membership would need to be endorsed if they wanted to vote.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are advantages to both appointed and elected membership of a reformed House of Lords, but general agreement on the best proportions of appointed and elected members is unlikely.  Actually the benefits of appointed and elected membership are so different that the concept of balancing one set against the other is misguided.\n\nIn this plan it is envisaged that about 750 members will be appointed on the basis of an established track record in public service, commerce, industry, and academia etc.  These appointed \u201clords\u201d will be able to contribute their wealth of knowledge and experience in debates.  In order to vote in the Lords, members will need to be endorsed in an election in which only appointed members of the House can stand.  It is envisaged that there will be about 250 special electoral constituencies, so if members wish to vote they will be competing with about three other members for this privilege.  This endorsement will provide the democratic authority with which to scrutinise and check where necessary the activities of the House of Commons.",
