        "background": "The petition mechanism is not a service traditionally extended by our goverment to the public, it acknowledges that the public are better informed and connected than in previous eras.\n\nCertainly some of the more complex decisions, or acts, of parliment may be facilitated by a popular vote, although it should be obvious that the 'popular vote' cannot replace final decisions by the elected representatives of the people. However allowing this more immediate popular feedback on every important parlimentary decision may show the way towards a more efficient democratic process.",
