            "background": "The government says that they want to address climate change, encourage us to use public transport and drive less, why then does public transport often prove to be more costly than driving? London has by far the most expensive underground system in the world, with or without an oyster card and buses nationwide are also very highly priced. How can this form of transport be for the public when big bosses are allowed to earn huge amounts of money? Is the government prepared to give us a real alternative to driving?",
