            "background": "The so called GREEN excuse to double the air passenger duty makes me sick to my stomach to know that this government can get away with Lying to the people. How dare this government double a duty claiming it is a GREEN tax when they have no intention to use the extra revenue for such an important purpose. The Renewable Energy Association provides grants to the people of this country to have wind turbines and solar panels for their homes and businesses in effect saving them money on fuel bills and also cutting carbon emissions at the same time! This government could not care less about the planet. A green tax to help recover the billions spent on a war to secure the oil in iraq that will when used pollute the planet further is more likely the real story behind this latest Brown Tax Paradox.",
