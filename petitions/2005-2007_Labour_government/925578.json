        "action": "Ensure the understanding and meeting of Asperger children / students' needs within the UK education system",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Take the case of: A student with Aspergers (aged 19), drops 2 A levels but is still studying hard for 2 A levels at college (they were completely failed by the UK education system, and their education thus delayed) now has their transport to college withdrawn because they are not studying a \"full-time\" course. The student is working hard but due to nature of AS can cope with \"only\" 2 A levels at one time. (\"Inclusion\" caused intolerable stress and just made them more aware of their \"difference\".) This bombshell dropped yesterday. Is this right? Does this encourage this person to educate themselves? Should not this Government be ashamed of what those with Aspergers and their parents / carers have to endure from the education system?",
