            "background": "The rich contribution that UK children\u2019s television makes to popular culture needs to be valued and protected. ITV has already chosen to stop commissioning new children\u2019s content and the BBC acknowledge that since the licensing review children\u2019s production will be seriously affected. The cost of making quality tv with high production values is rising especially in the new High Definition format. The Ofcom junk food ad ban also affects the level of money available for new shows and the ability of companies like ITV to commission new work. While there is material in the short-term, the supply of new programmes may run out in about 18 months to 2 years - the time needed to develop a quality show. So the way is wide open for cheap, unregulated imports. We need to protect children\u2019s tv and develop a new funding structure to provide a competitive UK marketplace.  We do not want to end up with inferior shows made just to sell toys.",
