Yet his father has had nothing to do with him since he was 9 months old still has the right to say if he can change his name to my surname, if he can have a passport. I feel he should not have a say in his life as he does not know his son yet as parent responsibility. How can someone have a right to say what my son does when he has not seen him in over 10 years, so after not seeing him for so long should lose any rights as my son is affected as he wants nothing to do with his real father.",
