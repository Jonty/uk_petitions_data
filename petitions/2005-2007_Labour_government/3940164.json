            "background": "The \u00a3352million Highways Agency scheme, which is unlikely to start for at least seven years, aims to improve road safety and journey times for drivers travelling to and from the South-West.\n\nThe proposal to place a flyover in the Blackbrook playing fields is mad. This should not be allowed as it would affect the health of residents as well as removing much needed green space. It is not necessary as part of the dual carriage way scheme. \n\nThe Government gave support in 2004 to the dualling of the A358 rather than the A303 across the environmentally sensitive Blackdown Hills.\n\nThis proposal will vastly increase the noise levels and will have a significant financial impact on local resident housing values including mine. On top of which, the disruption to local wildlife and existing leisure facilites are also high.",
