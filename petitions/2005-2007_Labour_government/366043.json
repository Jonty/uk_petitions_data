Companies could still choose to do this but must pay a penalty to the social security funds of a minimum of \u00a310k per year for each offshored job. So if a webdesigner for example is not available in the UK then it would be ok to offshore that role. This should not be a matter of simple economics because eventually when all the jobs, skills and candidates have gone who will be available to buy the services or products these faceless companies provide.",
