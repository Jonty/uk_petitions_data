            "background": "Region Coding is enforced by the playback hardware, such as DVD players and video games consoles, based on the region the device is sold in (ie: Region 2 for Europe) and the region defined on the medium, set by the distributor, based on where it shall be distributed.\n\nThe effect is a limitation on free trade and import, which allows distributors of media to charge an uncompetitive sum of money, higher in the United Kingdom (and Europe) than worldwide counterparts with no competition.\n\nRegion coding prevents fair use and enjoyment of products bought in a different territory and promotes price discrimination and is a massive unfair barrier to free trade, something the UK and EU firmly believe in.\n\nWe believe the Prime Minister should stand up for free market capitalism, outlaw a practice that may fall in he category of price fixing, and allow Britons the chance to purchase digital media at a fair and competitive price, free of geographically imposed restrictions.",
