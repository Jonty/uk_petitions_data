        "background": "Whilst our current national anthem has served us well for some time, we feel that it's time for a change.\n\nIdeally - we would like \"When I'm Cleaning\" windows to be the new tune, as it represents all that is good about Great Britain.\n\nIt's chirpy and represents the brighter side of life and we feel that it would make people feel much better about themselves.\n\nAlso, at large events (football matches and so forth) it truly would be great to hear tens of thousands of people singing passionately and I feel it would inspire our sports teams to greater success.",
