Whats the difference between a 24 and 25 year old?\n\nCouncils refuse to house single homeless people and then complain why there is so much crime in their areas. These people need a roof over their head and some may resort to crime in order to survive and feed themselves.\n\nAs we all know you cannot claim benefit unless you have a permananent adresss. \n\nPlease sign.",
