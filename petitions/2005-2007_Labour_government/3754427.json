I now call on you Mr.Tony Blair in your capacity of Prime Minster to bring home all our Armed Forces in Afghanistan and Iraq. It is painfully clear to most of us that whatever you were trying to achieve you aren't and the pointless loss of these service people is totally unacceptable. Please call them all home now and let the people of the invaded countries get on with their lives in the way their leaders see fit.",
