        "background": "Assume the average UK salary is \u00a325,000\n\nTax is charged at 22%, which costs \u00a35,500.\n\nNational Insurance is charged at 10%, which costs \u00a32,500\n\nAssume that the average car does 30 mpg, the average mileage is 12,000 per year - i.e. 400 gallons of fuel per year.\n\n400 gallons @ \u00a35 each is \u00a32,000, of which \u00a31,600 (or thereabouts) is tax.\n\n\u00a35,500 + \u00a32,500 + \u00a31,600 = \u00a39,600\n\n\u00a39,600 is approx 38% of \u00a325,000.\n\nLeaving aside the fact that the \u00a31,600 fuel tax is from net pay, the effective tax rate is at least 38%.\n\n(Granted, the calculation does ignore the 0% and 10% bands - but, in fairness, it also ignores council tax).\n\nWe the undersigned say \"enough already; stop increasing our taxes; make the public sector more efficient so it no longer requires endless increases in our taxes to pay for it\"",
