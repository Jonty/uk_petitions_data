            "background": "Why is it that we are loosing jobs to poor states, due to it being cost effective for these major corporations, why is it, most partys take back handers from corporations and international bankers.  I ask you why is it, this so called freedom of speech, means more like freedom of control in our society, define terror to us, who is terrorising who here? did we have ID cards in london?.\nYou want to charge for excess rubbish, but support products being made from other nations like china and the other asian states, that WILL use fuel and non-degradable packaging which causes damage to our enviroment. Do you know what i see, double standards, hidden lies and spin.  Its time we had in power people who serve US the british people for a change, and not the banks and corporations that pay you politicians to hold your conferences, its just spin spin and more spin.\nGet a grip, we are not as foolish as you think, its time for a democratic revolution here, and the world over!",
