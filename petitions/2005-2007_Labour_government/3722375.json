        "background": "The people of Hull and the surrounding area have no choice when it comes to telecommunications provider. We are forced to become customers of Kingston Communications if we require a land line telephone or an internet connection. We are unable to take advantage of competitive deals and offers provided by other companies, such as free broadband connections from Sky. We resent being subject to such a monopoly. We demand the right to choose.",
