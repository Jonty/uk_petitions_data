            "background": "It has been announced that the next National Railway Timetable, to be published in a few weeks will be the last.\n  This timetable has been published for many years, and includes details of all services on the national rail network, and some details of private railways and tram systems.\n\n  Ceasing publication seems a thoroughly retrograde step.\n  Many people have bought each edition for many years, and make frequent use of it.\n  There is nothing wrong with timetables being available online, nor with having a telephone service, but if one wishes to plan trips or study services, the full printed NR timetable is indispensable.",
