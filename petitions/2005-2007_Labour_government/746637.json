            "background": "As widely reported in the press (Telegraph, 5th Jan 2007) we no longer have the assets nor capability to defend the Falklands, nor effectively support allies in Afganistan, Iraq and in our other commitments including peace keeping duties and anti-drugs and hurricane support role in the Caribbean. \nOn 4 Jan 07 the MoD stated it would reduce its operational force to 25 warships with vessels being scrapped or held in mothball status at up to 18 months readiness.\nThis petition does not seek to re-establish the UK a large global military power.\nA funding level of 4.5% GDP is less than that spent at the time of the Falklands war in 1982 (~5%) but well below recent peaks (5.3% in 1986). It would, however, provide the funds necessary to undertake our current levels of commitment without over-stretch, provide the necessary equipment to protect personnel and provide those overseas personnel returning to UK with barracks not of \"near-squalor\" conditions (Telegraph, 5th Jan 2007).",
