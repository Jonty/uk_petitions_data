        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Due to the size, capacity and placement of diesel fuel tanks on large vehicles they are often filled to the brim and capped with poorly fitting caps which leak diesel on the carriageway on every bend and roundabout within a few miles of being filled.\nThe resulting unexpected skid can be quite scary in a car but is often catastrophic on a motorcycle.\nEvery motorcyclist knows someone who has lost control due to diesel spills and far too many know of someone who has died as a result of a diesel user who couldn\u2019t be bothered to think of others.\nPlease sign this to encourage the government to make these drivers think of others.",
