            "background": "Due to the fact that a large percentage of the country is being trapped into debt by bank accounts/credit cards giving clients much more money than they can afford to pay back, I move that this free loan economy be outlawed for our own protection. The current situation only leaves the poor much poorer and the banks unreasonably profiteering from the populous' greed for the have-it-now culture we live in. Credit is leading to mental anguish of the bankrupt and is damaging for the country.",
