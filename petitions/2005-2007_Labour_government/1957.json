            "background": "It is becoming far too common that Police officers find themselves under the attack from armed criminals. When faced with such a high threat the Police can only fall back on the current defensive equipment (batton and Pava sprays). \n\nAsk yourself this; If you were confronted by someone with a knife or worse, wouldn't you like to have more than a metal stick or a chemical spray (that takes approx 10 seconds to take effect) to protect yourself and others around you.\n\nBy issuing our Police with taser devices they would be able to protect themselves and the public without risking anyone's life.",
