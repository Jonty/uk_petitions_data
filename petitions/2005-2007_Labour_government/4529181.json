There isn't another bank holiday until August and no more til Christmas. People would love more bank holidays and have them more spaced out. To make Britain in line with the European average we need 10 Bank Holidays. If We had ten  then it would be as follows.  Jan 1st, Jan 2nd(Like Scotland) Good Friday, Easter Monday, May Day, Queens Birthday in June instead of Spring Bank at the end of May  (Like in Austrialia) August, October (To give us a break before winter set in)Christmas Day and Boxing Day.  2 Extra Bank Holidays I would like the Prime Minister to look in to it for the British Public",
