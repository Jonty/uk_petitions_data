            "background": "We the undersigned believe that this government has abandoned common sense and sound morality and has run after the views of focus groups who's views are diametrically opposed to the majority view of the British public. We also believe that they go about almost everything they do in a heavy handed and punitive way which dehumanises anyone on the recieving of their pedantic legislation. We believe that the title 'Labour Party' no longer represents the essence of what the party stands for, and is highly misleading, so we believe that the term 'Morally Bankrupt Party' describes it much better on the grounds that a vast amount of what they have done while in power has been morally bankrupt. We ask the Prime Minister to change the name of the 'Labour Party' to the 'Morally Bankrupt Party' as soon as it can be done in order not to mislead the British public any longer.",
