            "background": "I think drugs are great\nIf they were legalised then the crime surrounding them would not be a problem, and if the governement grew them for us then people wouldn't exploited by drugs smugglers in other countries. We could have a minimum age which would vary depending on the drug. Physically addictive drugs like heroine would still be banned but hopefully no-one would use them because they could buy other drugs. Plus it would create extra income for the government because they could be a small drug tax.",
