We would like to see a fairer system where we the public are able to have an extra box stating \u2018I cast my vote as a U.K. citizen and do not wish to support any party above\u2019.  We would like to see this vote publicly published therefore giving a proper insight into our country\u2019s political views rather than the one\u2019s usually banded around in the media e.g. \"it was raining on election day!\" this being an excuse because we the public have had no faith in any party for many decades.  Also we would like it made law that every UK citizen is legally required to vote like our counterparts in Australia.",
