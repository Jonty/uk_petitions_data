This will tie in with the government's ideas of rehabilation by offering the criminals who very often have committed their crime through a lack of daily structure and restore them with a sense of pride. It will be the convicted's choice but should they choose the army and then re-offend, they will be out of the civil legal system and will be dealt with in a military court-a deterrent in itself- so there may be a decrease in re-offending. now has structure and focus in his life.Of course in this climate, it would be necessary to allow the convicted to have the choice as without it, an underhand enforcement of the death penalty could take place. This is the answer to Britain's overcrowded prisons.",
