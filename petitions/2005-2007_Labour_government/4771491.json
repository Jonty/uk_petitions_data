            "background": "It's a disgrace that in 2007, nightclubs are allowed to practise blatent sexual discrimination in their entry policy. Having just received a notice from a local nightclub which offers FREE entry all night for women, but charges \u00a310 for men, I don't understand how this is permitted when we have laws outlawing sexual discrimination in every other aspect of our lives. If a venue were to charge different prices for entrants of different colours or religions, they would be prosecuted, yet this discrimination seems to be accepted as perfectly normal nationwide, despite all the legislation in place against such nonsense. I don't go to a restaurant & see meals listed at one price for men & another for women, or go to a cinema & get charged more for my ticket than a woman. Why is such obvious discrimination, based purely on gender, allowed to continue?",
