        "background": "It is well reported that the canteens and bars supplying food and drink, including alcoholic beverages, to MPs and other employees in the halls of government do so at reduced prices.  \nThis is only possible because money being taken from taxpayers is used to subsidise the cost - growing numbers of those very taxpayers are sometimes unable to feed themselves, or cannot afford to 'go out to the pub for a drink' because of the inexorable increases in taxation levied against the UK population by this government - and the taxes they pay should not be used to provide food and booze on the cheap to already overpaid public servants and politicians.",
