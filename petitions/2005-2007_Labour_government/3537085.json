            "background": "Each day we use skincare products that we think are safe,but these products aren\u2019t always safe and manufacturers don't have to tell us.Most products contain many harmful chemicals that havent been tested for human safety.The problem with this is that a huge amount of skincare ingredients are absorbed through the skin,which could result in severe health problems:\n\nSODIUM LAURYL SULFATE used in garage floor cleaners and in 90% of products that foam.Animals exposed to SLS experience eye damage,central nervous system depression, severe skin irritation and even death. \n\nPARABENS are chemical preservatives that disrupt the systems of gland-secreted hormones that orchestrate much of the body's functions and growth.\n\nPHTHALATES are reproductive and developmental toxicants and are thought to disrupt the endocrine system causing reduced male and female fertility and foetal toxicity.\n\nFRAGRANCE on a label can indicate the presence of up to 4000 separate ingredients,many toxic or carcinogenic.",
