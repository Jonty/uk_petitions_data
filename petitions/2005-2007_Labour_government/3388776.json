            "background": "In the last few months there has been an increase in the number of violent deaths amongst young people - stabbings, shootings and suicide (as a result of bullying). In February UNESCO published a report that compared UK very unfavourably with other countries in terms of the well-being of young people. \nAre these two  issues connected? Teachers report an increased tendency towards violence amongst children, even in schools for infants - it is not, therefore, surprising when violence gets out of control in the teenage years. \nWe need to recognise the wake-up call to change the underlying culture of violence that is emerging in UK. This requires initial debate, followed by concerted action in which everyone is involved (parents, teachers, community and media). A good start might be to examine honestly what so many of our neighbours seem to do much better than we do - raise happy, non-violent young people.",
