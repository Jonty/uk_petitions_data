            "background": "It seems that not enough is being done to protect children from peadophiles,a prison sentence,and the help of do gooders is not enough.\nIf you can't control your sexual urge,then it should be taken away.\nChemical castration is the only answer.and if ministers pity the abusers more then their young victims.then they are sending out the message that to abuse children is ok.\nOr the powers that be in our country are protecting themselves from a more active sentence of castration.\nSarah's law should have massive backing from our ministers ,but is it?\nEvery caring parent should back this petition,for the sake of all the young babies upwards.",
