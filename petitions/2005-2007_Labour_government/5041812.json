            "background": "The minimum possible punishment for those caught stealing bandwidth (e.g. from a WiFi network) should be increased. If a person manages to use your internet connection without permission it is possible for them to steal personal information from your computer and access illegal websites. Should someone visit an illegal website it will be traced back to internet connection used and as a result it will be the owner of the connection who will be questioned and have their computer confiscated.",
