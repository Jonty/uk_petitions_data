            "action": "stop funding for inappropriate buildings in Central Leeds, and ask for a mass transport system, namely that which is under ground and does not visually pollute an increasingly visually-neglected Leeds",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In recent years, Leeds has gone from being a pleasant and well-reputed Northern city, the largest outside London, to one whose skyline is now dominated by hideous cranes, (unoccupied) apartments and unnecessary architecture. This has boosted an out-of-nowhere ego of Leeds being the best thing since sliced bread, and a compact version of London, despite the Pennines landscape hindering it. Yet the government is prepared to allow these monstrous buildings to spring up and will not concentrate on the real Leeds people, who are being swept aside, and who urgently need a working transport system that is efficient and not overpriced, and at the same time will not pollute the city visually: it needs to go underground; a tube system. So give Leeds something it really deserves to bring back its Yorkshire-ness and unite communities. The benefits would be reduced congestion, journey times and pollution, a REAL way of modernising Leeds, and potential for expansion for all of the West Riding.",
