            "background": "Stanley park in Liverpool belongs to the people of Liverpool and should remain a green space. The council should not be allowed to betray the citizens of Liverpool and sell off this green space to a commercial body, the commercial body being Liverpool football club. If, however, the council is allowed to proceed with this sell off, then the remainder of Stanley park should be donated to Everton football club, to redress the balance and show that the council is not (as it appears) biased towards Liverpool football club.",
