            "background": "Smoking will be with us forever, regardless of legislation or social policing. Workers are already restricted to 'going outside' to smoke. Health issues of smoking aside, going outside in cold and wintery conditions can cause additional health problems, resulting in loss of hours worked and production. Total smoking bans on premises just cause resentment amongst smokers, and encourage finding a 'sly corner to have a fag'. An internal enclosed shelter (smokers tea-room?) with smoke extraction is not beyond the means of most companies, and would create a fairer and more balanced approach for those who do smoke and those who don't.",
