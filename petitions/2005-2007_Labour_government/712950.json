        "background": "Since 1973 the UK has been sucked dry, bullied, hassled and controlled by the EU.  Very little law that the UK passes originated in the British Elected House of Commons.  Furthermore, the EU laws that the UK adopts (usually forced to adopt)are often taken to far by the UK Government.  In just 3 years time it will be an offence to use feet, pounds (if not \u00a3 by then)and gallons in the UK.  Thanks to The United States of Europe.  Look at the EU Euro zones economy, it's failing, do we want that in the UK?  Lets stop the unelected, unaccountable busy bodies in Brussels telling we British what to do, and while we are at it lets re-introduce border controls and passport stamps for non UK citizens entering the UK from the EU.",
