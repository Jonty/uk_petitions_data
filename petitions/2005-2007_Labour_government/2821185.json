            "background": "During the 1970s, millions of schoolchildren tuned in to the educational science TV programme \"How?\". Of the four presenters (who can forget the marvellous Jack Hargreaves), it was Fred Dinenage who injected the fun into answering scientific questions. Many of today's leading scientists will have gained their initial inspiration from Fred, and it would therefore be fitting for a modest bronze bust of the great man to be installed just inside the entrance (on the left) to The Science Museum in London. \n\nVisitors could honour Fred as they bought their tickets by putting their hand in the air and saying \"How?\".",
