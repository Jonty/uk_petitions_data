        "background": "This petition aims to make Sunday the new Friday.\n\nSunday is often perceived as the most lackluster day of the week, a day when people feel de-motivated because they know they have to go to work the next day.\n\nContrast this with Friday, a day when most working people of Britain are on high spirits following a long hard week at work.\n\nGiven these two differing days of the week, would it not be better to start the working week with as much enthusiasm and motivation as is given to the end of the week at present?",
