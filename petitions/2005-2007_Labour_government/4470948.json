            "background": "Get tougher on pubs and shops who serve children as young as 14 by closing them down.Make sure Licencing officers are around during opening times not 9 to 5.\nHelp the police keep drunkeness of the streets by closing pub who break the laws on obsesive drinking.(serving people who have had too much already)Do something about the situation of false I.D purchased over the internet.Give positive feedback to those who run their pubs correctly.Here in Peter Hain's town of Neath most of the pubs are targeting under age drinkers because at the moment they have alot of spare income with no commitments where as adults are beginning to drink more sensibly and as a result spend less in the pubs.I have tried to stop my 14 year old son drinking in these pubs but social workers and police are unable to stop the pubs serving these youngsters.",
