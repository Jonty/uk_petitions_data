        "background": "It is very dangerous for old people to have to identify tablets whose physical form changes from week to week.  There should be a fixed design for each generic type of tablet and all manufacturers should be forced to follow the standard or not supply the NHS.\n\nAt present a particular drug may be orange and oval in blister packs containing 7 tablets one week and next week they are white, round and in packs of 28 and then in another format a week later.\n\nElderly people are so prone to confusion that this could be resulting in hundreds of deaths per year due to incorrect tablets being taken accidently.\n\nManufacturers have a high responsibility to patients, but they are letting us down and need to be curbed.",
