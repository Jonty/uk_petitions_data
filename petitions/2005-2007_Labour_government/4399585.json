            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The introduction of 8 hours per day hard labour to include such duties as breaking rocks, digging ditches, clearing blocked sewers and basically ensuring that all criminals know they will never have the soft option of our current prison system ever again.  It has been proven in the USA that criminals forced to live in crowded tents and undertaking such work very rarely re-offend and we the people of Great Britain demand that this system is brought into being as soon as possible.  Rehabilitation has consistently proven to be unsuccessful and the tax payer is sick and tired of paying out for thugs, rapists, paedophiles, drug dealers, etc., etc., to live in a system which provides comfort, free education, free food, free accommodation, free tv, free electronic games systems and free counselling.  Make them pay for their crimes as surely as their victims are paying having to live with the insecurity and fear brought on by crime.",
