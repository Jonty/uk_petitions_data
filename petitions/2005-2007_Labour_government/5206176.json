            "background": "David Beckham is a pleasant enough man, and a fairly good footballer, but has achieved no more than many other sports men and women.  The 1966 World Cup winning team were only awarded OBEs - to single David out for a knighthood would be an insult to the many other sports men and women of similar or better talent who have not recieved one, and little more than a publicity stunt that would demean the title.",
