        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Presently if buy your road tax in two 6 monthly parts you pay \u00a3192.50 whereas if you make a single 12 Month payment it only costs \u00a3175.00 this is a difference of \u00a317.50 or 10%.\n\nI consider this levy to be grossly unfair and a tax on the less well off.\n\nI do not believe that the additional administration associated with the issuing of two tax disc justifies this large charge especially as the process is largely automated and believe that this is just another example of a stealth tax.\n\nPlease highlight this issue and sign my petition\n\nThankyou\n\nDuncan Taylor\n\nwww.inet-designs.eu",
