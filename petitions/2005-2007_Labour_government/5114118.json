            "background": "The current standard punishment for ignoring a red traffic light is a fixed penalty notice with a \u00a360 fine and 3 points on the licence - not even a court appearance is necessary.\n\nContravening a red light is extremely dangerous and shows a total disregard for other road users, it is far too serious an offence to attract such a small fine and a small amount of points. There is no deterrent, and most people I know agree there is an increasing tendency amongst motorists in the UK to regard red lights as advisory only.\n\nThousands of speed cameras have been set up but hardly any traffic light cameras, and you can get the same \u00a360/3 point penaltly by exceeding the speed limit by a few mphs or talking on a mobile phone.\n\nI agree these two offences deserve a ticket, but I think contravening a red light is far more serious and far more likely to result in an accident. People should be able to cross a road with confidence knowing that when the lights are red the traffic will stop.",
