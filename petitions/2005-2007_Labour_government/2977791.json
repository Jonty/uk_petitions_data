            "background": "The plans to spend vast sums of taxpayers' money on an army of snoopers, who will be employed by local Councils' to spy on the people these Councils' are elected to represent, is an anathema to the British legal system and a waste of public money.  These official snoopers will have powers to enter homes to access the value for Council Taxes, they will spy on people in public places in case they dare to smoke and they already have powers to fine people for littering without having to produce evidence.  Added to this, ordinary citizens are being encouraged to spy on each other with the distribution of speed guns to ordinary, little trained, residents.  This is the British Isles, not Soviet Russia.  These plans to turn citizens against citizens should be stopped.",
