            "background": "With the proposed introduction of I.D. cards, increased length of detention without trial, and ever-encroaching use of CCTV and shared information of personal information between government departments, the Labour Government is increasingly eroding our civil rights and liberty in the name of the War on Terror and our \"security\". These acts will not make us more secure, nor will they help in the War on Terror. Signing away our civil liberties is not the answer, as it is this same liberty that makes our society strong and progressive. Detention without trial and I.D. cards are the hallmarks of fear. We should fight to keep our hard-won freedom and ideals, not throw them away in the face of fear. Removing our civil rights would only mean one thing: that Al Qaeda won when they destroyed the Twin Towers in 2001.",
