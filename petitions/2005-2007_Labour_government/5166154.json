After his loyal service the British Government has cast him on the scrap heap and is refusing him the right to live in Britain.\nAt a time when so many undeserving people are allowed to come and live here it is nothing short of a national disgrace that people who were willing to fight and die to protect our way of life should be thrown aside once their usefulness is outlived.  We should hang our heads in shame.",
