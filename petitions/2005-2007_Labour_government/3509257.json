Road charging will mean you can have as many cars as you like an efficient run around for work and a nice comfortable car for long journeys and even a 4x4 for the weekend yet you will only be charged for the one which you are using. \nSome other good reasons:\n\n1 Its better for me to use public transport for work and shopping as parking is a nightmare yet when im using the bus im still paying for my car?\n2 why should I pay the same as a light road user as a heavy road user\n3 there just isn\u2019t the room for many more cars\n4 When you have metered services at home ie water you will use less and be more efficient with what you do use",
