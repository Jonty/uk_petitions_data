            "background": "Recently, \u00a341 million in damages has been awarded against an Asian CD retailer for selling Asian versions of CDs to UK customers.\n\nPrices for CDs sold by this company were as low as \u00a34.99 for some of the most popular modern artists' albums, however in the UK the average CD price is \u00a38.50 (according to the BPI website).\n\nAnother example is that a large American supermarket sells music downloads for $0.88 (\u00a30.44 at 29/5/07). In the UK, the cheapest music downloads are around \u00a30.70 - an increase of almost 60% compared to the American price.\n\nWhy are we, the British people, being charged extra for exactly the same product? This is not due to taxes or the exchange rate, but rather the record companies attempting to make as much money as possible from Britain.",
