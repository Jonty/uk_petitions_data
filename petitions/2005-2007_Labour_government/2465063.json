            "background": "To enable people to have an alternative to using their private car the government needs to invest extra money in public transport. To raise this money we propose all the extra money that they raised at the next budget(s) should be ring fenced to be used on public transport, mostly to match funding provided by local councils. This way for every\u00a31of our council tax that is used on public transport\u00a32will be invested in public transport without anyone paying more than they would have had to have done anyway. \nThis could mean that: rural services are retained, newer buses, more bus shelters, more trains, branch lines reopened, or any other public transport improvement that can not currently be undertaken due to lack of funds.\nEven if you love driving you should sign up so that people that don\u2019t need to drive get off the roads leading to less congestion for you to get stuck in and you don\u2019t have to pay for the privilege!\nIf you agree please sign up and get others to do so too.",
