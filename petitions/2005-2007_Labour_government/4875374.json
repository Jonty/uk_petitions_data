            "background": "Some time ago I received information, from Amnesty International, on the treatment of victims.  It said - appallingly - that they are \"broken in\" by being repeatedly, and/or gang, raped. I was also told that, even though the Police know they have been victims of this appalling crime, they are treated as criminals rather than the victims they obviously are; the fact that they have entered the country illegally (hardly by their wish but because they were trafficked!) apparently considered as more important than what has happened to them (which is also a crime - far more serious and traumatic - but is not taken into account by the authorities).",
