            "background": "Why are customers of Mid Kent Water forced by law to pay the same rate for their water supply as they were prior to imposing restrictions that make the use of a hose pipe an offence. For almost two years we have been restricted without any reduction in our water bill. Why should Mid Kent Water still profit without providing the service for which they charge. The government also have a responsibility to reduce the housing burden on the south east region if the infrastructure cannot support it.",
