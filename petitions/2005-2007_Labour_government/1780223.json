        "background": "The carbon footprint/food miles of a product must be made visible to the consumer.  \n\nCo2 labelling must be become a legal requirement as soon as possible to encourage green consumption.  It will make an immediate and long-lasting reduction on carbon emissions.  Several large retailers are already doing it, but it should be extended to all. This could also include labelling of whether the product has travelled by air. It will also smooth the way to carbon rationing or personal carbon taxes.",
