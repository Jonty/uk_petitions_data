            "background": "A single person gets a 25% discount on council tax.  A married couple would pay 50% of their council tax bill each, so why should a single person pay 75% of a council tax bill.  We call on the government to reduce the single person discount to 50%.  That way, a single person would pay the same amount as a married person.  Being single is already expensive enough (paying all the rent/electricity/gas etc)",
