            "background": "There was massive public opposition in the UK that was ignored.\nThe war is illegal.\nThe dossier was sexed up.\nDr Kellys name was deliberately released with terrible consequences.\nThe prime minister lied to the house and the people to achieve his aims.\nMore than 130 members of the UK armed forces have lost their lives in Iraq.\nHundreds of thousands of Iraqi civilians have died.\nIraq is on the verge of civil war.\nYou were warned that home grown Islamic terrorism would result from going to war with Iraq.\nThe death of 56 Londoners and Jean-Charles de Menezes must weigh heavily on your conscience.  \nBillions of pounds of UK taxpayers money has been wasted.\nThe UK has never been involved in such an unjust war and you have brought shame on this country.\nThis is your legacy.",
