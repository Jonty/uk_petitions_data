            "background": "A house should be a home, not an investment, but property is seen as a very good investment, so investors with deep pockets are forcing out first time buyers. Theories of supply and demand tell you that the market should stagnate, since first time buyers at the bottom of the ladder cannot afford to buy...except their position is being taken by buy to let and so house prices continue to rise. To stop this we need to discourage buy to let and make other investments look more attractive. Additionally we need to discourage second homes, so Council Tax should be charged 100% on these. If we don't do something our land will be covered in housing and much of it rented.",
