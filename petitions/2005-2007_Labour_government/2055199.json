            "background": "Millions of pounds of NHS money are being wasted every year in unwanted medication.  Once medication has left the pharmacy it cannot be reused, even if it has been unopened, and must then be destroyed.  Bringing in a fixed low charge for every currently exempt prescription item will help the NHS in two ways, firstly by decreasing waste as people will be more inclined to take only what they need and secondly by bringing in more income for the NHS.  This petition is asking that everyone pay for their prescriptions,  and that those who are currently exempt pay only a low affordable token charge ie. \u00a31 or less per item.  This will include all items that are currently not charged for.",
