She is the cause why millions of children now read, and because of her we can rest assured that the next few generations of British people, will not abandon literature and books. There is no doubt that she has done a great good for the British Empire, and deserves the title of Dame (DBE). How can remind her Majesty of this, and ask that Rowling be made DBE?",
