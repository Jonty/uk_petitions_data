As many of them opt for private alternatives, they are not affected to the same degree as those who cannot afford the same luxury. \nIf ministers were banned from using private schools or health care it would provide the perfect incentive for them to apply the necessary attention, effort, urgency and funding to these important areas so that they are run to a standard that members of the government would be prepared to accept for themselves and their families.",
