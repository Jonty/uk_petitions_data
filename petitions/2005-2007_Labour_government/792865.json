            "background": "The inheritance tax system was initially put in place to redistribute the wealth from the higher and upper classes. The current system of a fixed sum is no longer valid as this value was set some time ago and what was considered a lot of money is no longer the valid.\n\nThe inheritance tax system should be linked to inflation so as the wealth of the general population grows the threshold increases and still only taxes the people where the wealth can and should be redistributed.\n\nPlease sign this petition if you believe that the inheritance tax system should be moved to a more flexible system linked to inflation.",
