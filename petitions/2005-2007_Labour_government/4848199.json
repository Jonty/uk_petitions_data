        "background": "Richard Brunstrom, Chief Constable of North Wales, released the horrific images without consulting the dead man's family. \nOne picture showed the man's head, with the eyes still open, on a grass verge. It was still encased in a red and white helmet, with the visor raised. \nAnother picture showed the man's torso - in a T-shirt emblazoned with an anti-traffic police slogan - embedded in a car. \nCampaigners condemned Mr Brunstrom's actions as \"deplorable\" and called for his resignation. \nLast year, Mr Brunstrom personally endorsed a vending machine for drugs addicts in Colwyn Bay. \nHis force took out a newspaper advertisement apologising to a man who was dragged from his bed at gunpoint for a crime he did not commit. \nHe once used the word \"queer\" to refer to activities by homosexuals in public lavatories - escaping punishment by apologising for the \"inappropriate\" word. \nIn 2001 the force spent \u00a34,000 investigating \"anti-Welsh\" comments by The Weakest Link host Anne Robinson. \nMr Brunstrom also defied Crown Prosecution Service advice by investigating claims that Tony Blair shouted \"f****** Welsh\" after Labour's poor performance in the 1999 Welsh Assembly election.",
