In 1990 Doug MacLean observed the destruction of Lyme Disease spirochetes at 625hz and cured his ailments. The effect of tuned radio waves has been proven to work on a whole host of ailments. Why is there no apparent research, other than military, on this important topic anywhere!\n(it is expected that this petition will rank as the lowest with just one signature!)",
