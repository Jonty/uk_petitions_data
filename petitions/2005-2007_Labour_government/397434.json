            "background": "buying Biodiesel at the moment can be very expensive, while some have no problem with it others have had their engines severly damaged, and quite often the reason is poor quailty fuel. The government should make sure that the entire production chain is regulated and auditable so that we can ensure the quality and the origin of the Biodiesel we use, and also ensure that regulation doesn't cost the honest pioneers in this area thousands of pounds they can ill afford.",
