            "background": "The government has asked for a debate about the ways in which vehicle use can be reduced. It is apparent that car users in particular have formed a vocal lobby to object to some of the proposals put forward so far by the government. However roads are not just for the sole use of car users and other citizens need to be part of this debate. Pedestrians, cyclists, wheelchair users, horse riders and many others who use or navigate across roads do not currently appear to have a voice. This petition hopes to give them one.",
