        "background": "All the goverment targets and fines are taking away vital and much needed funds and stopping hospitals from being able to treat patients and employ staff. If hospitals were no longer ran as business' funds that were drawn away for fines and can be used to pay staff and fund services. Staff could also get on with their real job, rather then worry about targets all the time. It may also mean that less management will be needed, thus creating more funds for staff and equipment.",
