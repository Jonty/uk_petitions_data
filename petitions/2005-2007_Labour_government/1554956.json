            "background": "The Sick and Disabled are as vulnerable as the elderly and are in as much if not more need of being kept warm over the winter months.  Many disabled people are unable to move about to keep themselves warm so heating is essential.  The majority of sick & disabled people are housebound & as a result of this their heating costs are huge, we need government help to meet these large winter bills.  Without help to meet these bills many disabled and sick could end up being hospitalised as they strive to save energy to reduce incoming bills.",
