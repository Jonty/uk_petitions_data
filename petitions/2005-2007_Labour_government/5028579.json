            "background": "The current Polish government, led by twin brothers, Lech and Jaroslaw Kaczynski, is moving increasingly towards an authoritarian, facist state.  The media is vetted and controlled by the government.  Women are treated like second class citizens, there have been recent moves towards making abortion totally illegal even if there is a risk to the mother's health or life, or if it is the result of a rape.  Minority groups such as homosexuals are openly attacked by government officials.  For these reasons, and many more, the British government should have no political contact with a government that is to all intents and purposes attempting to move towards facism.",
