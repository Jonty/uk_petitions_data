            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Many new build houses are bought by private landlords and companies with the sole intention of letting them. This prevents first time buyers from entering the property market, raises house prices, and thence would-be first time buyers to have to rent, increasing the profits of the greedy few. I propose that legislation is introduced that prevents all new-build residential properties from being let for a period of up to five years. This will have the effect of reducing the cost of new-build houses, in particular two-bedroom properties, thereby rendering them affordable to first time buyers. It will have a beneficial effect on the housing boom, enabling it to stay under control. Rural buyers, in particular will benefit, and it will stop the outflow from local communities of younger people, currently forced out by the price of property.",
