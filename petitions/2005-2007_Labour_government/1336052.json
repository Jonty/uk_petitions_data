            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are too many new rules  that  are just throttling small business. We are simply over-governed and patronised. We have to meet the same rules as much larger organisations but without the same expertise and resources. For example, we don't have a Human Resource department to guide us  on all the new legal requirements  both before  and after a  staff interview. We don't have have the same  ability to deal with all the new Health and Safety,Disability Access,  Money Laundering, Employment  or Waste Disposal legislataion. In fact,  both at home and at work,you can't change a window or an electrical socket without the necessary legal consent. Commendable as these new rules are, why not just leave small business  to use its common sense in most of these areas? If small business desires  to succeed and attract good quality staff & customers, it will be in its interests to follow these  rules.Why must we make  it illegal for them not to do so?",
