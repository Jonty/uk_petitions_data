Surely they should not be penalised!  Such an imposition would infringe not only the liberty of the driver but the person visited, when the \"eye in the sky\" spied on innocent folk. When offering comfort to bereaved people we would risk their privacy/confidentiality.  If we were to claim expenses from our Charities they would soon go bankrupt as it is hard enough to raise funds anyway.\nPLEASE, think it through.",
