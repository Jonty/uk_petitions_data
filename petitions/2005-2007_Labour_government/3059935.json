Whether it be extra 'pay as you go' road tax, tax on top of tax on fuel, increases in council tax, etc etc. I, and my family are sick to death of struggling to get by, only to see civil 'servants' wasting our hard earned money. Lets see Tony Blair stripped of everything he owns, and then try to make do on the money we earn. I think he would have a sudden change of heart, when the next stealth tax is suggested. We are at breaking point !!",
