            "background": "Beltane (May 1st) is an ancient British festival, celebrating fertility and the coming of summer. \nContrary to popular belief this is NOT a Christian country. There were other cultures in these islands long before Christ is supposed to have lived.\nCelebrating Beltane will ensure that the Old Religion lives on and that young people are taught the pre-Christian history and to respect ALL beliefs. Please be aware. Pagans DO NOT worship the 'Devil'. Such a being has no place in our beliefs.",
