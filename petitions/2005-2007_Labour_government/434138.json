        "action": "Review the special needs provision across the country and provide clear rules and targets local education authorities must comply with in order to remove the local authority lottery of special education provision across the country.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Parents of children with special education needs have to fight in order to get their child the education they deserve. As a parent of a dyslexic child I found that the local authority where i used to live did not recognise dyslexia and therefore were reluctant to provide any help.  However, I am sure that had my child have behavioural problems more would have been done to help.  After years of constant frustration with the LEA we moved to a more enlightened authority where my daughter was properly assessed and was given the appropriate help which has made a tremendous difference to her self-esteem.\nThe government should therefore do something about the problem rather than simply using their publicly funded salaries to go private while the public, the majority of whom cannot afford to follow suit, are left at the mercy of overly bureaucratic local authorities which may or may not depending on where you live give your child the education they deserve and the help they need.",
