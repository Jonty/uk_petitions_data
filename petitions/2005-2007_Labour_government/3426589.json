            "background": "Introduce a short term disabled parking permit scheme based purely on a written doctors letter for heart condition sufferers who are awaiting open heart surgery or stent treatment who would otherwise have to make an untrue / exagerated statement to obtain a Blue Badge permit.\nWe don't need this help for ever just while we await treatment..maybe up to 6 months. A blind person who obviously cannot drive and apart from blindness is physically capable of walking reasonable distances can get a blue badge but a person like myself who last year was turned down for a blue badge \"because I did not meet all the criteria\" although I had to purchase a mobility scooter just so that I could walk my dog or even get out side for any length of time. I say lets be fair to heart condition sufferers and not discriminate against a section of the public.",
