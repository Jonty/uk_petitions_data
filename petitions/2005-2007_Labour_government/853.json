            "background": "We are a country that is heavily dependant on good quality communications e.g. Telecommunication Network for commerce, education, international relations and our economic future. I would like to see a National Minimum Standard for High Speed Broadband Accessibility, Speed and Connectivity, which guarantees the same service levels for everyone regardless of area and supplier. I have been told by numerous Telecommunication Engineers that these rules simply don\u2019t exist at the moment. Any company or person found to be interfering e.g. \u201cRFI\u201d with the local Broadband service could be prosecuted in the same way as if they were interfering with normal Telephone Network Line.",
