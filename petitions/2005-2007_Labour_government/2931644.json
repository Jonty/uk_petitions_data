            "background": "Most of todays urban and suburban traffic congestion, has been falsely created, by reducing the use of carriageways to accomodate bus lanes,unnecessary rarely used cycle lanes, stupid road markings,(hatching,etc),badly timed traffic lights at peak times,unnecesary mini roundabouts,and in most cases, just reducing dual carriageway roads, to 1 lane. lowering speed limits, on major roads,and every trick in the book, to bring about traffic mayhem, with the final result that we will hopefully get sick and tired of sitting in stationary cars, and migrate to public transport!This is a ploy by the government to increase revenue by so called congestion charging.Our journeys would not be congested except for the obstacles put in place by the government in the first place! Why has no-one figured this out?\nTherefore put our roads in order, by making them practical to use,and remove all these purposely placed traffic slowing measures!",
