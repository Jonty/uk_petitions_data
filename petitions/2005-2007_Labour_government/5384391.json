        "background": "Most of the mainstream sports are now only available to view for those of us who have satellite dishes.  Prisoners are able to watch Premiership football, test cricket, world title boxing bouts ECT.  These are denied to people who cannot afford the boxes, or have them but cannot afford the extra payments required.  Those in hospital or in care homes are also excluded.  All sport should be available too the public through TV at no extra costs.\nWe therefore ask that prime minister conduct a meeting between all the governing sports bodies and terrestrial TV companies, to encourage cooperation in achieving the results we ask for.",
