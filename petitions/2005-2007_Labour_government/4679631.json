The emissions avoidable must be made a priority, as must the cost to the nation in terms of under-use of a valuable resource, the nearside lane. One third of our arterial road structure is wasted due to ineducation in basic motorway etiquette. A short, sharp campaign would save very many lives lost by impatience and billions on road-building and fuel wastage.",
