            "background": "The Trident Weapons System was a necessary deterrent in the time of the Cold War, however nuclear weapons deserve no place in a peaceful, stable future of the planet.  As one of the leading nations of the world, it's high time that for once our government encouraged the notion of peace, before we doom our children and their children to a future where nuclear weapons are spiraling out of control.\n\nNuclear disarmament has to start somewhere, with the current state of the NHS and low-lifes running many of Britain's inner-city streets, the obscene amount of funds that will be spent in this warmongering program could be better spent saving the lives of our own citizens rather than continuing our \"Do as I say not as I do\" attitude with owning nuclear weapons.",
