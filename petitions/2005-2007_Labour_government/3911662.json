(Stopping Governments from raising stealth taxes instead of Income Tax, merely to save face.)\nThis would also prevent a Government from transferring funds from one area, with high house prices, to another area more sympathetic to that Government. (Effectively, this would reduce the practise of political bribes for votes.) \nThus, a Band D house in Area A, valued at \u00a3400,000, does not necessarily pay a penny more than a similar house in Area B, valued at \u00a3200,000.",
