            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\n\nPlease reduce urban speed limits and improve the quality of life for millions of people living in the UK. Hundreds of pedestrian\u2019s lives are taken on the roads every year in our towns and cities (as well as suffering thousands of life changing injuries), many of these would still be alive today if speed limits were reduced and steps were taken to eliminate the culture of speeding that exists on our roads.\nThese steps would have no negative consequences with journey times staying the same or even decreasing due to more efficient use of junctions.\nIt has also been shown that there would be significant savings to the economy due to reduction of accidents with its associated disruption to normal traffic flow, use of police and medical staff and equipment as well as staff sickness.\nPrime minister, reduce the speed limits in built up areas and make the UK a better and safer place to live for all of us.\n\nBest regards,\nMr Dominic Tyler",
