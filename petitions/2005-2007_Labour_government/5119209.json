            "background": "A gay rights demonstration in Moscow on the 27th May 2007 degenerated into violence for the second year running as right-wing and orthodox extremists attacked gay rights activists and supporters of the unauthorised demonstration.\nDuring the demonstration, Police intervened to arrest dozens of gay rights activists - however only rarely detained their attackers. This is surely against the Human rights of the demonstrators - Russia is a country within the European, and under The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the EU, protestors are legally permitted to hold such rallies if they so wish.\n\nMayor Luzhkov's office says it banned this year's gay pride march - i believe (as do Over 50 MEPS - Members of the European Parliament) that people should be able to express themselves and be able to march - please sign the petitions to ask the Prime Minster to take action if you also believe in this statement.",
