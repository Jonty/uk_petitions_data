        "action": "legalize the consumption and sale of cannabis, regulated and taxed in a similar way to alcohol and cigarettes, to raise revenue to avoid having to pay extra 'road' tax",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The government gets an immense amount of money from taxes from alcohol and cigarettes every year.  Currently Cannabis is sold in a smaller but still significant quantity on the underground market.  This profit is going untaxed into drug dealers pockets, who also claim benefits.\n\nDoing this would solve the road tax problem (not the environmental issues surrounding it but no one is going to drive less, they are just going to have to pay more) and also allow extra money for the NHS (no it wouldn't cost the NHS more because everyone is still smoking and smokers almost pay for part of the NHS every year in their taxes!).\n\nThis would also cut the dealers out of the equation and hopefully help to control the stronger strands of cannabis through regulation and control of the substance.",
