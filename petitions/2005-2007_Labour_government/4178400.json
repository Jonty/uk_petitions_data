I believe it is ridiculous how animals that bolt at cars, are allowed on roads where cars travel at 60mph. I know how riders need somewhere to ride, but the road side, is not the place to do it any more. I always slow down for horses, but I'm sure that many of us have had a time where it's been perhaps dangerous, or to late too brake by the time you see them.",
