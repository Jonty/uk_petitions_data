            "background": "I, like the majority of Design and Creative Art degree graduates am finding it hard to get that all important first job in the design industry, and I'm sure like most others I thought completing my degree would help me to find a job rather then hinder my search. The main problem I am faced with is lack of industry experience! This seems to be the area potential employers look at first and if you haven't got experience the rest means nothing, making the degree practically worthless! I don't think design graduates are getting the respect there degrees warrent. Lack of industry experience doesn't mean lack of ability or knowledge of the industry, and I would like to see more help given to Design and Creative Arts graduates to gain employment, either by creating more placements in the design industry or providing employers with more benifits for creating jobs for graduates.",
