            "background": "SERVICES FOR DISABLED PEOPLE\n\nPart 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) became law in October 2004.   and requires that service providers must take reasonable steps to overcome barriers to access.  Significantly, Part 3 does not require providers to give details of any improvements they make to accessibility. \n\nIn consequence, a disabled person wishing to purchase specific goods  must study local advertisements or classified directories and prepare a list of appropriate providers.  They must then make precautionary enquiries hoping to find one on the list whose services are accessible to someone suffering from their particular impairment. Such enquiries will be time consuming, potentially embarrassing and may well prove fruitless.\n\nPROPOSED SOLUTION\nAll providers should be required to publish information describing the accessibility of their services in such a manner that a person suffering from one of the impairments included in the Act may determine, without visiting the premises concerned, whether that service is likely to be accessible. \n\nThe aim of the above proposal might be described as \u2018For all to See\u2019 or, for brevity, 4all2C.",
