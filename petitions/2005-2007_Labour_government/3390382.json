These people who were supposed to be exempt from the tax were not exempted through maladministration, and still being persued for the money to this day.It must be costing council's substancial amounts of tax payers money persuing this unpaid tax, which as far as I can see will continue unpaid. Perhaps \"Mr Anon's\" apology should have  been advanced from words to action.  Please note that I am not naming people to prevent libell. My opinions are however true, and I was persued for the tax whilst living in England during  first year of the tax was  applied in Scotland. I was persued for the tax after living in Canada on the second year of the tax collection.",
