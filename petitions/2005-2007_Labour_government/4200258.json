The Union has already been broken - we want fairness and equality and the only way to achieve that is for England to separate from Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.\n\nThe current Government, because of its high proportion of Scotish MPs, is inherently racially biased against England and its people.\n\nWe, the people of England, demand devolution.",
