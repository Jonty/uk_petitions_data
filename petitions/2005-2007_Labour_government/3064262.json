            "background": "The Government should consider more radical means of reducing the number of cars on the road, for example, increase in 24 hour travel on railways making better use of spare capacity,  tax breaks for home working, limiting imigration, reduce the programme for house building, taxing mulitple car ownership.  This would have a greater impact on the volume of cars on our roads.  Road pricing is just another tax on the hard working ingigenous population.",
