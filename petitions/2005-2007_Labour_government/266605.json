        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As a Student Nurse, I know how much myself and other students struggle financially while training. This applies largely to those undertaking the Degree Route. As a Degree Student, our Bursary is Means Tested on our parents, or if a mature student, our partners income. However, Diploma students Bursary is NOT Means Tested and they are given a direct payment of \u00a3450 +. This inequality is unfair. We should all get the same for doing the same training and inevitable job. I myself am awarded \u00a3195 a month for my training, while a friend of mine is given \u00a3140 a month. How is this fair - we should get the same amount regardless of Degree or Diploma status.",
