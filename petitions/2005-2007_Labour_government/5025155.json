        "background": "Im like other people who work 5 days a week, sometimes more than 40+ hours who dont get a chance to have a council property. Im sick of young girls getting themselves pregnant and getting a council property so easily. If they think they are responsible enough to have a child then they should be able to provide for that child instead of hoping the council will, its disgusting and unfair. i have been on the council list for 2 years now, what help do the hardworkers get? nothing!!",
