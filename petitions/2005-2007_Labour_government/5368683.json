Payments should not decrease just because a 2nd , 3rd child is born . The percentage should stay the same for all. NRP get away with not paying for there children & it isnt right, there are too many loopholes allowing NRP's to avoid paying & avoid paying arrears !! They should not be allowed access if they dont pay either . Its about time they took responsibility for there children !!!",
