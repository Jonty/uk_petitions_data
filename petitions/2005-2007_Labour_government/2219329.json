Instead of considering road tax, why does the government not investigate and implement MTR with cheap, combined parking and fare fees from suitable locations outside the urban area to Leeds and other city centres. Low costs say \u00a32 a day would attract drivers, if a MTR was efficient and reliable, and parking sufficient and located in strategic positions on the motorway network. For example Leeds could be served by three or four MTRs routes from the M62 at Ferrybridge, the M1 at Wakefield, the M62 at Huddersfield and for traffic from the north at or near the Leeds Grammar school.",
