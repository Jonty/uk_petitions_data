            "background": "in order to tackle obesity and increasing fares the free travel for kids needs to be scrapped. \n\na majority of school kids go just two stops down the road to get to school, the primeminster should consider the following points:\n\n1: limiting the free travel to students who only live out of reach of their school and require transport.\n\n2: School kids dont go to school on a weekend, so let them pay their way.\n\n3:the re-introduction of 40p fares for school children would raise enough money to take some off for the daily commuter who goes to work.",
