            "background": "My local primary school has a problem with attendance, and has taken to sending letters of a rather threatening nature to parents informing them that they may be prosecuted if they keep allowing their children to take time off school. This has inevitably led to parents sending sick children to school. Our school also has numerous water fountains placed in classrooms and around the school. Needless to say, this is causing the illnesses carried by these sick children to be rapidly spread among the children, which serves to exacerbate the problems with attendance. I feel that having water fountains in schools is an archaic practice which is extremely unhygienic and in this modern age when we are so conscious of the spread of illness, they should be outmoded and replaced with water barrels and cups. Please help support this petition.",
