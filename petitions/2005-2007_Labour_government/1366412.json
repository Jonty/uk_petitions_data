            "background": "We would like to see the supply of plastic bags banned to enforce people to use sustainable and environmentally friendly options such as fabric bags which have a practically unlimited life span. Stores could have a supply of recycled paper bags at a small cost for customers who need/wish to use these. We believe the government must take responsibility for this as it is a significant environmental issue.",
