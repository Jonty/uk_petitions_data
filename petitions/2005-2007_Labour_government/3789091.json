            "background": "Most of us work best when we are fresh and our productivity declines after a long week, \n\nThe Government should set an example by removing the overtime premia, except for unsocial hours, and adding a premia for the first twenty hours per week for all public sector staff. \n\nThis would also support worklife balance policies helping parents, disabled people and carers amongst others, it may also serve to reduce poverty by helping more people to get back to work and overcome the benefits trap.",
