From that you take VAT, car tax, patrol tax, community charge,alcohol and cigarette duty - even tax on insurance premiums. It is just one step too far to take another 40% when someone dies. It is immoral because of the timing and the circumstances and is is excessive because it is levied on what is left after all the other tax. Please abolish it.",
