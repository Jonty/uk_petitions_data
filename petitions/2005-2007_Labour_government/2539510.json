            "background": "This country has millions of hard working people who see alot of their money taken away by numerous taxes. Take for example the Council tax, year on year increases yet no real improvements. Most working people are now not seeing any increases in their salaries with most salary rises suspended, yet we are still expected to pay out higher taxes. I would like to see all taxes reduced by 40% with no further increases and also an end to any further taxes being made, WE THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH AND DEMAND FAIRNESS FOR ALL.",
