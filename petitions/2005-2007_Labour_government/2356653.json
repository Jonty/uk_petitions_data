Tony Worthington (Clydebank and Milngavie-Lab), on 4th February 2004, and the AU Fact Finding Report that confirmed Somaliland independence quest as a special case, we implore you take a leading role in supporting and protecting Somaliland's nascent democracy from collapse either due to continued international indifference, active military attack by Somalia or external terrorism. It is morally imperative and politically expedient to support Somaliland\u2019s democracy as a definite way of averting a perpetual conflict in the Horn of Africa",
