            "background": "People who drive illegally, without a licence or while banned, are responsible for a disproportionately large number of accidents and deaths on the road. Yet there is nothing to stop them buying another car and driving again, illegally.\n\nAnyone selling a car should be forced to check the criminal records of any prospective buyer, via Criminal Record Bureau or DVLA checks. If the buyer is banned from driving or has no licence, it should be a criminal offence to sell him or her the car.\n\nAn Enhanced check, taking into account points on the licence or forthcoming court cases, should be used to ban people from buying high powered sports cars and 4-wheel drive vehicles, if they may use them dangerously.",
