Applicants are told to appeal to the Tax Credit office and even go so far as involving the Adjudicators Office which is a very lengthy frustrating process.  This is to no avail and the Tax Credit will not admit to overlooking an error made by an applicant or making the error themselves so honest working famillies are being made to re-pay the errors.  \nPlease help honest working parents by abolishing the Tax Credit Syestem and cancelling the debt.",
