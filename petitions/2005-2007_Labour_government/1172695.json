            "background": "One of the biggest congestion causes on the A12. A lot of traffic comes out of Witham to join the A12. This causes a long tailback to the Witham north junction as traffic merges (3 miles). The Hatfield Peverel slip road is 1/2 a mile furthur south. If the two slip roads were joined with an extra lane the congestion would be greatly reduced. There is plenty of land available beside the carrigeway for this.",
