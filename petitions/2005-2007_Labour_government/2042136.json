            "background": "Staff who work in residential care homes with the elderly and adults and children with learning disability should be of the highest calibre we can find.  They should be trained to a high standard, benefit from an encouraging and enabling career structure and be paid a great deal more than the minimum wage.  Use of agency and transient staff might therefore become a thing of the past and the quality of care improve dramatically.",
