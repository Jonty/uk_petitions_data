            "background": "Many cases brought before the family courts involve domestic violence and other crimes against women and children. Some perpetrators use child contact cases to continue abuse of these people without fear of conviction or exposure in public. They can do this because victims are made to remain silent about their cases for fear of losing custody of their children. This should not be allowed to continue. If secrecy of family courts were ended, the continuing abuse of victims would be reduced.",
