            "background": "Most respected Prime Minister,\nImmigration charges that the Home Office charge on immigrants, be it for a work permit/HSMP/Permanent Residency/Citizen are too high that many qualifying residents are not able to afford. The Home office has become a money-spinning machine, by squeezing, up to the last penny from voiceless immigrants. Most of the immigrants are stretched beyond their financial limits to pay the Home Office and are pushed to celebrate their new status as a citizen/PR with debts mounting to thousands of pounds. This is a real shame and I am sure the costs are not justifiable. It is a great country that genuine people long to get citizenship of. I strongly believe that genuine concerns of people are always respected and actioned upon in this country. I request you to make arrangements to review the cost of immigration charges.\n\nThank you.",
