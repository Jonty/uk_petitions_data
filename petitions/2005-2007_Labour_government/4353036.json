            "background": "What talks? Money! If public transport were nationalised it could be cheap and reliable, like the french system. People love their purses and the money in them and if buses and trains were cheap, people would leave their cars behind. I know I would! Why should our tax go to subsidise private rail and bus companies? We have to look at the long term beneifts of renationalising out transport networks. Yes, it will cost money but so does the continual subsidising of private companies. Britian wasn't designed to have so many cars on its roads.Can't we look at systems that work in other countries and copy this?",
