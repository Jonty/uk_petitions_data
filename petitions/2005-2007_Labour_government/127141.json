It was the worst decision by any British postwar government, combining the lowest level of competence and foresight, the lowest level of truth and the lowest level of responsibility - for Tony Blair has never once acknowledged the consequences of his decisions. A public apology would allow him to depart with some measure of honour. If performed where suggested, it would fill the Millennium Dome for the only time in its life.",
