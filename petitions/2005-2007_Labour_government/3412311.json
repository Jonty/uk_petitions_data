            "background": "Nobody seems to want to know about those that suffer from schizophrenia, a mental illness of the brain. It is a devastating illness which robs people of their lives. Some people that suffer from it can no longer function in society. Some don't even know that they are ill. They are given antipsychotic drugs, which in turn can increase their weight considerably and then the patient is not motivated to try and lose weight. It is a visious cycle. Some suffers have to go through the horrifying ordeal of being sectioned and forced into hospital, sometimes not even aware of the reason they are there. Families are left and try and get on with their lives which isn't one of very good quality, it's frustrating to know that there is nothing we can physically do to make things better. The mind is very complex and more research into this area would allow more insight into this condition, and hopefully one day a breakthrough allowing some hope to those victimes of the illness and their families.",
