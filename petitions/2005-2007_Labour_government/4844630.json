        "background": "The current legislation to ban anything resembling a replica gun will have serious implications for many law-abiding citizens who collect replica or real movie props as a hobby.\n\nThis hobby has existed peacefully for many years now, and is an increasingly popular section of movie memorabilia collecting.\n\nSince the government has seen fit to grant an exemption to airsoft players, I propose a similar system for prop collectors and costumers?\n\nWould it not be possible to create a licencing system for peaceful people who just want to continue a much loved hobby?",
