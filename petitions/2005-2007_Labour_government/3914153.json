            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A ten year period of dual use of miles/mph and kilometres/kph would provide the general public with an opportunity to use whichever they preferred. It would give people time to become more familiar with kilometres, as a prelude to full metrication. It would also make it easier for tourists and other visitors to understand UK road distances and traffic speeds, because they are likely to only be familiar with kilometres/kph.\n\nDuring the first half of the ten year period, miles/mph would be the primary measure and kilometres/kph would be secondary. During the second half of the ten year period, the situation would be reversed.\n\nIn that sense, it would be similar to the transition from Fahrenheit to Celsius that has taken place over the past decade.",
