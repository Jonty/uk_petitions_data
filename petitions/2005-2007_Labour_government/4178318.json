NOT by everyone paying for the services each individual requires; I realise the superficial appeal of that but where would it leave people who CAN'T AFFORD to pay for such services?  Income tax is a way - not perfect by any means but still - of equalising living standards since (to at least the modest extent possible with a top rate of 40% and no longer a lower rate of 10%) those who can afford the most pay the most.",
