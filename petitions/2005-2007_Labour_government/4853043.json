            "background": "As it stands with 'Analogue T.V. Broadcasting' the rules are that any receiver, TV, Video Recorder, DVD recorder, needs a license because it picks up BBC transmissions, whether a person watches these transmissions or not.\nWith the advent of 'Total Digital Broadcasting' the BBC can now 'scramble' their transmissions as SKY TV does, so why can this not be done giving anyone who needs to watch BBC the choice of paying the license fee and instead of a piece of paper being issued a viewing card instead.",
