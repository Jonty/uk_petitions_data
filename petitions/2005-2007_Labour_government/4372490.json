            "background": "Please allow all sides of the car debate a say and please do not reject petitions that are pro car in order to supress legitimate mainstream majority view points. The government has shown a lack of regard for the millions of people who need and rely on their cars as a lifeline.The anti car policies that are being advocated by a minority of the population  who support vociferous but minority environmental pressure groups should be resisted and more pro car policies introduced.At least 1.8 million voters do not want to be priced off the roads and many are at the limit of what they can afford to stay mobile.Outside the south east of England there are no alternatves to the car and the problems of congestion in the South should not mean that the whole nation should suffer.Forcing people out of cars is not the answer, more roads, better planning, ending bus priority lanes and traffic schemes designed to slow the flow of traffic would be a better answer,\n\n Drivers please support this petition before you are forced off the roads!!",
