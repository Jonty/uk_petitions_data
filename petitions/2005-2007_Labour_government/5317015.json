            "background": "There are a number of local facilites such as swimming pools, local goverment office's, leisure facilities and museums funded by taxpayers. \nUnfortuantly many of these facilities are only available monday-friday. It is unfair and frustrating that its the benefit claimers whom dont work that have unlimited access during these periods whilst the rest of us work to pay for them. I propose these facilites are availabe on weekends for those that work and pay for them in the first place.\nPublic services need to adapt to our changing lifestyle and working habits.",
