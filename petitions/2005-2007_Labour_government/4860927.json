            "background": "We here at the Talented Young People organisation believe the country has got to a point where the only thing important to schools are for them to get as many students achieving 5 grades A* - C. The government should be investing more time and money in young people and encouraging their diversity of skills and talents so that this nation wouldn't have a shortage of skilled workers in certain industries and that young people leaving school would have a clear picture of the opportunities that are available to them. The government should be informing, educating and motivating the youth of this nation as it's only by doing this that we can hope for a better future for this planet. We need education which gives young people a bright future and not one that just looks good for national statistics. Vocational and personal skills are just as important as education in today's workplace so let's start treating them as equally important in schools.",
