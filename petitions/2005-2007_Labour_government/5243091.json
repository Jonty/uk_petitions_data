        "background": "Hartley Alleyne, once an international cricketer for the Barbados team and county player for Kent, made his home in the UK twenty nine years ago, has a british wife and children born in this country. He has taught sport at St. Edmund's school Canterbury for over half a decade. Yet this fine upstanding man who has over this time always remained in his mind a british citizen is having his work permit revoked and being forced out of this country by the Home office. The reason they state is that he is \"not qualified\" to teach sport. We the undersigned believe this is beyond belief as who could be more qualified to teach sport than a sporting legend. Please take time to consider this petition and see sense.",
