            "background": "The marked increase in employment agencies (EA) since de-regulation has had a detrimental effect on the job seeker; 1) Many jobs are advertised on the same Boards many times by different EA's therefore an applicant may apply for the same job several times but to various EA's, 2) When employed via such an EA too much of the employees wage is taken by the EA for insubstantial work in comparison, 3) Many EA's require an introductary interview which incurs cost on the jobseeker (particulary if they have to travel all round the country to do this) therefore, M & A activity is required to make EA's more local to the job seeker.",
