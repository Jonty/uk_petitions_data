            "background": "We, the undersigned, believe the 'war on terror' is a poorly defined tactical construct and that the UK is not really at war. If we are at war, the public should know the full details and so demand the following questions be properly addressed through an independent inquiry:\n\n- What is the UK definition of the 'war on terror'?\n\n- Is 'terror' a legitimate military objective?\n\n- What are the causes of terrorism?\n\n- Can terrorism be successfully combated with traditional military means?\n\n- What progress are we making in the 'war on terror'?\n\n- Why is there no internationally agreed definition of 'terrorism'?\n\nWe, the undersigned, believe that such basic questions have never been answered satisfactorily, or at all. This should be a pre-requisite, rather than an afterthought, to war.",
