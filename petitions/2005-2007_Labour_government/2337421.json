            "background": "If you look on British roads in this modern day and age every other lorry that you see is foreign, I believe that our country should start to charge foreign lorry drivers road tax. If countries like Switzerland can charge companies road tax for a minimum of a month why can\u2019t a country of our economical fianc\u00e9 and power be able to the same?   \n     I believe that this should happen because the Lorries that come from abroad do not pay to use our roads, they do not pay for fuel from this country, if the government wants to charge the British motorists for every mile that they drive why should we not do the same to people that travel from abroad.  The foreign lorry drivers do not contribute to our countries motorway maintenance which ever Uk driver has to contribute to with his TAX",
