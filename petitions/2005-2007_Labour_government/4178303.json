            "background": "Charging \u00a3400 tax on 4x4 vehicles will simply mean the most expensive and consequently larger engined petrol 4x4's owned by higher earners will stay on the road as this is not a discouraging amount. Those on low incomes (and consequently smaller engine size due to the cost of fuel) that NEED a 4x4  day to day will be taxed away from them. This is a tax that unfairly favours the well off and penalises those on low incomes. Means testing and taxing as a % of earnings or value of vehicle would be far more effective.",
