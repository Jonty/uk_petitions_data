            "background": "Large amounts of money are paid to the rail companies each year, this could be saved if the railways were scraped, and the geographical assets could be used more effectively. The tracks should be tarmaced over to make dedicated roads for HGV\u2019s and busses. This would free up the motorways and suburban roads, the HGV\u2019s and busses would emerge from the train station directly in the center of town. Busses would offer a much more frequent and therefor more user friendly service than trains. At rush hour they could tow 1 or 2 trailers, only on these new roads, which could be left overnight at intermediate stations and would ensure seats for people living closer to town. The shunting yards would be park and ride sites.",
