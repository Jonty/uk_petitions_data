This is a good idea but it increases our travel journey times to and from our destinations. Because of this we need to increase the speed limit (i.e 60 mph) on our open roads.\nIt is not speed that kills it is bad driving and drivers that kill.\nIt would also stop the \"Bunching up of traffic\" on our roads.",
