            "background": "A major threat to future generations is the damage we are currently doing to the environment.  The amount of packaging used by supermarkets is often far higher than it needs to be, I remember when we recycled glass bottles and took vegtables home in paper bags.  They could easily reduce this use of packaging but they never go far enough.  The governement should act by using the tax system to penalise over packaging and encouraging recycling.",
