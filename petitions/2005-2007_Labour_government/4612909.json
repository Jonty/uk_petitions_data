            "action": "initiate a feasibility study involving expert input from government departments and from the pharmaceutical industry.  The question to answer is as follows.  Is it feasible to introduce a symbol, expressed as a logo, which may be used on the packaging of a pack of pharmaceuticals such that the logo conserves all logos and other information related to the quality of the pharmaceuticals in the pack yet cancels the licence to sell the pharmaceuticals in that particular pack in the developed world?  The intention of the study is that if this idea is feasible and becomes implemented then hopefully some pharmaceutical companies would make and distribute packs of pharmaceuticals carrying one or more copies of the logo for use by hospitals and doctors in the poorest countries of the developing world.  They would charge the incremental cost of producing those packs of pharmaceuticals without on those particular packs seeking to recover the development costs of the pharmaceuticals in the pack.",
