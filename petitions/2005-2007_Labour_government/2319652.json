        "background": "Why should we pay upto (and over in some areas) \u00a35 a day for the privalidge of parking our cars...as well as paying road tax, and tax on petrol?\nAND why should we have our tax money wasted on things like employing traffic wardens who half the time dont even do their job properly anyway?\nI paid a \u00a330 parking fine for something that the council eventually admited i didnt do wrong in the 1st place...i never got a refund though!!\nPlaces like America dont employ traffic wardens and dont have parking charges in many of their car parks and they get along just fine...they also dont charge road tax.\nWhy does our government think we are sponges that they can bleed dry every time they overspend???????",
