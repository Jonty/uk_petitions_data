            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "To assist in the preventing the unnecessary purchase and use of 4 Wheel  Drive Jeep/Off Road vehicles with predominantly high carbon emissions and low safety standards on urban roadways.  The extra weight of these vehicles compared to \"standard\" cars accelerates the decay of road surfaces.  Pedestrians injured by these vehicles are at a far greater risk of serious injury and death compared to a standard passenger saloon car.\n\nThe road tax increase would provide an estimated income of \u00a393.5m for 2005 registered vehicles alone.  This money could be re-invested in re-engineering public transport or the support of green initiatives.\n\nWe, the undersigned, believe that the UK would be a safer, greener and less congested country without \"Chelsea Tractors\"",
