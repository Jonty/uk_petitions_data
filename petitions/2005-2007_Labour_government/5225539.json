            "background": "The proposed olympic logo, designed at the exorbitant cost of \u00a3400,000, has recieved universally bad press; and for good reason. The logo has no wide appeal, conveys nothing about England or London, and has failed to excite or engage the public; some of the most important things this symbol should do. Within hours of the release of this logo a plethora of better versions, done on PCs in offices and homes across the UK and the world, had appeared on the BBC and other websites, showcasing the talents that were not used in the design of the \"official\" logo, and also highlighting how much better the official logo could be.\n\nPlease, for the sake of what is quite likely going to be the most significant international event the UK will host this coming decade, please review the logo, and consider changing it to something less gaudy, and with more heart.",
