        "action": "instruct the relevant body to replace the current Retail Price Index used to calculate increases in pensions and benefits, with an Essentials Price Index as suggested by Lord Oakshott in September",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current R.P.I. includes items such as champagne, plasma TVs, and private education; it must be obvious that people on State benefits and pensions can't even dream of being able to afford such things and yet the price of these has increased far more slowly than the sort of thing which would be included on an Essential Prices Index such as gas, electricity, etc.  For instance I'm on Pension Credit and recently received my year-end gas budget plan statement which demanded an increase in my monthly payments from \u00a340 to \u00a352; an increase of 30% which is almost 10 times the 3.6% pension increase and almost 7 times the 4.1% increase in Pension Credit.  This situation is probably repeated in pension and benefits households all over the country; personally I can't even afford to have my hair cut let alone buy a plasma T.V!",
