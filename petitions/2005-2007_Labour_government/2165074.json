        "background": "I think it is unfair that owners of 4x4 vehicles should be victimised for using them on the road.  I own a 4x4 and use it for towing a horse trailer for my business and for pleasure towing a caravan throughout the summer. I can't afford a second car and so I do shop and school run. It should be up to the manufacturers to make them more inviromentally friendly. I know a lot of people own them unnecessary but Rollers and sports cars and privately owned commercial vehicles will be next stop this now and make a differance or we will all be driving government produced uniformed cars next.",
