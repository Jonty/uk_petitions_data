            "background": "Many people are prevented from carrying on their education because they can't afford the high travel costs. Whilst EMA and other such funds exist, they are often not awarded to those who really need them due to administative errors. People in further education should have the right to free travel so they can choose where they want to study based on the quality of the education offered, not on how close it is. This would also encourage more people to stay on into further education.",
