A hen enters a cage at 18 -20 weeks and will remain in the cage for an average of 52 weeks before slaughter.\n\nEach hen has less space than an A4 piece of paper in which to move around, leaving: no room to flap and stretch, no means to dust bathe,no perch on which to roost,no nest to lay an egg in (they never actually see what they produce).",
