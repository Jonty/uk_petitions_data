This is a response from the Government. \n\nThe Government has reached no decisions yet about whether we will introduce a national road pricing scheme and what the rules might be. First we want to pilot road pricing in a number of local areas. \n\nSeveral local authorities are at an early stage in developing their ideas for local pricing pilots, but it is too soon to know whether they will propose charging motorcycles or not. London has decided not to charge motorcycles. As proposals emerge from local authorities we will consider whether we need to set any central rules or offer guidance on discounts and exemptions.\n\n\nFurther information\n\n[http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page10961.asp More on road pricing and the Government's transport policy]\n\n[http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/roads/roadpricing/debate/ Department for Transport road pricing pages]\n\n[http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page36.asp Get all the latest news from No.10 by subscribing to our email service]\n\n[http://www.pm.gov.uk/ Prime Minister's Office homepage]",
