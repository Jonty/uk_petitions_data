        "background": "Currently it is not possible to have broadband internet without also having a phone line and paying line rental for it (except on cable which is not always available). I urge the government to force offcom and/or telecoms companies to provide a different pricing structure that has cheaper line rental for broadband only customers.  For example, rather than \u00a311 line rental; \u00a35.50 for the phone and \u00a35.50 for broadband line rental with the choice to take just one service.",
