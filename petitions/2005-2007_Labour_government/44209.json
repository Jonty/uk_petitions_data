        "background": "Can the Prime Minister give serious consideration to setting a date for the phasing-out of petrol-powered vehicles, such as cars, taxis, industrial vehicles (tractors, etc.) and lorries? Of course, to be viable, this date would have to be many years in the future, perhaps even something like 2056, to enable people to convert their current engines to biofuel, or buy an electrically-powered vehicle or, indeed, decide to use public transport instead. \n\nI think setting this date, telling the world and her car manufacturers about it and ploughing money into our public transport infrastructure, will galvanise car makers into adopting either the electric-, biofuel- or hydrogen-powered engine across their range of cars. I believe, instead of punitively taxing motorists, the government should be pressing car manufacturers to 'go green'. This seems an achievable way in which to reduce the Co2 emissions from automobiles.",
