            "background": "For 48 years the US has subjected Cuba to sustained interference in its internal affairs. The US sponsored an invasion in the early years of the Revolution, and has passed legislation inflicting sanctions on any country or individual who trades with Cuba. This has starved the Cubans of many materials, from pharmacuticals to tractors. There is also the continued presence of a US Navy and Marine base at Guant\u00e1namo on Cuban territory.\n\nUS hostility to Cuba has increased despite SIX specific UN General Assembly resolutions, passed with overwhelming majorities and almost no opposition, demanding the total, immediate and unconditional lifting of the US blockade.\n\nWe call upon the Prime Minister to stand shoulder to shoulder with the rest of the world and call upon the USA to respect Cuban independance and to remove the economic blockade. We also call upon the Prime Minister to set an example to the rest of the world and to establish trading links with Cuba.",
