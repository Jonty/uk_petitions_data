            "background": "It's the ONLY way to make drivers pay for their road usage in a fair and balanced way.\n\nRoad tax is based partly on engine size, bigger engines need more fuel. High road usage equates to high fuel consumption. Businesses that require heavy road usage can be discounted by returning fuel duty.\n\nThere's no need to track a vehicle with  unproven technologies to check which roads it's been used on and how many miles it should pay for.\n\nEven road tax dodgers won't be able to dodge the fuel tax, so people currently breaking the law will have to have to pay as well.\n\nIf you want to lower congestion, improve the public transport systems and hike the cost of fuel in that area. This will force people out of their car and onto a bus.\n\nYou know it makes sense...",
