I love living here and am proud of what it has to offer.\n\nAs Tony said:\nWhen people see the new brand, we want them to be inspired to make a positive change in their life!\n\nThe new London 2012 Olympic Logo does the exact opposite, it does not inspire, it is dull, cheap looking and says nothing positive about London. It is a pathetic attempt at creating a \"brand\" which looks like a Blue Peter 2minute children\u2019s task. London is a city of innovation and perhaps the only good thing that has come out creating a horrid looking logo is that the most of England have put forward their ideas. Obviously shows they care, not that they needed to show it... although it\u2019s great to see once in a while!\n\nTony, do the admiral thing and tell the London Olympic Committee to scrap this logo.",
