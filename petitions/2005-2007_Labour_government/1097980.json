            "background": "Councils don't make it easy to pay for parking and congestion charge. In other countries (e.g. Singapore) charges are deducted from an account automatically, here it becomes a tax on memory. Some parking meters don't give change or take cards (even the big ones in some parking lots) - one has to pay more and predict how long they will stay.\n\nPaying for these 'services' is expensive anyway, so it is often shocking to have a PCN. Especially when the PCN has no amount limit and is worded like a blackmail (the jist being pay up quick or pay double).\n\nIn London, one is forced to pay the congestion charge if one uses a car.  Residents pay \u00a30.80 a day, but will be charged \u00a3100 for forgetting to pay (same amount as for non-residents) - 125 times the original amount. If it was paid the next day the penalty is \u00a310 - 12.5 times the amount. This is completely out of proportion with the 'offence'.\n\nThere should be a limit on any/all penalties exacted by councils and congestion charge companies.",
