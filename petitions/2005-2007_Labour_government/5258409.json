            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "If more police were patrolling the roads they would deter bad driving (deliberate or otherwise), including agressive behaviour, phone use, drinking whilst moving, bad positioning, ignoring road signs and lines, holding up traffic and excessive speed and dangerous driving. The cost of this could be funded from the savings in accidents, removing speed humps, painting of lines and road engineering obstacles, including their maintenance - a secondary benefit would be the discovery of other crimes including lack of insurance, MOT, driving whilst under the influence of drugs and also non-motoring offences.",
