            "background": "This government is always telling us that we must save more towards our retirement. The fact that pensions are taxed is no encouragement whatsoever. We work all our life and pay tax on salaries along with NH contributions then on retirement we get told that our pensions are classed as taxable income. Why? as pensioners we struggle to pay our way so tax relief would be very welcome and some of us would be less of a drain on government funds in the way of subsidies to try to keep our heads above water.",
