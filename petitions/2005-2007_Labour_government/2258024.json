            "background": "The English Bill of Rights was instituted to protect something the English hold dear - the rights of the individual against unjust exploitation by those in authority abusing their positions for personal gain. A key extract reads: \"All grants and promises of fines and forfeitures before trial are illegal and void\"\nYet Millions of motorists every year  allow their rights under this bill to be violated. Each time a body of authority issues a fixed penalty speeding ticket or parking fine, or siezes a person's car demanding a large ransom for its return, that person is being judged, found guilty, and robbed by a faceless system without a fair trial or the chance to defend themselves. This is abhorrent to our people, and we demand that we again be allowed to enjoy the freedom from injustice that The Bill of Rights has promised us.",
