            "background": "Doctors wear their street clothes into hospitals and examine and treat patients in these clothes. They are allowed to go from patient to patient in clothes that have not been laundered at the correct temperature to kill germs (home machines don't go this high) and they are also allowed to leave the hospital, go to pubs and restaurants and food outlets and back to the hospital with germs sticking to their clothing.\n\nWe call on the government to require all doctors (with exception for outpatients depts, psychiatrists and the like) to wear a uniform such as theatre scrubs which would be left at the hospital each day to be professionaly laundered and that would be illegal to wear in public places. \n\nMore people die each year due to preventable hospital acquired infections than in ALL the road traffic accidents for the whold nation! This is a joke when we consider that a lot of these can be prevented.",
