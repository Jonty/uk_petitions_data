        "background": "My main reason for creating this petition is that the charity LIFE, which supports pregnant women, is VIRULENTLY against choice on abortion and this is not stated ANYWHERE in their advertisements.  If that is their stance I reluctantly accept that they have a right to hold it; but in that case they should fully publicise the fact so that only women who have decided NOT to have an abortion will seek their help.  There may be other charities to which something similar applies.",
