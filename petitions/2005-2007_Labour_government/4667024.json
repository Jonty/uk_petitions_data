            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Since Jan 06 Greater Manchester fire service have been operating a 'Drive & Arrive' Policy. Pumps within GMC no longer turn on Blues & Twos to Schools, Hospitals, Airports and Domestics unless stating persons or property of value are involved, Speed limits are to be abided. All turnouts, regardless of the origin of the call/ incident,are strong relevance on 'sleeping risks' not 'life risks'. Since this policy has been introduced Firefighters in GMC are aware of a large number of incidents that could of been handled differently, and would have had significantly better outcomes had they used Blues&Twos. Examples; May 06' - Automatic fire alarm at a primary school in Offerton one pump attended at speed limit - School destroyed. Sept 06' - Small open fire in a lorry yard,Salford, one pump attendance normal road speed (as per policy)Ended up as 15 pumps, 8-7 HGV's & 2 Buildings destroyed. Xmas Eve 06'- Food packaging company, one pump normal road speed (as per policy)Ended up as 4 pumps & 2 aerials. Business Destroyed. Millions of pounds worth of goods and services, along with many jobs have gone up in smoke. Very soon people, along with Firefighters, will die as a result of this policy.",
