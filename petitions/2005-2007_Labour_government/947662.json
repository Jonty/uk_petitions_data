            "background": "This petition is pressing for the introduction of African and Caribbean history into the British curriculum and the system of higher education.  The reason being is that if we have the study of German and American history in the curriculum, why haven't we got the study of Africa and Caribbean history? Introducing such a subject will give all pupils and teachers of every creed and every race to educate themselves on Africa and Caribbean and their history.  Such subjects will allow students who study history to have a wider range of choices in the history that their taught. \nThe study of Africa and Caribbean history and its rich culture should be embraced across the curriculum scope in all higher education institutions.",
