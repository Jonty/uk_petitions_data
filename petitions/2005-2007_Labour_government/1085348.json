            "background": "In the past few days we have witnessed a disgraceful demonstration of the lack of respect for the rule of Law and other people's property from a section of the British public with the looting of property from the cargo of the stricken ship Napoli.\nAdditionally, the Police appear to have done little to enforce the law by failing to arrest the people concerned despite ample photographic evidence of the wrongdoing that has been occurring.\nThe Home Secretary is responsible to the country for providing security, which in this and many other instances he has singularly failed to do.  This incompetence gives entirely the wrong impression and encourages the lawless behaviour we have been witnessing",
