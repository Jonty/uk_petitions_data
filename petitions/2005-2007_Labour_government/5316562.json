            "background": "Financial Institutions are abusing their power by carrying out credit checks on prospective employees.\n\nWe find this discriminatory and unnessasary as any illegal as any fraud convictions would show up on a criminal record check.\n\nIt does not affect a persons ability to do the job if during periods of unemployment and hardship they are unable to keep up payments.\n\nbanks and finacial companies should be encouraging these people back into work, so they can resume their payments which would benifit all concerned.\n\nThese checks are only allowed to carry out these checks in security specific roles, However banks are doing these checks on all employees.",
