            "background": "The government should bring in legislation to stop people who have never paid taxes in the UK from claiming benefits. There should be a minimum qualification period of seven years during which tax must be paid, young people can be covered by their parents eligibility until seven years after leaving full time education. Those who do not qualify but wish to calim should be made to do useful community work to repay what they claim. Immigrants must work the statutory seven years before qualifying for state help. The only exemption would be education and necessary medical treatments. We must stop too many people living off too few taxpayers.",
