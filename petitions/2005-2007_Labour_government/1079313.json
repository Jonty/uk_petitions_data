            "background": "In many of Britain's cities, and especially in the capital, the pavements are seemingly overrun by slow walkers. As they are currently allowed to walk in a haphazard fashion across the entire breadth of the pavement, in an entirely uncontrolled manner, this has the effect of slowing down the whole pedestrian traffic. A system of slow and fast lanes would ease this problem, enabling those in a rush, or with a faster than average walking speed, to get to their destination unfettered by the more leisurely pedestrian. If successful, an additional third \"cruising\" lane could be introduced.",
