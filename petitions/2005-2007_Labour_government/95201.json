            "background": "The current ban on semi-automatic rifles and the classification of multi-shot shotguns as section 1 firearms has achieved nothing on reducing gun crime. Since the 1988 Act gun crime has risen dramaticly, almost all caused by weapons imported and used illegally. Removing legal firearms from secure gun cabinets does not reduce crime: Targeting guns held by criminals and reducing lillegal imports would reduce crime.",
