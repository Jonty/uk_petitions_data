            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We strongly request that the above decision is reviewed. One of the reasons the Housing Grants Act of 1996 was introduced was to protect the smaller sub-contractors cash flow and reduce the number of Insolvencies within the Construction Industry. As an agent acting on behalf of the Insolvency Industry, the Act also protected a level of creditor funds to be made available upon insolvency, due to the strict payment provisions within the Act. In short upon an insolvency event the employer could withhold further payments i.e not yet due which is fair, but not withhold monies that should have been released prior to the insolvency event. Again this would seem fair and in some cases could avoid the insolvency event in the first place.\n\nWe therefore request that a review of this decision in the hope that the Act be upheld and not discarded based upon the 'potential' of a future event yet to occur.",
