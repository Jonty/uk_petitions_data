            "background": "As a way to stop the mindless villains from making our lives a misery. I propose that the use of Stocks and Pillories be reintroduced; it would dissuade them from behaving in a anti-social way, and give a boost to the flagging sales of rotten fruit. I feel that after a few days out in the weather for the crime, and being laughed at and pelted with rotten fruit, most people would think twice about being a total pain.",
