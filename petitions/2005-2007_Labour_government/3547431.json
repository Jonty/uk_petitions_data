This has lent to enourmous teasing, but he has just got on with it and deserves massive respect for it.  This unlying desire to get on with the job in hand, has led to his determined attitude on the engerneering front, he has recently won 'Lancashire Sparky of The Year' which he recieved from fellow baldy Duncan Goodhew.  Couregeous as well as hard working, 'CJ' as he is affectionatly know should be nationally recognised for his achievements after all you have given an MBE to a lollypop man before!!",
