            "background": "The NHS is being privatised by stealth, although the government uses the cunning tactic of claiming that healthcare is still free at its point of delivery, this is an underhand and dishonest policy.\n\nThe increased role of the private sector has never been debated openly and has never been subject to the proper democratic process.\n\nThe NHS will be left as merely a funding mechanism for private corporations if nothing is done.\n\nI would urge the prime minsiter to put this debate before the people of this country, so that we can decide whether this campaign of privatisation should be allowed to continue.\n\nOr should we have a referendum that asks: \"Should NHS funds be used to pay for NHS work to be carried out by the private sector?\"\n\nIf there is an ounce of democracy left then I would sincerely hope that the slide can be halted, before we have nothing left of an institution that many of us hold very close to our hearts.",
