            "background": "do not have to wait for up to 45+ minutes to cross junction 3 heading towards Bagshot from Lightwater/West End. The traffic controls on junction 3 currently favour those coming off the M3 or the Bagshot side of the A322. The timing of the light changes do not allow more than two or three cars at a time to make it on to the junction before the next set of lights change. This causes enormous tail backs, it also means that a number of drivers perform illegal u turns across the central reservation and on to the West End bound carriageway of the A322. A large number of motorists (including myself, I'm ashamed to say) take an alternative route through the villages of Lightwater, Windlesham and Bagshot turning these villages in to 'rat runs' between 07:00 and 09:00 most weekdays just to avoid the queues. Change the Junction, you are at the M4 Junction 11 to ease similar congestion issues.",
