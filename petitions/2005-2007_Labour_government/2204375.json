            "background": "As a tax-free alternative to other proposed methods of reducing road congestion, the control of driving licences should be implemented such that a fixed maximum number are in issued at any one time, and that to receive a licence a queue must be joined.  Loss of a driving licence (due to a conviction) would require rejoining the queue after the sentence period.",
