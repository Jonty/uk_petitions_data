            "background": "My husband has recently started watching a Cable channel which is exclusively about crimes commited in America.  This consists of police officers talking about crimes they have been involved with but they also describe the crimes themselves in great detail; these crimes seem to be mainly, or even exclusively, sexual and/or violent crimes against women.  My main concern is that this may lead to copy-cat crimes; in my opinion the ONLY justification for such programmes is the possibility of solving the crimes but the one I've described seems purely voyeuristic.",
