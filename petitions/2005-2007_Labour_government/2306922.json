        "action": "outlaw the practice whereby people who see hospital consultants privately, when given a non-NHS prescription for medication are then permitted to take it to their GP and get it transferred to an NHS Prescription Form",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Private prescriptions issued by hospital consultants must be paid for, in full, by the patient regardless of any entitlement to reduced or free medication under the NHS.  Because these patients can currently, legally, get their GP to transfer the details of the private prescription to an NHS form it allows them to avoid the high costs charged by pharmacists were they to ask for the medications to be dispensed under the private prescription.  This passes the cost of the private sector in medicines back to the taxpayer through the NHS and should not be allowed.  Privately funded medical treatment should remain privately funded, in all its forms, from start to finish of the episode of care.",
