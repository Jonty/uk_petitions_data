        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In the past year we have seen a tremendous rise in the reclaiming of unfair and illegal penalties from banks. An estimated \u00a3500M has been repaid without apparantly 1p. being contested at law.\n\nWithout control and against Common Law, banking institutions have, without any responsuibility, principles or morals, systematically ripped off the British public for their own greedy benefit.\n\nThe Government appears to have allowed and even condoned this.\n\nWe therefore call  on the Government to tighten up, to a leakproof point, the regulations controlling our financial institutions, so that this scandalous finacial rape of private citizens monies can never be repeated.\n\nWe further petition that the banking institutions guilty of deducting illegal penalties from the public, be forced, at the pain  of massive penalties, to refund to its customers such deductions, together with interest, which have been made over the past 6 years.",
