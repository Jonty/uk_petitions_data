Mode S transponders identify the aircraft that is transmitting, enabling it to be traced and providing Controllers with information about aircraft type, speed and performance.\n\nFor most owners of light aircraft, fitting a Mode S transponder is an additional cost (between \u00a3700 and \u00a33,000) without any benefit. The advantage is to airlines and other commercial operators, who won\u2019t have to pay anything. \n\nWe request that the Prime Minister asks for a review of this by his Ministerial colleagues.",
