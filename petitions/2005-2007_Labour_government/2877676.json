By moving the date of Christmas to February we have a greater chance of seeing snow on Christmas Day.\n\nThe last calendar quarter of the year is already congested with Halloween, Guy Fawkes Night, Winter Solstice and New Years celebrations. February is relatively quiet in comparison and would help to bridge the long gap between the New Year and Easter.",
