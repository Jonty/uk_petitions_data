Nor will there be any meaningful oversight by technically competent bodies. In its precipitate haste to meet a self-imposed deadline (May 2007), the government has ignored calls both from The Electoral Commission and from its own vendors to allow more time for implementation.\n\nE-voting introduces new risks and uncertainties, and may provide opportunities for fraud with the introduction of a unproven technology - \u201cA secure internet voting system is theoretically possible, but it would be the first secured networked application ever created in the history of computers\u201d, Bruce Schneier.\n\nFor more see: openrightsgroup.org",
