        "background": "There are around 300,000 postgraduate students in the UK, compared to the 2.1 million undergraduates - the vast majority of which receive student loan funding. Adding postgraduate loans would not be difficult given the system already in place. Obtaining some of the limited funding available through the existing avenues (research councils, charity bursaries etc) is incredibly difficult and makes postgraduate study an impractical and expensive route for most people.",
