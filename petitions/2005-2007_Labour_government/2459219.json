        "background": "After watching the news today and seeing the story of Casey Leigh Mullen who was raped and murdered I felt sick. As the mother of two young children I firmly beleive we need to take a strong stand and let these people know this will not be tolerated in our society. These Monsters need to be locked away until the day they die. All child killers and Peadophiles are as bad as one another. If someone can touch a child in an inappropriate way the next time they may rape them. After that they may murder them.\nAs a Mother and a human being I believe it is my right and the right of all Children and parents that these people be locked away and NEVER see the light of day again. Even if you do not have children please sign this petition. Thankyou",
