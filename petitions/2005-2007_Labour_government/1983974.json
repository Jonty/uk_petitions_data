            "background": "It is long time for us to stop moaning about global warming and gridlock on our roads and do something about it. Too many people are making unnecessary journeys. Our way of life is threatened by politics that are dominated by international oil politics, including problems in the Middle East. This puts at risk a peaceful multicultural nation. By reducing our consumption of fossil fuels, we can reverse the trend. It is not feasible to expect individuals, reared in a culture of self-interest to voluntarily give up something they consider a right, including exceeding speed limits. A more practical way is to raise the cost of travel to its true level. If we cannot rely on the foresight of caring individuals to protect our environment then it falls to our government to change the law to oblige us to conserve fuel. A modest inconvenience to us all may save our skins in the long term.",
