            "background": "Currently, my taxes support faith based schools to which my children will never have access to. I am part of a small minority which does not operate any schools in Britain. My children will have no access to schools operating strict faith based entrance criteria but I have to pay taxes to support those schools. I was taught in a Catholic convent in Kenya with fellow pupils who practised Christianity, Islam, Hinduism and other minority religions. That taught me tolerance and gave me an understanding of other faiths. The current system in the UK just breeds ghettos.",
