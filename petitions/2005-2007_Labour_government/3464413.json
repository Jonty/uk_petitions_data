        "background": "This is an International Development issue for developing countries, especially Southern nations.\n\nVulture Funds are debts sold cheaply by creditors to companies who may then legally demand immediate payment by the debtor. Zambia have been told that a company called Donegal International, based in the British Virgin Islands, have a legal right to payment from them of around $15-20 million. This debt was bought by Donegal for $3.3 million when the debt itself was to be written off.\n\nThe payment of this debt will stifle spending on development in Zambia. Millions of people will suffer so that a few already rich people will benefit. This is an injustice.",
