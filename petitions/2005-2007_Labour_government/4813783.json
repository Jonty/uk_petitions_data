            "background": "Many of the food stuffs farmed and grown in this country are, in the public interest subject to a wide variety of rules and regulations.  However much of what is sold in our supermarkets comes from foreign markets devoid of these regulations.  In essence, the use of growth promoters has been banned in your British grown beef - however much of that sold in supermarkets across the country comes from countries with very lax regulations in South America.  The laws were intorduced here for our protection, can we please extend them to cover all imports.  This should also have the knock on effect of driving up costs for foreign suppliers and improving the UKs dwindling agriculture economy.  After all what else do we produce in Britain these days?  And surely a country that ceases to produce anything is creating a one way cash flow overseas - how sustainable is this?",
