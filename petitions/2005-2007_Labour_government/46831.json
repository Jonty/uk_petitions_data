            "background": "It is unfair that only everyday working people face the threat to their jobs posed by mass immigration, orchestrated by the current government at the behest of 'business leaders'. If politicians really wish to understand the concerns of the people they represent, create a new classes of Highly Skilled Migrants, such as politicians, journalists, university lecturers, and open up the legal profession to allow recruitment of the 'highly talented' people we are repeatedly told want to move to the UK.\n\nIt is unfair for the political classes to make judgement on the effects of immigration, when they are completely shielded from any negative effects. Competition amongst the legal profession, and potential local and central government representatives, must surely be a good thing; after all, we have been repeatedly lectured that it is imperative within every other possible career to ensure the UK remains a 'world leader'.",
