            "background": "When the London Mayor was created it was on a minority support of Greater London electors, less than 25% supported the idea and 500,000 voted No in the referendum. The Government are currently pursuing legislation which gives yet more powers to the Mayor by grabbing powers from the democratically elected London Boroughs. For example the Boroughs will no longer have to be consulted on housing and the Mayor will be able to over-rule the London Boroughs on Planning Matters. Every consultation and opinion poll in London has consistently shown that this is not required by electors.",
