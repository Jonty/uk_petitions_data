        "background": "I am a motorist who has become continually frustrated at repair bills for my cars suspension as a result of the increasing trend for local councils to install speed humps around the city of which I travel. As well as not working these traffic calming measures are an annoyance and are costing me hundreds of pounds each year to fix or re-adjust my suspension.
