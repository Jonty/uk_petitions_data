            "background": "Rugby is an exciting game but only if both teams play for trys. It becomes dull when a team stops the game for 5mins to set up and convert a penalty kick. Unfortunately with a successful penalty being worth 3 points, more and more are being taken resulting in increasingly dull games. Reducing the award for a penalty to 1 point keeps the exciting option of scoring a late winning point whilst removing the temptation to base a team's tactics around them.",
