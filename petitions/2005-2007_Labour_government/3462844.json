        "background": "According to What Car? magazine, in 2005 there was a marginal drop of 1% in road fatalities in the UK, down to 3201. ESP would help drive down these figures further.\n\nESP is an 'active vehicle safety system' and a further enhancement to the anti-lock braking (ABS) system. ESP reduces the risk of skids and slides during cornering and helps to keep a car on track even in extreme conditions, for example on wet or icy roads.",
