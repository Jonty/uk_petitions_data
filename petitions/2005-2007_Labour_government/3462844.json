ESP would help drive down these figures further.\n\nESP is an 'active vehicle safety system' and a further enhancement to the anti-lock braking (ABS) system. ESP reduces the risk of skids and slides during cornering and helps to keep a car on track even in extreme conditions, for example on wet or icy roads.",
