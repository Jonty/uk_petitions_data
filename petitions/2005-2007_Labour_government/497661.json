        "background": "As the heading states, instead of sending criminals to jail to play on their playstations, chat on their mobile phones, watch Sky TV and ply snooker, why not send them to Iraq to do something useful like protect our servicemen by doing all the dangerous jobs.\n\nTasks such as escorting food/supply trucks or clearing out land mines etc.  A few months of that as opposed to a few years of luxury at prison might make people think twice about committing a crime in the first place.",
