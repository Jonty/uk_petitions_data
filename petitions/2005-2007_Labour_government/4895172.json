It seems that companies dig up a road, put up traffic lights and leave it for a couple of weeks then spend one day finishing their job. This must cost the country millions in lost time in arriving to our daily jobs late. There are not always warnings of impending road works either. Make it law that road works must be worked on 24hrs until completion to avoid prolonged congestion and eventually gridlock!",
