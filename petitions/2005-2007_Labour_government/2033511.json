        "background": "Pancreatic Illness is one of if not the worst Illness and most pancreatic problems are not cureable.For instance Chronic/Acute Pancreatitis or Pancreatic Cancer. Most of the time it is too late once diagnosed, so researchers need funding to find out how and why this Cancer is appearing. It has taken so many people lately including a member of my family and i also suffer from Chronic Pancreatitis,I was diagnosed at the age of 21, 10yrs ago.I also have diabetes and am now awaiting for many other tests to be carried out. We live in a world where technology, science and mankind has progressed soo far that we have even developed stem cells.\n\nIn the US they have been experimenting and they have been funded.  As we have an illness does that mean that we are not entitled to funding and the government helping us to help ourselves???  Please e-mail as many people as you know to get this petition signed.",
