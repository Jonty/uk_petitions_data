        "background": "I am sick of not being able to buy concert tickets at the face value because as soon as they go on sale the touts buy them all unfairly and then sell them on Ebay at vast profit, leaving genuine fans ticketless or out of pocket\nTake That tickets sold out - how? All the legitimate ticket agencies' websites crashed so how did people manage to buy them. I don't think there is an even footing here for fans to buy tickets - I think the touts hack into the sites and block genuine fans from buying. Please do something to stop this expoitation immediately!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
