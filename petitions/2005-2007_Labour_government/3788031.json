All the legitimate ticket agencies' websites crashed so how did people manage to buy them. I don't think there is an even footing here for fans to buy tickets - I think the touts hack into the sites and block genuine fans from buying. Please do something to stop this expoitation immediately!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
