        "background": "I'm sure everyone is aware that the amount Local Authorities have to spend is limited; (though this might be so to a lesser extent if people weren't so reluctant to pay Council Tax that some Councils, such as mine in Camden, have promised - and imposed! - a freeze in order to win local elections).  Culture and heritage may be important but such things as social housing, clearing roads - and pavements! - of snow and ice in winter, etc., are FAR more so.",
