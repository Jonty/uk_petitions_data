Indicating before and until FULLY completing ALL manouevres - motorway lane changers, taxi/bus drivers and, frighteningly, emergency services drivers, please take note!!\nFailure to indicate an intention to manouevre, or indeed failing to cancel an indication, should be made a spot fine no points offence. People only learn when they are hit in the wallet!\n\nE.G. cyclists not in a designated cycle lane who undertake stopped or slow moving traffic, or mount the pavement to \"dodge\" adverse traffic lights! You are casualties waiting to happen!",
