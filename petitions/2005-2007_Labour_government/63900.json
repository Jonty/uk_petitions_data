        "background": "For the past few years the lucrative music market at Christmas has been dominated by manufactured TV tie-in 'acts'. We know that the Prime Minister can play the guitar, so how about releasing a song this Christmas to give us a change at the top of the singles charts? This would be great for the British recording industry and would also, I am sure, increase younger voters' interest in politics.",
