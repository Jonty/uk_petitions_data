            "background": "Our Autistic children are not being supported properly in mainsteam schools because the teachers are not trained well unenough. The teachers are under enough pressure as it is and to get the extra help autistic children need is by a statement which the goverment are telling councils not to write due to cost. \nTo best support these children I say to the goverment, that more units are needed. \nTheir are some many children who need the units, but due to not enough spaces not all children get this.\nThe goverment is failing our Autistic children and we as parents must stop this. Help by signing this petition and hopefully the goverment may listen.",
