            "background": "I believe that Jamie Oliver has worked hard, in a diligent and selfless manner in regard to the  school dinner campaign in particular, and in helping build self esteem and confidence in underpriviledged young people in general through his schemes for getting them in to the workplace through his work training/placement restaurants.   Both are worthy reasons, but especially the school dinner campaign, as it is so important to the up-coming generation to learn to eat healthily for their own future as well as the future  of our nation.",
