        "background": "The capture of British soldiers by Iranian Revolutionary Guards on Friday was, if the evidence provided is to be believed, cowardly, premeditated, and illegal. As such, in accordance with the widely-accepted policy of \"no negotiations with terrorists\", Britain should reject any offer that Iran makes (which many analysts believe is inevitable), in particular a 'trade', whereby we are guaranteed the safe return of our soldiers in return for the release of detained Revolutionary Guards.\n\nThis would be 'caving in' by the Blair government, and would be a grave error of judgement were it to occur.\n\nSo, we the undersigned, plead for Mr Blair and his cabinet to show their resolute defiance in the face of cowardly acts of terrorism, and ensure the safe return of our soldiers without compromising our own security in the future.",
