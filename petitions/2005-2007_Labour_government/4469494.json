            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The school spring holiday in 2008 does not include the Easter weekend.  Without consultation with parents it has been moved in most counties to two weeks after Easter next year.  This will cause hardship to all employed parents as they will have to take extra leave (in many cases, unpaid), to care for their children, whereas teachers could potentially get two extra paid days off as their holiday will now include the Easter bank holidays, plus two further weeks .  We therefore ask that the Spring (Easter) holiday be moved back to its traditional dates for 2008, or to start on Good Friday and end two weeks later.  The move by the government, teaching unions and Education authorities to move this holiday is without precedent, and therefore we ask that it should be moved back to include Easter in 2008.",
