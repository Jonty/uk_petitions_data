        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Government's target for a maximum waiting time of 4 hours for patients to be admitted, transferred or discharged  in NHS Accident & Emergency (A&E) departments is arbitrary and distorts clinical priorities.\n \nThere is no scientific or clinical evidence behind the choice of 4 hours as a universal upper limit.\n\nThis 4-hour A&E target is one of the most damaging NHS targets because meeting the target has become the priority in many NHS trusts, not the provision of high quality medical care in a time frame appropriate to the clinical condition.\n\nHow long a patient waits should be decided by clinical staff on the frontline in our hard-pressed A&E departments, not from the offices of the Department of Health.\n\nThe 4-hour A&E waiting time target is perverse and should be scrapped.",
