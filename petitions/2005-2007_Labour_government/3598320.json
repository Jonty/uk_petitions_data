The combined effects of these policies currently see some 200 bingo clubs under threat of closure.\n\nBingo clubs are a key aspect of local communities, providing a safe environment for a predominantly female audience, in addition to which they also employ over 22,000 people throughout the UK and contribute over \u00a3270 milion annually to the Treasury.\n\nConsumer research has shown that communities value their bingo club, Government must take action and rethink its approach to regulation and taxation of the industry.",
