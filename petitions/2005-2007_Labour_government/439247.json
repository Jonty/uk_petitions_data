        "background": "I am a Paramedic.  We are very often called to residents of flats where we are unable to get the patient out on our stretcher.  Obviously we have chair devices for this situation, but in some situations i.e. Cardiac Arrest, or spinal injuries these are far from ideal.  It would be simple at the design phase to simply make the lifts large enough to accomodate our stretchers, which can only benefit our patients.",
