            "background": "The Prime Minister supported the flying of the English flag, the Cross of St George, from the flag pole of No 10 to support the England team during the World Cup in 2006. We ask that he should also be supportive of the English to have the right to celebrate their national day and have a bank Holiday each 23rd of April. This would ensure that we could celebrate and teach our children about English culture, history and identity. This subject seems to be absent from school curriculum's. We feel its our duty & our human right to encourage & pass on our history, culture and identity to our young people.",
