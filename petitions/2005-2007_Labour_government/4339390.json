            "background": "There is so much traffic on British roads, so that when the simple overtaking manoeuver carried out by lorries means that there will be a build up of faster vehicles behind the lorry. The lorry can take up to ten minutes to overtake a slower vehicle, particularly if the lorry driver chooses a bad point i.e., a long hill.\n\nThe lorries are, by law, prevented to travel at the same speed as cars, in fact they may well be fitted with speed limiters. So why do they need to overtake at all.\n\nThe speed variation between the slower lorry and the quicker may well be only two/three miles an hour different therefore over a 600 mile journey the faster lorry will arrive 34 minutes earlier. Is it worth it?\n\nSo ban lorries from overtaking and ease congestion.",
