            "background": "This petition is to stop Ken Livingstone having the power to keep on putting up the fares on public transport in London. We keep on paying more and more and yet year on year the service gets worse on all forms, while we now have to pay extortionate money to drive our cars through the capital as an alleged 'alternative'. I went to Spain for a year a couple of years ago and upon my return fares had risen substantially, and I could definitely say that the service had worsened in that time. And yet this keeps happening. I think Londoners should say 'enough is enough'.",
