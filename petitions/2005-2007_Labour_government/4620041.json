It should say something like, to use three recent examples, \"Reduce the damage being done to the nation in the name of political correctness\" or \"Award silver jubilee medal to all service personal serving in 1977\" or \"Reduce the fees for late payment of council tax\".  \n\nPlease also remove all the CAPITALS as they make it hard for people to read.\n\nIf you'd like to create a new petition based on these criteria we will re-consider it.",
