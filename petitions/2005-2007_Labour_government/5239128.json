        "background": "It is obvious given the current state of affairs surrounding motorcycling on our roads that people are poorly educated about such things.  Therefore I prepose that government step in and make passing you bike licence manditory before you are eligable to have your car licence.  This should eliminate people in general being misinformed(lets be as silly as these anti bikers and say:- if they don't get their motorcycling licence within 6 months of any legislation like this being brought in, they as a poorly educated driver, should lose their licence)",
