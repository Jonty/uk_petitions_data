        "action": "enact legislation that would see the welfare of children superseding any rights their parents may have or feel they should have.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "No one has any choice about who their parents are or how they treat them; they may abuse the children emotionally, and/or physically, and/or sexually and any or all of these could affect the victim for the whole of his/her life.  As someone who suffered emotional abuse from my own mother I feel, very strongly, that the minimum emotional supports all children need are: love, emotional security, confidence, and high self-esteem; I have come to that conclusion as a result of receiving none of these myself.  I would therefore contend that the mere fact of being a biological (or adoptive) parent should entitle one to nothing; if someone else, or another couple, can give the child(ren) a more loving and secure childhood this is what should happen.",
