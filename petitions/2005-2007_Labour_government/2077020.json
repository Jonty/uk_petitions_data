            "background": "Mental illness is a horrible thing, in all shapes and forms. Over the 2006 summer holidays, my mother was suffering from Bipolar disease. (I'm only ten years old, so you may well take no notice of me) Because of this, me, my older brother and sister had to stay with my divorced father. I tried explaining this to my friends and teachers, but no one understood what I was going through. This was when I decided something HAD to be done! The British public need to know about mental illnesses, incase it happens to someone close to them. Being someone who has gone through this, I can guarantee that this is a horrific experience, seeing someone as close as that change completely. I would like the Government to raise awareness about Downsyndrome to Bipolar disease. They could do this by making children and adults T.V. documentaries about them, to help people understand. Anyone who agrees with me about this, whether its happened to them or they know they should be prepared, PLEASE ignore my age!",
