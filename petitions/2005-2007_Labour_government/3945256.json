            "background": "Since the goverment introduce a law making it illegal to be in possession of a fake firearm in a public place without reasonable excuse, you are now breaking the law if you leave a toy shop with anything that can be called a 'fake firearm' i.e that looks 'a bit' like a real gun.  The fact that you bought it legally in a shop does not count as a reasonable excuse.  Innocent law obiding citizens are finding themselves in court accused accused of charges that could put them in prison. If it is illegal to be in possession of one and yet you can buy one for \u00a32 in a fancy dress shop surely we must change to law to mean that you cannot buy guns that look similar to real guns with at the very least clear warnings on the packaging about what constitutes an offense.",
