        "action": "Look at improving the rail road hub network. So that people can use rail transport as the GOVERNMENT wants! Railway stations must have adequate parking if more passengers are to use the railways - bus routes need to be expanded and improved to railway stations!",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is a stated government objective to reduce congestion and get people using the rail system. In the last few weeks I have tried using the rail system from stations such as Farnborough and Fleet only to find no available car parking space (at 0900hrs!). If we are to use rail transport more often it has to be made easier - there are too many obstacles at present. Improved bus services running to match rail services would help and extending routes to cover most housing estates. If you force us off the roads we have to have a VIABLE efficient low cost alternative!",
