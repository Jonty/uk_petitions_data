        "background": "Those who have been following the media this week cannot fail to know about the debate erupting around the apparent racist abuse aimed at Shilpa Shetty, by fellow housemate Jade Goody.\nTo date, Channel 4 have only raised the issue of possible racism with the housemates, just once, after Jade Goody referred to Shilpa Shetty as 'Shilpa Popadom'. This lack of action isn't acceptable - Channel 4 need to reflect their role as a public service broadcaster, and stand up in defence of other cultures and in the defence and encouragement of tolerance.\nEven if the abuse is determined not to be racist - the act of bullying is to be deplored also, and should be condemned just as strongly.",
