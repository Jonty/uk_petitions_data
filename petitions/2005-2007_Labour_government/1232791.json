            "background": "There are the threats of further cuts within HSE which will further reduce the ability of the organisation to adequately enforce health and safety legislation in the UK.  Workplace accidents have been on a downward spiral, but if the cuts continue this could change.  There are already less than 1,000 frontline inspectors for in excess of 250,000 UK businesses.  Further cuts will destroy this internationally respected organisation.",
