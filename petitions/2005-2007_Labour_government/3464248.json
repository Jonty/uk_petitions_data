        "background": "all to often you sit down to watch a match on tv with your children or when eating, and the camera seems to stay on the footballer just that bit to long and you know what hes going to do,and so does the director in his cabin so why doesnt he switch cameras.\n\nIt is a bad influence on younger children, you see it in the street when you pass some young people they spit on the floor it becomes a habit,its also a health problem with TB on the increase. So lets see a change to directors in charge of live TV sports, to simply switch cameras when they can see what the person is about to do, which is spit or hold one side their nose and empty it.\n\nWe dont need to see that side of the game for younger people its disgusting and needs to be cut out of our viewing.",
