            "background": "1. As the Treason Act 1351 is written in Norman-French, judges over the centuries have had great difficulty interpreting it.  REPEAL it and REPLACE it with a law written in English.\n\n2. RE-ENACT the Treachery Act 1940 so that the offence of treachery is re-named treason, clearly defining what constitutes an enemy, excluding provisions allowing persons to be tried by court-martial and introducing a corroboration provision.\n\n3. In any case, the recommendations of the Law Commission in 1977 with respect to treason should be enacted, namely, that it should be treason for (a) anyone in Britain, (b) any British citizen wherever he might be, and (c) any person ordinarily resident in Britain to intentionally give assistance to the Queen's enemies within Britain or elsewhere, in accordance with how treason is understood in international law.",
