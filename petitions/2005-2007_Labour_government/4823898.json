Customers have laws protecting them for any wrong doing of shops or organisations, but what do we (the staff) have to protect us.  A customer is free to walk into a shop and cause havoc and upset, yet they can play the 'I pay your wages' card.\nSomething needs to be done to get respect from customers, after all, if it wasn't for the staff then they wouldn't get any service at all.",
