        "action": "Put pressure on ALL US government parties to place more stringent restrictions on firearms in light of the Virginia shootings.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is and has always been far too easy for any individual in the US to gain access to firearms, with all too frequent horrific and disturbing consequences.  Regardless of the arguements about Canadian gun laws being similar, the evidence suggests that it is something about certain US mentalities which means picking up a gun and killing someone is all to easy and justified.\nNo single US party will place restrictions on firearms for fear of losing votes from the US public.\nThis petition aims to encourage our government, and hopefully others, to place pressure on ALL US parties to impose greater restrictions on firearms, therefore removing the stigma of being against this so called 'freedom' of owning a gun.  The killings must stop.",
