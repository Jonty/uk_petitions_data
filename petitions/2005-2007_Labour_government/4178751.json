            "background": "Why must 4x4 drivers have to pay more tax when there are family cars out there doing LESS mpg and polluting more than 4x4s. Transmission of a car has nothing to do with pollution so why should we be taxed for it. 95% of 4x4s are also the same size (ground space wise) as an estate car so that should NOT be an excuse. Sign this to make it fair. Either raise the tax on 2 wheel drive cars that pollute a lot to the same level as 4x4\u2019s or lower 4x4 tax to the same as a equal car. DON\u2019T BE 4x4IST!",
