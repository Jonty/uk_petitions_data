This should extend also to flip-flops and any shoes with open toes.\n\nParticularly they should be banned during any month with an 'r' in it. Even last week, when it was still April, we had a bit of sun and they couldn't wait to get them out. 20 years ago hardly anyone wore them. It was no hotter really and yet everyone seemed to manage.\n\nEven during the summer months, they should be banned from at least some places so we have a nice safe haven to go where there won't be any.",
