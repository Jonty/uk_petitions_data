            "background": "Several news agencies have recently reported that the government is planning to bring in compulsory registration of minimotos in an effort to stop them being mis-used on the streets.  This idea is flawed and will not work.  Most minimotos don't have chassis or engine numbers, meaning there is no real way to tell two bikes of the same model apart; registrations could be swapped between bikes with little to no effort.  Most of the people mis-using minimotos simply won't register their bikes.  They know that they are breaking the law already, so why will they register them?\n\nAll these proposals will do is inconvenience riders who currently use their bikes perfectly legally and safely at organised events.\n\nThere are currently more than enough laws in place to keep minimotos off the road and on the track where they belong.  All we need is for the Police to actually enforce them.",
