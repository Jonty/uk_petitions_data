They often err on the side of caution (i.e. generosity), being out of touch with the Real World. \n\nLet those who are affected by the decisions made by MPs decide the pay and allowances... and what better group than a Committee drawn from the National Federation of Old Age Pensioners?  It would concentrate the minds of MPs somewhat,  when deciding the level of the Old Age Pension... currently, UK has one of the lowest OAP pension rates.",
