        "background": "Every member of society has seen nurses and other NHS clinical staff wearing their uniform in public places like food shops and restaurants. The current policy is that this is not allowed.This is due to the biological hazards that such clothing carries with it and that can and does get passed onto the public. \n\nWe call on the PM to enforce this ban and to make breaking it a matter of professional \"fitness to practice\" so that persistant offenders would be barred from practicing thier professions unless they abide by the ban and start putting the health and welfare of the public FIRST and not their own desires first. \n\nAnyone who wears such clothing in public is acting unprofessionally and is acting contrary to the evidence already out there.\n\nPeople dies because of infections CAUSED by health-care staff who are careless. \n\nLet's stop it in it's tracks!",
