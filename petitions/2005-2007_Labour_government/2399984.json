        "background": "I ask the goverment to stop discrimation against smokers. We pay massive taxes in this country which help pay towards the NHS and overpaid Goverment ministers. Now the NHS are starting to say no to operations if you smoke dispite us paying into the NHS. Yet nothing is done against drug users , drunks, or illegal immegrants why? because it is discrmination. So why should smokers not have the right not to be discriminated against.",
