Doctors, nurses and health care workers are also patients and spiritual healing must also be made .available to them as it is of great benefit to those is stressful occupations.\"",

        "background": "There should be a hotline facility initiated whereby patient referral, via GP practices and hospitals is available not only for the treatment of patients but medical staff in need in the form of both an NHS Distant Healing List and for Contact Healing. \n\nIt is logical that Contact Healing facilities should be available in both GP practices and at hospitals, so that hospitalised patients and medical staff can take advantage of them at their 'work place'. \n\nOther patients can obtain healing treatments at GP practices, or, if bed ridden, at home, via a healer in their area attending to their needs. \n\nSpiritual Healing can also reach institutionalised psychiatric patients, those with mental and physical disabilities and those serving custodial sentences in HM Prisons through Distant Healing and - where possible - Contact Healing.",
