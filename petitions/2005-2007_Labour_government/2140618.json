        "background": "More and more people are loosing their homes and loosing their lives due to debt.  This may be our own fault to a point but when a lender can see the financial difficulties that you are under but still decide to offer you \u00a330,000!!, that is not responsible.  I believe that these lenders need to take some responsibility for the way that they foolishly offer more money to people that are obviously struggling.  Debt is a huge problem for a lot of families, so much so that there lives are completely ruined and you basically feel imprisoned in your own home with the added mental pressure from debt collectors. We do not want the Prime Minister to pay all our debts off, we would like some solution apart for IVA's / Bankruptcy or further lending, some thing so we can get our lives back on track, and stop lenders borrowing to people that can not afford it.  This also needs to be taught in our schools the importance of staying in the black and the consequences of falling into the red,",
