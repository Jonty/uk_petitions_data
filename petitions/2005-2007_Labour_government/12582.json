        "background": "To limit unnecessary pollution created by importing food that could be produced in the United Kingdom, a system could be developed of rationing imported food and drink. This, while allowing the public some choice, would limit the amount of imported food purchased in the United Kingdom, thus reducing carbon dioxide emissions harmful to the environment and public health worldwide.\n\nIt would also encourage people to buy local produce and would make them more aware of importation issues.",
