            "background": "MS suffers should be exempt from prescription charges. It is an outrage that suffers of this chronic illness have to pay presciption charges when they may as a result of the illness require a multitude of different drugs to be prescibed for them on a regular basis to treat the numerous conditions that arise because of this illness. In my on case I have to take 7 different drugs on a daily basis to treat the affect of the condition. Each month I would need to pay \u00a345.50 by way of prescription charges, which I forunately avoid as I have a pre payment certificate which I pay for annually. Why should other suffers of chronic illness be exempt when suffers of MS are not?",
