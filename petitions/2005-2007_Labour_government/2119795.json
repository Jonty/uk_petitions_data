            "background": "In addition to moving road tax and third party insurance to fuel duty, and to ensure a fair spread of costs and encourage good driving practices, a sliding scale of fuel costs should be implemented.\nThis can take the form of a compulsory fuel card system, whereby road users who cause accidents, incur traffic offences, and consume more fuel pay a higher price per unit of fuel than those who drive safer and use less fuel.\nThis way each person has a personal fuel pricing value.\nThis will encourage good vehicle usage, limit damage to environment, collect otherwise lost revenue, eradicate evaders, and remove problem of un-insured losses.",
