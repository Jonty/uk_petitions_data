        "background": "It is disgraceful that the UK is one of the greatest contributors finacially to the Eurovision Song Contest, yet we have absolutely no respect from the other countries, who give us very few, if any, points every year since Iraq. It is simply a waste of money as there is no chance we could come anywhere near the top of the list. The only reason we're in it each year is because we provide so much money. So we should simply leave the contest and return only when the other countries stop their ridiculous political voting.",
