            "background": "There is a growing plague of large companies who demand 60 or 90 day payment terms. This forces small suppliers, who need their business, to act as financiers for these companies, in effect they are taking interest free loans from their suppliers. This is putting unfair pressure on the companies who cannot demand these payment terms and forcing many of them out of business. It is also slowing down the country's economy is a totally unfair \"Bully Boy\" practice and needs to be stopped.",
