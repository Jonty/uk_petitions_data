Well guess what, you offend me and countless others by telling me I can't celebrate Christ's birth or even mention it. I bet nobody will ever ban Divali from being celebrated. Belief in God is the most important choice everyone needs to make. Full stop. Wars will come and go, as will Governments and rulers. One thing is certain: Death. Another certainty is that it can be overcome by Christ's resurrection. For God's sake, let us tell people about it and remember Him at every opportunity we can.\nPlease",
