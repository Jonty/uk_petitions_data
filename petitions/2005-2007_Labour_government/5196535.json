            "background": "Many parents in their 50's and 60's are faced with punitive costs for the higher education of their offspring.  In University cities rents for squalid houses are sky high and fees are also oppressive.  Parents are already paying through existing taxes for education and these additional education costs are a secondary tax. They are a considerable burden which should be ameliorated by a reduction in the tax burden through adding tertiary education payments to the tax allowances of those paying them.",
