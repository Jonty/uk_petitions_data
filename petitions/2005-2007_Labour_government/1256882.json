            "background": "Under the current system, those individuals  wishing to work, but require childcare, may find themselves in a position where their individual income is less than or equivalent to their childcare costs. In this case working is not a financially viable option. They will not qualify for financial help if their partner earns more the the earnings limit for the childcare element. Whilst childcare vouchers and similar schemes are available, their contribution is minimal. As a result skilled workers, including keyworkers, who have valuable skills to offer society are unable to work even if they want to.",
