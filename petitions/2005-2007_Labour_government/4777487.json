We deem some of these charges may be illegal and also may infringe on our civil liberties as overburden taxpayers.",

            "background": "We feel it is wrong in some instances to charge people for using there own cameras to photograph records, to sign copyright declaration forms where there is no copyright and to pay local authorities to find where a past relative are buried. We feel local authorities are using a growing hobby like family history as a way of raising revenue. We also feel that in this growing age of the internet, national & local government should make these records available via local authority websites. They could work with family history organisation who would be more than willing to help out free of charge.",
