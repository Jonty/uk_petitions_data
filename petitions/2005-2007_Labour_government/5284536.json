            "background": "The NHS is billions of pounds in debt in which it will never recover. As more people are having operations and the costs for operations etc rising and teh waiting lists getting longer. This country should adopt the private health care scheme like America all we need is Healthcare insurance. This way there might even be a reduction in Taxes as no longer paying more to pay off thes NHS. The private hospitals are cleaner and people are well looked after due to staff on higher pay packets. Therfore i ask you all for the better of this nation to sign this petition and receive better healthcare.",
