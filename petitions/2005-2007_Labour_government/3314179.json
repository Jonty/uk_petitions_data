            "background": "The middle lane on a motorway is for overtaking - NOT for sitting in. Motorway driving should be included in driving tests, but most of us already are holders of full licences. How will we know that there is motorway etiquette?\n\nThis petition is not for the inclusion of fines nor penalties. We do not want to campaign for driving test changes either. We want to tell middle-lane cruisers that they create chaos.\n\nA TV & Radio campaign will quickly get the message to them and would be much cheaper and less hassle than modifying every motorway in the UK to accommodate the needs of middle-lane drivers.\n\nOur motorways literally become dual carriageways. The environment & our pockets suffer, our travel time gets disrupted and road rage increases. Not to mention the huge amount of taxpayers\u2019 money that gets spent on improving motorways.\n\nPlans exist to make the M25 wider, as well as other motorways. There is no need to add a lane on a motorway, it already exists... it is called lane 1.",
