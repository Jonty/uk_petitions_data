            "background": "The Department of Work and Pensions are planing to close twenty six rural jobcentres across five English counties, many of which are based in rural areas, and will lead to people facing unacceptable distances of travel to get help back into work. \n\nOffice closures and job cuts have already led to people finding it more difficult and having to travel further to get help back into work. The closure of these offices will undoubtedly lead to people wanting to get back into work having to travel unacceptable distances to get help. With hundreds of jobcentres and benefits offices already closed in urban areas, the fear is that this first wave of consultations marks the beginning of a wider closure programme of jobcentres in rural communities. The government are in danger of turning their back on rural communities in the race to cut costs and slash jobs. The government needs to recognise that importance of the roll these jobcentres play in getting people back into to work and halt their closure",
