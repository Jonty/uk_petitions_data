            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Several years ago the european court permitted the establishment of tied houses on the basis that the pub tenant would be no worse off than if he/she were free of tie. Over the years since this ruling it has been a major topic of debate in the industry and most tenants believe that they are being totally exploited by pubco's who negotiate massive discounts with brewers but pass little or none onto their tenanted houses. The tenants knows he/she can buy beer themselves at greatly reduced prices and are left to compete in an unfair manner against both managed and freehouses. Pubs at the centre of our communities have closed unneccessarily as a result of this practice and the communities involved are loosing valuable centres for organising sport and charity events. Many tenants have lost their livelyhood, been plunged into debt or bankruptcy while the pubco's and their investors have raked in massive profits. Its wrong and this practice must be stopped now before more damage is done to community pubs.",
