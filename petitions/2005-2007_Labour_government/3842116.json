        "background": "Dear all,\nI am writing regarding the fiasco that is the recent doctors selection process for future training. This has been an unmitigated disaster with regard to selection. Some doctors despite not qualifying under the person spec have been selected for interview. Excellent doctors who despite meeting all qualifying criteria and gaining outstanding references have been overlooked.\nI call for the application process to be audited so that those responsible for these errors are disciplined.\nThe selection process needs to be run again from the beginning and be transparent to avoid the accusations of incompetence, cost cutting and opacity, it needs to be done NOW so that we actually have decent, junior doctors in place when posts are to be filled in August. We cannot allow the present shortlisted applicants to continue with the procedure for fear of losing a large proportion of the most talented doctors in the country.",
