            "background": "Instead of paying huge subsidies to the Bus companies who complain their Buses cannot run on time due to congestion in Our Cities I suggest that Condutors are put back onto the Buses  especially at the peak times.This would mean that a Bus full of passengers do not have to sit and wait while the Driver takes the fares from the queue and the Bus can then drive on much more quickly.Traffic waiting behind the stopped Bus would move much sooner.This would also reduce the need for Bus Lanes aswell..",
