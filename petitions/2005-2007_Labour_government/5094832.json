            "background": "The low fares airline Ryanair is a disgrace to the aviation industry. They do not train thier cabin crew to a suitable standard. They make their crew work extremly long hours. They penalise disabled and blind passengers. They do not have thier aircraft always up to CAA (or european equivalent) maintenance standards. They once falsified airport clearance documents. For anyone who does not believe this Channel 4 aired a dispatches programme on the whole issue. The best thing to do is to stop this airline form operating from any U.K airport till they clean up their act. \nThe undersigned",
