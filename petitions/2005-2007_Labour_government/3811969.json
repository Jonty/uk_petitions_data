This is old, sexist and out of date and the law needs changing NOW.\nWhy are mothers naturally assumed as the ideal parent when most unmarried mothers use the children as bargaining tools with local authorities and the father.\nWe should not let children be used as weapons by selfish single minded mothers.\nGive Fathers Rights... NOW.\nPlease sign up and change the future of our children for the better.",
