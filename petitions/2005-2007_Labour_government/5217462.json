I also do not wish to be forced into a ridiculous 6x + mortgage, on an average wage, just to be able to get on the property ladder.\n\nWould the government please scrap or, at the very least, increase the Stamp Duty threshold; build decent, affordable housing which is banned from Buy-to-Let investors and build enough of these types of accommodation in order to help meet today's demand.",
