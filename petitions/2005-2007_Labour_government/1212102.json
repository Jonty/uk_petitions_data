Further, to include a question on every school inspection about how they have involved parents in the choice and delivery of the programmes and how, in other ways, they support families.",

        "background": "The care of our children is the most important thing we do in our society. As a parent I know just how difficult that can be. Parents need support not condemnation. All parents should have easy access to reliable programmes that will offer them an opportunity to meet others and think about improving their relationships with their children. Parenting programmes can do  that: a weekly short video and chat on the topic in a relaxed and informal way over coffee and biscuits. The bad publicity parents now get does not encourage parents to seek help when they need it. Support this petition to help reduce the stigma of parenting programmes and to help parents improve relationships in their own homes. Then, our children will stand a much better chance of growing up capable of reaching their full potential as well rounded human beings who contribute positively to their community and environment.\nIs anything more important?\n(\u00a3200 per school or clinic would do)",
