        "background": "I propose that the Government should raise the age limit from 16 to 18 to stop school kids riding scooters and causing a menace on roads, and this goes for quad bikes too,\nAnd also raise the restriction of CC size on motorbikes that a full car license holder has\nTo 125cc what good is a 49cc moped on the hills we have, many people have got full driving licenses, it too much trouble to put in for a new test to ride bigger bikes and I would ride a big scooter in summer to save fuel and we can all have a lot of fun at the same time",
