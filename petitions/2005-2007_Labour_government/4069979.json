        "background": "We petition the Prime Minister, to not penalise the owners of older 4x4 vehicles due to their emissions.\n\nAt the time of manufacture, such vehicles were within standards of required emissions.\n\nIt is not the owners fault that legislation changes and the vehicle they own now has a higher emission standard to that required by current or future legislation.\n\nMany cannot afford to change their vehicles and are therefore being descriminated against financially for something they own and cannot replace.\n\nTherefore it would be fairer to introduce a vehicle registration age  limitation, such as was introduced when the seatbelt legislation was introduced. This would be fairer to individuals who currently own such older vehicles.",
