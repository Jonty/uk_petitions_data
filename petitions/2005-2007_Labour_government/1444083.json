        "background": "The Television Licence Fee, which British citizens are forced to pay by law, is unjust and unfair. Every year people are imprisoned and fined on the strength of this archaic law. These people are mostly the poor and disadvantaged in our society. It is a matter of shame that this sort of thing still goes on in the 21st century in what is supposed to be a civilised and democratic country.",
