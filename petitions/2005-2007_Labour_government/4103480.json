            "background": "Plans for an outright ban on traditional incandescent light bulbs are unacceptable. Such bulbs are brighter, faster to achieve full output, and operate with dimmer switches. In addition many existing fittings are too small for low energy bulbs. Rather than yet another silly ban, the use of low energy bulbs and new LED lighting should be encouraged by the scrapping of VAT on such items.",
