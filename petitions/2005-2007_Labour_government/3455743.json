THIS FORCE AS THEY ARE, IN WHOLE, MAKE LIFE CHANGHING DECISIONS MOST MINUTES OF THE DAY. THIS SHOULD NOT BE LOOKED UPON AS ROUTINE (AS IT IS ) EVERYTHING AT PRESENT IS ALL GONE \"TOPSEY TURVEY\" AND IS, AT MOST TIMES  UNACCEPTABLE! LOGIC HAS GONE OUT OF THE WINDOW! TO ME IT'S ALL PRESSURE,BUT THAT'S ANOTHER STORY! I DO FEEL BECAUSE OF THE POWER THESE PEOPLE POCESS THEY SHOULD BE SCRUTINISED  ACCORDINGLY. I THEREFORE PETITION THE PM TO FORWARD LEGISLATION THAT ALL POLICE OFFICER'S SHOULD BE CERTIFIED (FIT FOR DUTY ) EACH AND EVERY SHIFT THEY BEGIN! ie BREATHALIZER TEST AND ILLEGAL SUBSTANCES TEST.
