            "background": "How often do you drive by a coned off area on the road/motorway when nobody is working? This is the case at 9am, 1pm, 6pm, 8pm and even 2am! Are cones put down to slow down the traffic and raise money through speed cameras or are they actually there to cordon off the road and allow workmen space to do their work? If so, why are these guys never working? In fact, in 13 years of driving I have only seen about 2 workmen in these coned off areas. If they are not working, then remove the cones and allow the traffic to pass.",
