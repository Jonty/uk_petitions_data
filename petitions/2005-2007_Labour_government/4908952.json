In that case they are likely to be accused of being apathetic to the election, which may be far from the truth.  They may very intensely care about the election, but simply cannot bring themselves to support the candidates put forward.\n\nAlternatively, they could attend the election, and spoil their ballot paper.  In that case, they are likely to be classed as simply too incompetent to properly fill in the ballot paper.  This too may be wholly untrue, and insulting, when in fact all they are trying to do is express an option that was not allowed them, that they actively choose none of the candidates before them.",
