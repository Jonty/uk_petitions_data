            "background": "Passengers, at the moment, have no right to redress the problem of the inconvenience caused by late-running trains, for example. A reduction in fare, such as 10p for every minute the train was delayed, would be a much fairer way of treating passengers and most likely reduce a lot of the stress and abuse received by train staff. If the trains run on time no-one loses out.",
