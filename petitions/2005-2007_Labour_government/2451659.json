            "background": "Its been a long time since The Beatles did anything good, and The Flaming Stars consisting of band members\n\nJoe Whitney - drums\nHuck Whitney - guitar\nMax D\u00e9charn\u00e9 - vocals, keyboards\nMark Hosking - guitar\nPaul Dempsey - bass guitar\n\nhave been until now, critically and horrifically underrated by the music industry. Spitefully ignored by the majority of their peers, their influence is unmeasurable to those in \"the know\". Consistently brilliant releases, rare live performances of fantastic quality, all unuttered amongst the nations cultural consciousness. With the Dreadfully unrevered Max Decharne dipping into the literary world to preserve 1950's hipster slang with the publication of a dictionary of terms, means this band as a cultural icon needs to be acknowledged by awarding them MBE's.",
