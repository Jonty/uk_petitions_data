        "action": "Put the onus on Local authorities to demonstrate that there is NO housing need in a village where any registered social landlord proposes to build affordable housing instead of forcing the RSL to carry out expensive surveys which invariably show that such need exists",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present most local planning authorities have policies (called \"exceptions policies\") which allow affordable housing to be build following a Housing Needs Survey. Such Surveys invariably demonstrate that such need exists but they are expensive and time consuming. Due to the total lack of evidence that there is NO housing need in Britain's Rural Communities it is time that the onus of proof of need was reversed and Local planning authorities were required to produce evidence of a lack of housing need in local villages if they wish to refuse permission for affordable housing developments. \nThe Housing Corporation nowadays allows RSLs to be more risk -taking, if they built homes there was no demand for they would suffer finanicially,( empty homes attract no rental income) however, it is most unlikely this would happen, the most probable result would be more rapid provision of affordable homes for people in rural areas, which is currently held up by planners.",
