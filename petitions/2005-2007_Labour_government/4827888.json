        "background": "Jason Porter attends school. He has been told by Mrs Guest, our head of upper school, that he needs to have his hair cut. This is a clear breach of Jason's human rights, the right to freedom of expression. Please help us to allow his hair to grow back. Since his hair cut, Jason has become a changed man. Instead of being a lively individual, he is enclosed, quiet, and upset. Vote against this atrocity!!!",
