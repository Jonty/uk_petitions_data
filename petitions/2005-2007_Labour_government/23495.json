Stopping people smoking in work places is a half-measure, smokers can still smoke themselves to death outside pubs and workplaces, and of course in their homes.  i wish i did not smoke, and i'm sure i am not the only smoker who wishes that tobacco products were rendered unavailable - it may be the only way for some of us to stop.",
