            "background": "The amount of stopping areas on the (for example) M20 are now in short supply, and many truck drivers are forced to a) park illegally in Supermarkets, double yellow lines...etc b) carry on driving whether or not they are out of driving hours and c) park unsafely next to roads when they are carrying fragile goods. Truck crime is now at an all time high, and thefts are occuring nightly from trailers. If the drivers had somewhere safe to park, with razor wire, regular security patrols and CCTV cameras, many drivers would not loose their loads to organised crinimal gangs that specifically target them.",
