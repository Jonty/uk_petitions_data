They are on the pharmacy shelves, but the only people who can have them are people who pay for themselvesor are on clinical trials. (not everyone can take part in clinical trials) the drugs are available in most European countries and the US.BY THE POWER OF LOBBYING I HOPE TO CHANGE THE SITUATION JUST AS BREAST CANCER PATIENTS CHANGED THE LAW ON THE DRUG HERCEPTIN.MY HUSBAND IS ONLY 44 YEARS OLD AND HE DESPERATLEY NEEDS THE TREATMENT TO PROLONG HIS LIFE.THE UK IS AT THE BACK OF THE QUEUE WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING NEW DRUGS. IT'S ALL ABOUT COST!!!! AND NOT THE RIGHT TO PROLONG LIFE AND GIVE A BETTER QUALITY OF LIFE TO BOWEL CANCER PATIENTS.",
