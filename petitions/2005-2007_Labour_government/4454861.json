However, this time, it is coming in by the back door.  Nobody is getting a say in this matter, and, despite many of the District Councils being against this merger, the plans are going full steam ahead.\n\nIt is absolutely ridiculous that the people whom this will effect are not getting any say whatsoever.  In order to justify this country naming itself 'democratic' a referendum must be granted.  If the people vote to abolish their district councils, in favour a unitary council, then so be it.  But until then, such a move ignores the rights of the voter to determine who they owe their obligation to.",
