            "background": "I believe that the government should NOT consider giving people paid time off work to attend quit smoking clinics. I have recently quit smoking by simply reading Allen Carrs easy way to stop smoking book, and believe that all smokers would actually stop smoking if only they read this book.\nI think if the government gave people paid time off work to attend clinics people would misuse the system, just to get paid time off work.\nIts actually easy for any smoker to stop, if only they all read this book.\nI don't see why we the taxpayer should pay for people to attend these clinics, when all these people have to do is spend \u00a38.99 of their money on the said book, which would make them quit smoking forever!",
