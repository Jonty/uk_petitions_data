I feel it is unfair that a change of leadership and direction of the labor party should be allowed without a genral election as the new Prime Minister has different veiws on matters than the previous Prime minister. If the Labor party feels so strongly about there new leader is right for the public then surly the public would vote is his favor but as it is the public will not have a choice on who will next run the contry on their behalf.",
