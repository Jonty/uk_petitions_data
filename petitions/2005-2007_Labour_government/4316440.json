            "background": "The carbon emissions of fossil fuels is well documented as is the increase in emissions from more powerful cars that use high speed.  The carbon footprint is increased by vehicles using high engine revs (as in local pursuits in urban areas).\n\nTherefore to reduce carbon emissions and contribute to a reduction in global warming, we call upon the Government to enact legislation whereby police motor vehicles be limited to the prevailing speed limits.  Where, in the judgement of a Senior Police Officer there is a need to exceed the prevailing speed limit, a written consent must be given to the police vehicle, the subject of that consent, and that form of consent must be carried in the relevant police vehicle.  In order to gain a form of consent, the driver of the police vehicle must make application (in triplicate) and file that with the Senior Police Officer (aforesaid) a minimum of two days before such consent is required.",
