        "action": "Make Public Transport fuel tax free and scrap the Road Tax",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Taxing vehicle owners merely for possessing a vehicle encourages greater use of private transport. Because we have the overhead of road tax (and insurance), the cost of each journey is less that it would be if we had to pay the tax through use of the vehicle.  By scrapping road tax and increasing fuel duty, car owners are more likely to leave their car in the drive and take the bus or train because the economics would be turned it the favour of public transport.  The current system allows owners to tax their vehicle, even if their insurance and MOT is about to run out.  An MOT and Insurance tax disc system could be introduced, which would prove all year round that the vehicle is safe and insured.  The economic case for public transport use could be assisted by not taxing fuel used in public transport or by refunding the tax.  This would also help the train and bus better compete with short hall air travel, as aircraft fuel is not taxed, which provides airlines with an unfair advantage.",
