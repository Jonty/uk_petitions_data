            "background": "The most common and easiest recycled items are glass, paper and tins and cans. yet most councils will collect only one or two of these items. this means taht those who wish to recycle all they can are forced to go about it alone. By making the collection of these items compulosry we make it easier for those to recycle, thus encouraging the habit, and we become much closer to reaching recycling targets.",
