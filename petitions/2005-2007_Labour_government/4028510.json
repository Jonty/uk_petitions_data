            "background": "Why should workers who use the buses to travel to and from work,and pay for the 'priveledge' have to endure noisy,rude and obnoxious rabbles of school children in the mornings who ride for free and often jump onto the bus via the back doors,thus filling the bus up and leaving paying customers on the pavement?Drivers do nothing about this as they are probably scared and if anything is said by other passengers it is met with a torrent of foul mouthed abuse.\n\nLet kids travel free but give them their own buses!!!!",
