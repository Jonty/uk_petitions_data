        "background": "If the government made it law, as in the USA and other countries, that everyone had to have medical insurance for all medical treatment based on a means test system, which would take into account the elderly and those poeple living on the poverty line, this would ease the pressure on our failing NHS system, it would generate more cash for hospitals which in turn would mean that everyone would benefit from an improved health service. The system could be regulated by an independant governing body to ensure that no one was taken advantage of by insurance companies or any medical professionals.",
