        "background": "Wheelchair users wishing to get on / off a train must wait for station staff to get a ramp. This is dangerous and unfair as if you are being bothered by somebody or there is any kind of problem, you can not get off at any earlier station. It is also a fire hazard to not be able to leave the train. I call upon the PM to put himself in my position for a week and then force all trains to have built-in ramps as new buses do. In this age of dreaded political correctness, it is amazing that disabled people do not get the same consideration as other minorities do.",
