        "background": "The road lobby has consistently argued that speed is not the major factor in the carnage on our roads.  This experiment of reducing speeds (60 on M-ways, 40 dual carriageway and 30 on single track) will establish the truth. If there is no reduction in road deaths we simply revert to the previous limits.  If, on the other hand, road deaths decrease we keep the reduced limits.",
