            "background": "Our rail network is in such a mess that haulage companies are still having to transport haulage on our roads instead of rail, including Royal mail moving to road instead of rail a few years ago, this has caused thousands of extra vehicles per day, \nLarge haulage companies who are now competing against royal mail are also just using road when if the investment was put into working on rail instead of administration & stealth taxing ideas then rail could be put forward as an option,\nThere are a lot of rail links through the country already & there is technology in the truck trailers to switch from road to rail with ease,\n\nThe government needs to look at the cost saving to industry, which will put funds back into the rail network, \nNot just think of the funds from fuel tax",
