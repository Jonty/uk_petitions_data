            "background": "At present, a householder wishing to carry out certain modifications to his or her home (e.g. replacing a window or fitting an electric shower) is in many cases required to obtain building regulations approval. Although there are safety issues with some work, surely this is solely the responsibility of the householder, after all, with the possible exeption of Gas work, which is covered by seperate regulations anyway, dodgy DIY is unlikely to affect anyone outside of the house concerned. The safety of future occupiers should be assured by instead \"tweaking\" the survey process to include safety checks when the house changes hands, rather than restrictions on what the owner can do whilst he lives there. I propose that building regulations be relaxed, so that they apply to work carried out \"in the normal course of a businesss\" (in line with other consumer protection law), and to larger projects that would also require planning permission only.",
