            "background": "Too many children are missing out on their education due to the hastiness of head teachers using exclusions as a first rather than last resort. My son alone has missed out on most of his basic primary education for the above reasons, he now has a diagnosis of ADHD and is managed by medication but exclusions have hindered his progress with literacy and numeracy. \nThe bottom line is that children are entitled to education, if we as parents keep our children off school we are prosecuted so why should headteachers have the right to exclude on a whim. Children as young a 5 are excluded on a regular basis from my childrens former school - this learns them that if they do not want to attend school they can simply play up and get sent home.\n\nThis practise must stop as soon as possible. Every child matters.",
