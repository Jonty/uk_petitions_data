            "background": "Having children is entirely optional so there is no reason why anyone should choose to have a baby they are unable to support.\n\nWe ask the government to stop paying benefits and tax credits to parents and making all the responsible people who choose not to have children support all those who have them regardless of thier own ability to support the child.\n\nMany of this countries problems would go away if people were more responsible about thier children (anti-social behaviour to name but one). So we ask you to make the parents think before producing babies they know they cannot afford. \n\nIf they are so irresponsible to have children when they cannot afford them, then why should the rest of us pay them to keep on doing it.",
