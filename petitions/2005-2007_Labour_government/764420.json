The type of fluoride used has been classified as a \"Part II poison\" - even the instructions on tubes of toothpaste warn against using too much. Proponents of Fluoridation argue that it may be good for your teeth, but if Fluoride has any beneficial effect on the body at all, then logically it must be a \"medicine\".
