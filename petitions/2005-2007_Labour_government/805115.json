            "background": "Government targets to build so called affordable housing in Essex and other parts of the South East of England are unsustainable.  Infrastructure such as sewerage systems and water supplies are being stretched as it is.  Roads are becoming more and more congested.  Houses and flats are being built on known flood areas creating more pressures on a fragile eco-system.  There needs to be more consultation and power given to people living in locations that have been chosen for expansion of housing or commercial building, those who reside in these areas have a better knowledge of how transport and environment work around them.   Please stop putting pressure on this part of the country.  We already have expansion due to the 2012 Olympics \u2013 that is enough.",
