            "background": "Over the years due to higher demand of live performances (eBay prices etc), all agents have set their booking fees higher and higher. Consumers are paying up to 30% or more of face value on tickets. This needs to be regulated in a smart way. \n\nIf done wrong it will merely make booking agents charge more on P&P instead. It also appears that there is anti-competitive price fixing on these fees as all agents charge the same levels, which periodically have lifted over the years.",
