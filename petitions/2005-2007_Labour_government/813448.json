        "background": "You can ride a horse on UK roads at almost any age without insurance. You needn't have passed any test, wear a helmet, or even pay road tax. The chances of a young rider stopping a frightened horse are minimal in the least! It is about time a minimum age was introduced, along with a mendatory  riding license with insurance.",
