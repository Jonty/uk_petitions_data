It could be that my ex-husband is a commissioned Officer and also Aircrew, but this should make no difference.  They are well paid, on a regular basis and are unlikely to be made redundant.  They, as a collective, are the most able to pay and therefore, should be 'encouraged' by the Armed Forces to do so.",
