            "background": "There are many surveys that show that the electorate feels disengaged from the political process.  Politicians generally hide behind the term \u201cparliamentary democracy\u201d as thought they know best and can therefore ignore public opinion.  The electorate is now better education and more informed than when this term was created.  Giving these petitions some real authority will enable the electorate to make a meaningful contribution to legislation.  A petition signature count of 2 million of the electorate is sufficient to demonstrate the seriousness of the issue and likely to deter special interest groups.",
