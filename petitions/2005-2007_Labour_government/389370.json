The person , who now pays a monthly fee to see a  Dentist, the person who can't afford to watch a football match, even though they work 6 days a week), the person who will have to work till they die, because I have to pay the pension of someone who has just arrived here  The person who will shortly not be able to afford to have there own vehicle and have to ride on piss poor public transport,where we might get stabbed by someone who should have been looked after by a decent health service.   No decent pension and out of my gross of \u00a32200 (with 32 hrs overtime) you take \u00a3600. However you still expect me to contribute to my own pension Explain, when my youngest son goes to Afghanistan/Iraq later this year?.  Every single person I have spoken to in the last 12 months, thinks this country is beyond repair!",
