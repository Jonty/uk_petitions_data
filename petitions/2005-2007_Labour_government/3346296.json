        "background": "It is now nearly 2 years since London was awarded the 2012 Olympics. Whilst we hear much about budgets - what is happening with the \u00a3600 million going into our sporting talent? Distribution of funds at grass roots level in sport is diabolical - no amount of \"spin\" can counter this fact. For sure schools have schemes - but its when a kid has progrssed from entry level into performance level the problems arise - espcially if its a technical sport requiring technical coaching. As a parent of talented kids its a crime that there talent may not reach its potential because of lack of funding. We have to get into the hearts and minds of schools and parents NOW to ensure our kids are ready for 2012. This petition is for all parents with sporting kids to sign-up so that we can help our children have a chance of winning GOLD ...  not silver, not bronze - we must develop a winning culture and that starts now with the signing of this petition.",
