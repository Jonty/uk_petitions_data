            "background": "We agree with the PM that \"something needs to be done\" about traffic congestion and pollution from cars. HOWEVER we urge the PM NOT to introduce charges in the major urban areas outside London without HUGE INVESTMENT in urban rail transport; in particular we request that all the recently proposed light rail systems (MerseyTram, Bristol, West Yorks, South Hants plus FULL expansion of Manchester Metrolink, Midland Metro and Nottingham NET) need fast-tracking and even underground lines (or tram tunnels) should be built in Greater Manchester, West Midlands and maybe other large cities too. This would bring us in to line with other European city regions and encourage car owners to make more use of good public transport inside urban areas. Then congestion charges would be fairer for all and pollution would be cut.",
