            "background": "The basis of our criminal law system, is old archaic pieces of legislation that don't fulfil their purpose anymore.  One of the most used pieces of legislation, the Offences Against the Person Act- was enacted in 1861.  The Law Commission has made countless recommendations for reform, yet the Government has reformed very few pieces of existing criminal law.  It seems that there has been too much focus on creating new offences.  With an active programme of reform of criminal law legislation, there will be more cohesion between different offences, and they will meet the needs of today's society for law and order.",
