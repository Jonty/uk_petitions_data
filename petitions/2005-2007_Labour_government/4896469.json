        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently tailgating is one of the greatest causes of accidents on our roads, yet in this country it is not a specific offence. \n\nExcluding those who speed in built-up areas where the speed limit is there for the benefit of pedestrians not motorists, not all speeding motorists are guilty of bad driving.\n\nDriving at 80 mph on an empty motorway is hardly a danger to anyone, whereas driving at 40 mph or 50 mph tailgating the vehicle in front on any road is.  This of course is exacerbated at much higher speeds on dual carriageways and motorways.  All to often the reason for an accident is put down to speed when tailgating was the real cause.  Rarely does speed alone cause an accident.\n\nWe therefore call on the government to bring in legislation to outlaw tailgating, and to instruct the police to be more active in prosecuting offending drivers.",
