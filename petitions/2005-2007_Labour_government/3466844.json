            "background": "1 in 4 people will suffer a mental health illness in there life, many of these illnesses can be identified at a very early stage if only the appropriate primary care sector where tooled up to recognise and cater for them, too many people are just medicalised and hospitalised unnecacarily, there is no attempt to use person centerd methods or alternative psychotherapies or psychologies.\nThey are stigmatised and the state seems to forget about them it is time for the 1 in 4 to stand up and be counted and demand BETTER mental health care in the community and hospital, this requires a fundamental change in attitude of NHS staff (not all) and goverment to people with a mental health condition",
