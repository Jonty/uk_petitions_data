            "background": "More than 10% of the people living in my area are on the housing waiting list. I do not demand more public money be thrown at this massive problem.\nMore affordable homes may be built for local young people to live in without more public subsidy.\nGovernment currently restricts exception site developments (small numbers of properties outside but near to the planning envelope) to 100% affordable homes.\nThis policy seems to deliver more affordable properties than would a mixed tenure development. \nIn practice this policy rarely delivers mainly because it is not attractive to landowners.  Substantial public subsidies are also needed to fund the development.\nException sites should be permitted to provide 50% open market and 50% affordable homes. More attractive to the landowner, this would deliver \"balanced communities\" and could be achieved with minimal public subsidy. The open market homes subsidise the affordable properties.  This modified policy would deliver many more affordable homes.",
