        "background": "If an two Individuals, sharing a house, each submits a successful claim for Income Support, they are granted a maximum amount of \u00a357.45. If a couple do the same, they are granted the equivalent of \u00a345.05. This disparity does not apply to two private individuals sharing a house; only to those who \"share a bed\", as a couple. I believe this to be discrimination, based on nothing more than participation of a relationship.",
