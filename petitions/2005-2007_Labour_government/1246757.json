            "background": "In 1549 Cornwall rose against the Reformation and the imposition of the Church of England and its new prayer book - a change from the ways of the Roman Catholic church to those of Protestantism.\n\nThe Prayer Book Rebellion was a refusal to have English read in church. Cornwall existed with three languages - Latin in church, Cornish outside church and English when you were talking to visitors from up country.\n\nSo in 1549 they crossed the Tamar, beseiging Exeter and fighting a series of Britains most bloody battles with the King's forces in England.\n\nIn one instance, 900 unarmed bound and gagged Cornish soldiers were slaughtered in just ten minutes by the troops of Edward VI.\n\nIn another instance around a thousand surrounded rebels were burned alive when the English set fire to the village of Clyst St Mary.\n\nThe surviving few were driven back into Cornwall where thousands were hanged or otherwise slaughtered.\n\nIt is estimated that 11% of the population of Cornwall was slaughtered.",
