            "background": "Faith schools have long made a great contribution to British education and few practice indoctrination or are sectarian. They also give much needed variety to education. \nHowever the teaching of \"Creationism\" i.e. Young Earth Creationism (earth only 10000yrs old) and Intelligent Design must have no place in science teaching as they are scientifically worthless and run counter to the last 2000 years of science. To teach them would further weaken the scientific base of our nation.",
