            "background": "Over recent years numerous cases have arisen where pension funds and individual savings have been decimated by poor advice and management by so called experts, however despite these problems these so called experts have taken large commissions and/or fees, which cannot be correct. The Government should introduce legislation to stop such practices and only allow such payments for success as public confidence in pensions and savings has been destroyed whilst a minority have gained significant wealth.",
