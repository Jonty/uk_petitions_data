            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently parents receiving DLA for their disabled children have the benefit suspended whilst their children are admitted to hospital for longer or frequent stays. Hospital stays are very costly for parents/carers as transport, childcare costs & living expenses increase not decrease when a child is admitted. The financial burden increases significantly because parents are required to maintain a home, which is usually being lived in by the other carer, who may have siblings to care for too, in addition to the expense of living temporarily on a hospital ward. Parents/carers may also have to give up work or take unpaid leave for the period their child is in hospital. The loss of this benefit creates additional and unnecessary additional pressure for families under extreme stress",
