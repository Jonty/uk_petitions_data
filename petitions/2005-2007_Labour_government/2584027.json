We have all been branded GUILTY untill proven innocent by HMRC due to there incompetence in actually cathing the fraudsters. We all abide by HMRC's rules and regulations but this still is not enough.I feel that HMRC's tactics are to just hold everyone's vat reclaim and hope that the companies go out of business of which many are. Legal battles with HMRC are costing into the \u00a3100,000 mark of which many traders can not afford but are left with little option and this is not acceptable. SOMTHING NEEDS TO BE DONE NOW !!!!",
