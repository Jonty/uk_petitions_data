            "background": "Tobacco companies used false advertising to promote cigarettes until the 1980s, damaging the health of smokers and others, until it was banned.\n\nWhy should this be any different for car manufacturers? Everyday we are 'seduced' by images of the car as an object of desire, being at one with nature as a healthy 'lifestyle' option, when the reality is that cars are damaging the health of us and our children through carbon emissions, destroying the environment through global warming and creating an antisocial nuisance by cluttering our streets with their ugliness, creating noise, and menacing more socially conscious users of the UK's roads.\n\nIf the reality of car usage on the streets was portrayed in advertising in the same way it is now done with smoking, our nation's health would be better, our environment would be better, and there would be less congestion. \n\nI urge the government to restrict this kind of false advertising and malpractice by car manufacturers",
