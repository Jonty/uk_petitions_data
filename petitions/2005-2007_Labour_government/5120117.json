        "background": "The Home Office would apparently like police to have greater freedom to stop and question anyone in the UK. This is a threat to our civil liberties.\n\nIt has also been reported, by the BBC, that the Prime Minister believes that to put civil liberties before fighting terror is \"misguided and wrong\". \n\nIf we allow him to surrender our liberties because of terror, we will have surrendered them to terror.\n\nPlease, if you care for your civil rights, forward this e-petition to like-minded friends, and ensure that no law-abiding person in Britain has reason to fear the knock on the door or the tap on the shoulder. The Government may have misrepresented its aim - if that is the case, the Prime Minister should say so.",
