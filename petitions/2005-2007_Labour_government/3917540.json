            "background": "Government scientists have recognised that susceptible people have adverse health reactions to certain additives i.e. Sodium Metabisulphite E223 is known to trigger severe asthmatic reactions in some people, Aspartame E951 is known to be a danger to people suffering a certain genetic condition - Phenylketonuria. No one seems to know exactly what this situation is. The public surely at least deserve warnings on products containing the 60 or so additives known or suspected of carrying side effects? Consequently there is an urgent need for a full and independent scientific analysis to be carried out.",
