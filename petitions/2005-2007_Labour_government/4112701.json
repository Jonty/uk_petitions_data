            "background": "Average levels of insulation in the UK are approximately 3.5 times worst than equivalent housing in Germany.  Owners of older, poorly insulated housing stock who wish to sell their property should be required to ensure that the property meets a minimum level of insulation (e.g. average U-value).  The requirements for insulation would rise over time.  This would ensure that insulation levels of Uk housing stock was progressively improved.",
