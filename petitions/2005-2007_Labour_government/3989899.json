            "background": "Zimbabwe has had trouble for a long time. However, at this moment in time, it has the potential to become a larger warzone with the arrest and abuse of opposition party members.\nIn the case that it does escalate to this level, the UN and other organisations may be required to intervene. Why not intervene now in negotiating with fair terms, not about payment for land (non-existant money) etc., but how to get the country off the ground and the rest can come in due course.\nA strategy to give the people the knowledge and skill on how to use the land for cash crops by using those who have this knowledge, may be one way to start. However, it must be done on the condition that international monitors are allowed to keep track of the economics and finances and on the program to ensure farmers are learning and using the land for the purpose intended.\nChange of government will not take place for a long time. Until then, the people still need to live.\nPrevent more blood spill than try to clean it up.",
