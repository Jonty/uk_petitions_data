            "background": "council tax has reached an unsustainable level and is an extremely unfair tax. It is actually worse than income tax and it should be based on ability to pay from income as opposed to the value of the property. Sending round officials to revalue properties is an invasion of privacy. It is also a triple tax as the money earned is subject to income tax, out of one's income one then buys/pays for improvements where VAT is charged. Now the government want to charge for a third time and penalise anyone who does not fritter money away but instead spends it on their home.",
