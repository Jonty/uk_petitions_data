        "background": "I recently heard that, although many people have petitioned against the issue surrounding road taxes, the Government will still carry out this law, whether we, the people of Britain agree with it or not.\nBut surely, because we voted the labour party into power, then they should listen to us, and at least take what we have said into more consideration.\nI am starting this petition to raise my concerns to the Government, to seriously think about whether or not they are on our, and by our I mean the citizens of Britain, sides.\nThank you for your time",
