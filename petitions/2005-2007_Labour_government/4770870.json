            "background": "we the undersigned object that: proposal HP3 This proposed link road has the potential to erode the greenbelt, lead to coalesence, compromise the setting of historic monuments, result in various environmental impacts, erode the identity of local communities, compromise precautionary principles, affect biodiversity, include land at risk from flooding, introduce industrial uses into a suburban/rural setting, increase pressure on existing high streets and increase traffic on the customs Rbt/ Stevensons Bridge/ Cornton road/ Causewayhead road corridors. An ideal alternative expansion area is available in East Stirling and consideration should be given to this.\nProposal TRP1 (4) - is unsustainable and will only relieve the above road corridors in the short term, and will have an impact on the \nrivers Forth and Teith and potentially draw hillfoots traffic through Causewayhead.  It will do little to improve the operation of the city center road network and air quality.",
