            "background": "Under the Copyright, Design and Patents Act 1988 the viewing of films in care homes qualifies as 'public performance' and is illegal unless licensed. Care Homes are being bullied into purchasing licenses from agencies representing film studios or face a \u00a35,000 fine.  The only get out is to make care homes exempt from this Act.  These care homes are 'home' to these people and they are being denied the opportunity to view films in their lounge.  Their lounge is deemed as a public place and therefore qualifies the viewing as a public performance.  What other priviledges can we possibly deny our elderly people?  It is just an excuse to cash in on another loophole in legislation. There is a simple solution - create an exemption.  If you are a care home provider, a resident, relative or simply just do not agree with this rediculous act then please sign this petition.",
