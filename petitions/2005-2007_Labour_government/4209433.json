        "background": "I believe that the car tax system should be changed to the actual co emission reading taken when its mot'd. Its all computerised now so they know exactly what cars are causing the high emissions, and it's totally wrong to go purely on the engine size, its also how the driver uses the car. \nI have owned a BMW 318 for that last 4 years and every year it registers <100 on the Co emissions test, and yet I have to pay \u00a3190 because of the engine size! Its wrong, and they know it!",
