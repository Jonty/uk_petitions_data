This encouragement should reduce congestion, ease traffic flow and might even reduce the need to widen existing motorways.   I think we have all been frustrated by being 'held up' by a vehicle travelling at say 60 mph in the outside lane, while the inner lane(s) remain empty !  .... \n\nMOVE TO LEFT HAND LANE  \nAS SOON AS SAFE TO DO SO",
