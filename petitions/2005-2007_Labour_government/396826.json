            "background": "We are petitioning to change the 2002 Commonhold and Leasehold Reform Act which granted the Right to Manage process, to allow this process to operate more smoothly in the real world.  Our request for changes are as follows:\n\n1.  To allow the RTM company to recover the reasonable costs of going through the Right to Manage process from non-members - to end the dilemma where everyone benefits from the process but only some pay for it, within a block of flats.\n\n2.  To allow electronic email and fax service of the documents to prevent the landlord or freeholder denying receipt.\n\n3.  To make the denial of receipt explictly irrelevant, ie. for an explicit statement in the act that service is sufficient.",
