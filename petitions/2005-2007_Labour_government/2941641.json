The best examples are rightly listed to preserve them for future generations - and are now vibrated daily by HGVs. \nThese buildings weren't constructed to withstand the pounding they now receive. That pounding is magnified with speed. \nWe call upon the Government to promote the use of active speed displays in the immediate vicinity of listed buildings.",
