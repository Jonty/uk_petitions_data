This is just not happening.\n\nThe UK has one in five pensioners from a 12 million generation living in poverty, and the UK also has a very high percentage of elderly people's untimely deaths through the winter months and other cold weather spells due to the UK's meagre state pension on-a-par with ever higher utility bills.\n\nMany of our elderly people are going without food to pay their utility bills, in the fourth richest economy in the world.",
