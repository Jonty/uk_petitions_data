        "background": "Currently people can have laser eye surgery on the NHS for cataracts and not much else. Being so short/long sighted that glasses are necessary the entire time is a disability, yet very few people get any NHS support for glasses. Laser eye surgery is much cheaper than buying a pair of glasses every year so to help those of us who are visually impaired the government should give laser eye surgery to people who are eligible for treatment or pay towards glasses for those who cannot have the surgery.",
