            "background": "As the driver of a sensible 4x4, which does regularly venture off road, and is also sometimes used for work, not a chelsea tractor, I think that the view of all 4x4s, championed by among others many government MPs, is unfair to those of us who have a legitimate reason for 4x4 ownership. I ask for an exemption from over the top tax on necessary working vehicles, and for the victimistaion of people for driving a work, or recriational car, just because drive is sent to four wheels instead of two to stop.",
