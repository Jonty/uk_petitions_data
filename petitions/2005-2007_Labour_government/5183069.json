            "background": "There are too many petitions calling for the closing of sweatshops without understanding all the good they do. \n\nIn many developing countries sweatshops provide some of the highest paid unskilled labour jobs (when compared to local pay rates) to some of the world's poorest people. By closing down these sweatshops these people are forced into prositution, have to do jobs that are more dangerous or less well paid, or starve to death. \n\nIn the case of children working in sweatshops their plight is even worse if the sweatshop closes or can no longer employ children because these children are usually orphans and quite often have to support their younger siblings.\n\nSupporting sweatshops helps provide people in developing countries with jobs and the chance to invest in their own country.",
