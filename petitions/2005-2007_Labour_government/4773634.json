            "background": ".. about charging more for people whom actually care about their properties. Why should those of us who look after their gardens, improve them and enjoy them be penalised. If this is introduced, the country will be full of uncared for houses and gardens thus increasing rubbish and vermin. The knock on effect from that will surely affect the NHS as more illness will be incurred through the spead of disease and vermin. Gardens will be left derelict and firms who provide landscaping and garden products will suffer losses. Many gardeners compost what they can and leave very little for the council to collect - they should be rewarded in some way for reducing the Council's overheads, time and resources. Why not enforce a tax on the people who DON'T care for their property - that way we can all enjoy a cleaner, more healthier environment!?",
