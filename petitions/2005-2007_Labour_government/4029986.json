        "action": "Suspend to implement changes to the (red diesel) fuel duty charged for leisure activities such as boating until such time as the EU countries increase their duties on road fuels, alcohol and tobacco etc to British levels.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The loss of the long standing right to use red diesel in vehicles other than those driven on the public roads has been blamed on the EU insistance that there be a 'level playing field' on tax. That being the case, surely it is unjust to impose an increase in tax on the British people whilst the other EU countries enjoy much lower levels of tax on a wide range of products.  Road fuel duty, alcohol and tobacco are the obvious ones that spring to mind and, the latter two in particular, are blamed for vast loads of alcohol and tobacco being imported from the continent to the detriment of our local shops and the frustration of our Customs Officers. Implementation of the duty would cost more than it would raise in tax and take Officers from far more important and cost effective duties. Refuse to implement this unjust ruling until such time as the EU fall in line with us on these much more serious matters.",
