            "background": "Parental leave is not a women's or men's rights issue, but a children's rights issue, even though it affects employment law.\n\nIt is better for a child to be cared for by two people\u2014their mother and her partner\u2014than by the mother alone.  It is unfair to expect women alone to shoulder the bulk of the burden of care for a child conceived by two people.  It is also unfair to deny the mother's partner the chance to spend time with a recently-born child.\n\nThe law should reflect the right of children to proper care, and the responsibility of the mother and her partner to provide that care jointly, by entitling new mother' partners to six months of paid parental leave.\n\nThis should not bankrupt the nation: Sweden manages to pay for a year's maternity leave without ruining its economy; we would be dividing a year's leave between two people.\n\nAs a side effect, this change would also discourage companies who don't want to be inconvenienced by maternity leave from discriminating against women.",
