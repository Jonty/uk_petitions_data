            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition concerns pigs. Pigs are extremely curious and intelligent animals, they are thought by many experts to be at least as intelligent as dogs. Pigs are often farmed in a way which is unjust, being confined to cages sometimes smaller than their own size throughout their hole mature lifetime. \n\nFactory farmed pigs end up going crazy in their cages and can't wait to be taken to be slaughtered. It is heartbreaking to see these animals suffer so un-justifyingly. Closing down all factory farms would not be feasible because many thousands of people would be made redundant and many businesses would go bankrupt. Therefor I put forward the proposal of making it regulation for all factory farmed pigs in the UK to have the space to be able to lay down in their quarters. This will give them a little bit of comfort and make their lives so much more bearable.",
