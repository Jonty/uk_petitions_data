Please protect the public by creating many more prison places to permit longer sentences for serious criminals.  Normal people deserve to feel like they can leave their front doors unlocked and enjoy society in complete safety.  Criminals deserve to feel very scared of losing their freedoms permanently when they abuse their human responsibilities to behave in a civilised manner.",
