        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We ask the Government to consider revising the Housing Subsidy System to allow high performing councils the freedom and flexibility to run their own housing services and make them wholly accountable to tenants. James Strachan Chairman of The Audit Commission said \" We believe Government needs to review how council housing is financed.Rather than trying to substain a complex system of cross-subsidy we recommend that Government should consider allowing those councils that can finance themselves to do that and to focus on how to meet the massive capital demands facing some urban councils which are still failing to meet the needs of their communities.\" 82% of councils do not receive any housing subsidy to help them finance their services but they contribute \u00a3630M of their annual rent income to a central pot which is unfair on their tenants who are on the whole Labour voters. Councils should be allowed to keep ALL their housing revenue for the benefit of their tenants.",
