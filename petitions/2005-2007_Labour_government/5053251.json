            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The WEEE Directive is a noble cause; encouraging recycling of electronic equipment whilst reducing the amount going to landfill.  We all support the principles.  However, the Directive\u2019s UK implementation has created a massively disproportionate cost impact on small local independent computer businesses compared with the massive retailers.  Registration fees alone are up to 10 times more per retail \u00a3 for this sector, whilst the disposal rules cause a 10-25% reduction in price competitiveness.  The irony is that this sector that bears the brunt of the cost is the sector that inherently does most to recycle and prevent waste.  Independent retailers, by their nature, preserve the lifecycle of computers through repairs and servicing, re-using salvageable parts for future repairs to otherwise obsolete equipment and re-working unwanted computers for resale.  Internet retailers and multiples have no equivalent mechanism.  These costs disadvantage could be the final straw that breaks the camel\u2019s back.  ITACS,  their trade association, ask people to sign this petition in the hope that the Prime Minister will initiate re-evaluation to introduce fairness.",
