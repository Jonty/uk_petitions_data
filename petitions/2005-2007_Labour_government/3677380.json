This part of Ireland incorporates territory as follows: 55% is in what is called 'northern' Ireland; the remaining 45% is in the Republic of Ireland.\n\n\nProposal\nThat the correct name of the country which the PM governs is, and will therefore be, correctly, \"The United Kingdom of Great Britain and SCONEI\"\n\n\nPredicted Outcome\nImportantly, it will be an everlasting tribute to the PM's special qualities of communicating his vision of the future.",
