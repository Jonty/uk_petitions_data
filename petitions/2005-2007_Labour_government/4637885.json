            "background": "The current global warming phase has entirely natural causes and is well within the normal range of historical global temperatures.\nNo scientist has yet proven the theories that either Man's activities or CO2 have ever driven global temperatures.\nThe current 'witch hunts' against all human progress and development is damaging to the developed world and inhuman to the developing world.\nThe UK Government should adopt the lead by showing that it is unwilling to accept the false and untested science.\nEncouraging a clean environment along with the protection of the earth\u2019s assets are worthy in their own right. They do not need the protection of the false science of the Global Warming proponents.",
