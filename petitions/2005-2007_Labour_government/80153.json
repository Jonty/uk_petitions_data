We are a sovereign state, not the 51st state of America, and so we shouldn\u2019t blindly align ourselves with the foreign policies of the USA come what may. We as a nation need to speak with our own voice and stand up for what is morally just, which must surely be to actively promote peace through constructive dialogue. We must recognise that threats of military action and unjust sanctions affecting ordinary citizens can never achieve the desired result of peace without one side harbouring resentment and being put on the defensive, and at the same time adding fuel to the fire of those who would seek to justify violence in retaliation for such perceived injustices, so further threatening the security of British citizens.",
