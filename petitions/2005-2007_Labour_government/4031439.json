            "background": "This is clearly NOT the same as the one you linked me to. This is about a channel 4 programme on climate change and the evedence on CO2 not being responsible that it is linked to sun spot activity how is that identical????\n\nA recent documentory on Channel 4 had expert scientists from britain and USA with all charts relating to the earth temp in relation to CO2 emmissions. one chart showed clearly that at one point temp went up when CO2 was at a low emmission, secondly they catogoracly stated that CO2 has no control over the weather systems and went on to prove that it is sun spot activity that has this effect so this is a natural occurence and has gone on for thousands of years, It showed that the ice caps regularly expand and retract in fact we have had two Ice ages that never destroyed the world and at that time CO2 was high, also one of the biggest producers of CO2 is the SEA as sun spot activity warms the sea it gives of CO2 also one of the largest green house gas is water vapor. This attempt to tax us all because of CO\" emmissions is and I quote the scientist on the documentery \" It Is all lies \"",
