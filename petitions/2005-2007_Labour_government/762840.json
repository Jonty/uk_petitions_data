        "background": "It's not fair on rural communities who happen to be in picturesque locations to have all the houses bought up by Londoners who have more money than sense (or morals/scruples). It pushes up house prices and forces young people away from their place of birth because they can't afford to buy a house. Cornish villages are full of BMW's and Audi's (have they no sense of individuality?) in summer and are ghost towns in winter. Quite simply, it shouldn't be allowed at all, but at the very least it those who insist on havong 2nd homes should pay a higher cost.",
