            "action": "Consider revising the national curriculum to replace \"Religious Studies\" with  a \"Cultural Studies\" course which will have a wider context and include religious and non-religious cultural content as part of its teaching.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The teaching of RE in schools is a very divisive subject. Many parents object to their child being taught religion, for numerous reasons, and this often causes a conflict with the school. However, an understanding of religion is important in a wider enlightened view of world culture. To resolve these objections replace RE with cultural studies that as well as a study of world religions would also include appreciation of national identities, language, food, customs, etc. It would also include alternative world views such as humanism and Darwinism. This kind of course would be easier to gain parental support for, and in a changing world will give pupils a wider understanding of world culture.",
