        "background": "Millions of animals are killed every year in China and the fur trade is growing. The British fashion industry turns over more than \u00a3500m a year in animal fur, including cat and dog fur imported from China. These animals are kept in appalling conditions and treated abhorrently (including several reports of animals being skinned whilst still alive). We have no way of regulating this industry and no laws are in place for the animal's welfare in China. We do not know how the animal met it's fate or whether we are buying dog or cat fur. The only way we can stop the cruelty is to ban the international fur trade and this has to begin with the largest and most inhumane fur trader, China.",
