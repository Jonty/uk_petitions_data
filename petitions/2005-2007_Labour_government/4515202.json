        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "For years now there has been a significant crackdown on people who attend modified car meets who present no harm to the community in anyway.  There are however a few who tend to ruin this for everyone by mucking about and been a nuisance, these are who the police should target.  If all the police power was focused on targeting the offenders instead of the attendees this would create a more positive relationship with the police and also save more police time.  They send out forces of police vehicles to tackle a car meets when only one could sit and 'supervise' for the night, this in my opinion would save money and allow them to focus on more pressing matters we have.",
