            "background": "We at the Carp Connection would like the Environment Agency to review the Fishing Rod Licence system, and change the existing structure to the issuing of yearly Licences for single fishing rods (as opposed to the current system of yearly licenses for two rods), thus making the sport more accessible for younger people and those with less disposable income. This new licence system will lead to less people offending (fishing without a licence) whilst also being fairer on those wishing to use multiple rods (where local bylaws allow their use) by allowing people to pay additional charges only on the rods they actually use.",
