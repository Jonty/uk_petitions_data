The people of this nation are being treated with utter contempt and their opinions ignored. There should be a general election for the people to decide who the next prime minister will be. Tony Blair be honest with us all just this once. We are not as stupid as you think we are and are more than capable of making a democratic choice. Let the peoples voice be heard.",
