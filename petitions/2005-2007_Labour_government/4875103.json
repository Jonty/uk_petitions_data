            "background": "A claim for Incapacity Benefit or other sickness benefit, is subject to a medical examination. If after the examination you are found to be fit for work, you may decide to appeal against that decision. However your benefits will stop and you will be given Income support at a reduced rate for the duration of the appeal. This is considerably less than your usual benefit. For this reason it may cause undue suffering and claimants may even find themselves in debt. Once the appeal is heard and you have your decision, depending on the outcome, you will either receive all back dated benefits or have to payback the income support you have received. Usually a claim for jobseekers allowance or other benefit will offset this, but you must ask for the claim to be back dated. Benefits should remain as they were until a final decision is made after appeal. This is not the case and the benefits agency stop your benefit with immediate effect once they make a decision on the medical examiners report.",
