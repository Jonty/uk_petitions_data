        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There are fisheries that do not take the necessary precautions in order to prevent the deaths of numerous sea birds and other wildlife.  When a net is set out to sea, often there are hooks on the net in order to catch the fish; the problem is, once the fish have been caught on the hooks, they become a particuarly tempting catch for sea birds such as the Wandering Albatross.  The end result is the bird also gets caught on the hook after trying to get the fish, gets dragged underwater and drowns.  The fact is, Albatross population numbers are dropping significantly because of this way of fishing.  This injustice must stop, and a ban on all import of fish into the UK from these disreputable fisheries is the only way to save these animals.",
