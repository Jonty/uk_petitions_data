There are 730 unelected appointees in the Upper House; deselected or retired politicians, biased clerics, unknown patricians, donors with vested interests, unfeasibly wealthy businessmen and retired policemen. No true democracy presents its citizens with a fait accompli, imposes the views of a chosen few or provides grace and favour paternalist representatives who cannot be removed from office.",
