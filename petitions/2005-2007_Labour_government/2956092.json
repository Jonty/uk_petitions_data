            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The UK's current speed limits were researched and established by the UK Transport Research Laboratory - in the 1960s. Even then, the initial 70mph imposed limit was only experimental.\n\nHaving said that, in the 1960s, an average family car was incapable of 70mph. Similarly, some smaller cars today would struggle to touch 90mp. In reality, the 70mph is rarely adhered to. \nA typical free-flowing motorway has traffic sat between 80 and 90mph; even during periods of congestion, the majority of drivers have the sense to slow down in time to a more suitable speed without need for a 'variable speed limit'.\n\nI therefore propose the Prime Minister to review the current speed limit, and raise it to something more appropriate to a nation in the 21st century, not the 1960s.",
