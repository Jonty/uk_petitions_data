            "background": "The current situation with Wales, Northern Ireland and Scotland having assemblies, executives and local elected governments leaves the English people at an unfair disadvantage. Examples - The Scots have done very well and voted for free education for any Scot who attends their own universities and free personal care to any elderly Scot so that their families do not have to sell the family homes to pay for it, unlike their English friends. The Welsh have recently been given free prescriptions. If this type of regional government action is to also happen for the English then UK MP's must only be allowed to vote on issues which affect their own countries. Westminster must have an ENGLISH PARLIAMENT for issues that only affect the ENGLISH, this does not mean a number of meaningless Regional Assemblies within England but one ENGLISH PARLIAMENT with a voice for the English people.",
