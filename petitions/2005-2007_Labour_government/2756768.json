            "background": "The raising of APD for children travelling to and from Belarus to \u00a340.00 is an unfair and immoral tax, adding a burden of in excess of \u00a3187,000 in taxes having to be raised by the Chernobyl Children Life Line this year alone. Why should this amount be four times that of any other flight APD within Europe? If an exception can be made for The Highlands and Islands of Scotland then surely this tax could be and should be waived for all children travelling with Chernobyl charities?",
