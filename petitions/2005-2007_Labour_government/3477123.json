        "background": "I graduated in 2002 with a BA (Hons) in Primary Education with QTS (English) and have been penalised for choosing to complete a teaching degree as opposed to completing a degree and a PGCE.  The Government have decided that teachers who followed this route deserve a \u2018Golden Handshake\u2019 ultimately suggesting that they don\u2019t value those that chose the profession of teaching earlier.  I believe that all graduates who enter into teaching deserve a \u2018Golden Handshake\u2019.  If the government have paid PGCE\u2019s for entering the profession they should pay BA Hons QTS & BED graduates too!  Equal recognition of qualifications is due!  I believe all those who have graduated as teachers (and remain in the teaching profession) since the introduction of the 'Golden Handshake'should receive the 'Golden Handshake' payment from the government.",
