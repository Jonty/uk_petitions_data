            "background": "The primary purpose of the police is the prevention and detection of crime. When a vehicle has been found following its theft, it becomes evidence of a crime and should be treated exactly the same as any other piece of evidence. However, the police are insisting that if forensic tests are to be carried out on a vehicle to determine the identity of the thief, it must be recovered by their own (privatised) recovery services, which charge over \u00a3100 for the privilege, plus a daily storage charge. Although owners may recover the vehicles themselves, the police will not conduct any tests on the vehicle. This cannot be right and is a departure from the basic priciples of policing in the UK. We already pay a great proportion of our council taxes to the police authorities but it seems that they are now resorting to a stealth tax on the victims of vehicle crime.",
