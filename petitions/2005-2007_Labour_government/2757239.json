            "background": "Scotland are fed us subsidising other coutries in the United Kingdom. The Government say we do not subsidise anyone but documents released under the Freedom Of Information Act have proven that if Scotland were independent, they would be one of the richest countries in the world. Maggie Thatcher once said (while going to war in the falklands) that no country would ever be run by a Government it didnt want or elect.....she neednt have went to Falklands to find such a country, there was and is one just a few hundred miles up the road. Dissolve the United Kingdom and allow all countries the freedom they once had. They allowed the Republic of Ireland their freedom after keeping the most profitable part for themselves, so why do you think they wont allow Scotland to have their freedom? Because we're worth too much! If you are Scottish, sign this so we can be Land of the Brave once again, if you're Irish, empathise and sign, if you're English or Welsh......sign just to shut us up! Thank You.",
