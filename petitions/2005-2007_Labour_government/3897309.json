            "background": "Help further the cause of getting Brian Clough the knighthood, albeit a posthumous one, that he deserves. \nHis successes in football are well known. After an impressive career as a centre-forward was cut short, he began his managerial career with Hartlepool. He soon joined Derby County and won the Second Division and eventually the League Championship in 1972. Two years after his resignation in 1973, he found himself at Nottingham Forest. The club went on to win two European Cups, a League Championship and the League Cup four times. Only two things eluded him: the FA Cup, and the England manager\u2019s job. After 18 years at Nottingham Forest, Brian Clough retired.\nHowever it isn\u2019t just services to football that make him deserving. He had the uncanny ability instil in ordinary people the belief that they could achieve the extraordinary. He put the East Midlands on the map, did wonders for the cities of Nottingham and Derby, was very active in his community, and right up to his death invoked admiration, adoration, and respect from all those who met him. \nThis is your chance to undo one of the greatest injustices of recent times.
