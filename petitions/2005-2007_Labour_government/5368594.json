            "background": "currently the public can not scan animals to see if they are stolen/missing/lost so microchips are only good if the animal is taken & scanned by a vet, There should be a facility either within a police station reception for example where you can take an animal to be checked, this would re-unite so many lost pets with worried owners.",
