            "background": "British Telecom have introduced a penalty charge to all customers for not using the Direct Debit system. This goes against fairness for all and allow BT direct access to your bank account. Companies should not be allowed to dictate the method of payment that suits their profit model, and penalise you if you pay by a different method. This type of discrimination has been made illegal in Eire - it should not be allowed to continue here.\n\nDon't let companies such as BT erode your basic rights - why should you *pay* for making your own choice of payment method?",
