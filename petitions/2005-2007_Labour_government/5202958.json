It looks messy, confused and does not portray anything synonymous with the Olympics - in fact the lettering \"London\" and Olympic rings are tiny. It is not instantly recognisable as an olympic logo. The new logo is seen by some as a waste of money and not representing our country in any way. If you agree please sign this petition.",
