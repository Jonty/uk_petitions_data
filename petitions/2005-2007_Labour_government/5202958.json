            "background": "On 4th June 2007 the new 2012 London Olympic Logo was unveiled. It cost \u00a3400000 but in many people's opinion is no better than the previous coloured rings logo. It looks messy, confused and does not portray anything synonymous with the Olympics - in fact the lettering \"London\" and Olympic rings are tiny. It is not instantly recognisable as an olympic logo. The new logo is seen by some as a waste of money and not representing our country in any way. If you agree please sign this petition.",
