            "background": "Teaching Assistant pay can be at poverty levels. Many TAs are women / carers who need the various hours or working patterns to fit in with their responsibilities. (My child is autistic.)TA pay varies enormously across the UK. Fair in some areas, very very unfair in others. TAs are not paid above their official hours, but often have to work longer. TA pay should be rationalised and made standard across the UK. Someone should not have to claim benefits if they work 25 hours (often more unpaid) per week. TAs are being exploited to subsidise the delivery of education in the UK.",
