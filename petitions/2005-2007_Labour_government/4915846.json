            "background": "In every single country in Europe (EU and non-EU) diesel is considerably cheaper than petrol with the excepetion of the UK where the reverse is true. Diesel has been proven to be environmentally less polluting overall, especially with the advent of carbon offsetting by biodiesel. So why is the UK giving out the reverse message to the whole of Europe? Seems like exploitation of the populartity of diesel cars.",
