            "background": "HMRC currently offers free online forms for all its online services. Most other countries take the same approach but the IRS has chosen to stay out of the software market and has negotiated with the software industry for the industry to offer free software to certain groups. In the future, as online filing becomes the norm, we think that HMRC, working with the industry, should consider this approach and whether it might be better to leave software provision to the industry and focus HMRC resources on the infrastructure for exchanging electronic data with customers, agents and other intermediaries.",
