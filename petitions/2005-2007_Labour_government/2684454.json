They move to the area temporarily to get a place and then move away once allocated, maintaining there place at the school for the 1st child and any siblings for years after. We live walking distance to our local community school yet still no places available. My son have been allocated a school miles away! taking 35-40 minutes each way. Just putting more traffic on the roads!!",
