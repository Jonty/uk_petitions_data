            "background": "Contrary to popular opinion, private landlords don't make very much money from property rents and in most cases only keep them for their rising value. If the Government keeps bringing in more regulations, as soon as property prices stop rising many landlords will sell up possibly creating a property crash. Most landlords do a very good job under difficult circumstances, it's the non rent paying, property trashing tenants that need sorting out.",
