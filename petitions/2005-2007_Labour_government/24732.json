            "background": "Public schools must cease to offer curriculums that are designed to meet perceived needs in the market place. This policy sustains the system of privileged education.\n\nInstead, a focus is required upon the development of a sound intellectual foundation, enabling to all. This requires a complete reassessment of educational practice, a focus in early curriculums upon foundations, especially of mathematics and science, and a rejection of rote.\n\nEarly vocational training is unnecessary. A well-educated working-class with the intellectual capacity to appreciate its predicament and the capacity to independently identify effective solutions and occupations will benefit the productivity and quality of life for the entire community.",
