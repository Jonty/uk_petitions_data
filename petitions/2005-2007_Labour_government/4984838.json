To achieve such a reduction all heads of departments, from permanent under secretaries to the heads of local authority departments, should be required to achieve savings in their departments of RPI-x (where x=a percentage saving). All those who fail to do so should be regarded as incompetent and downgraded for retraining or sacked.",
