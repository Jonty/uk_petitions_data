Every householder had an inalienable right to employ whatever means necessary to protect themselves from intruders. Now the law specifies 'reasonable force', but this is open to very widespread interpretation. For a fit young male, fists might be an adequate deterrent, but a senior citizen would require a much better deterrent. Yet taking a sword from the wall would almost certainly result in the householder ending up in jail rather than the intruder. A much clearer law is required.",
