            "background": "I live just off junction 7 of the M20 in Kent. I am concerned at the amount of foreign cars and lorries that make up 75% of the traffic. The lorries travel closely together leaving very little room if any to even get on the motorway. Most people are pushed on to a separate slip road and have to join at nearly the next junction along. I propose this not just for revenue but for safety. Every accident I see on the M20 involves a foreign lorry, as all the traffic travels on their blind side. The lorries cause so much damage to the road which is under constant repair causing further delays. Why shouldn\u2019t they be made to pay a tax when they enter England. In France they use the toll system, in Switzerland every car entering is charged a one off annual fee of CHF35. If Kent should continue to bear the brunt of the European Gateway I think that this extra revenue could help build valuable facilities to ease the problems that come with unsustainable house building and over population. I think you owe it to the British public to stop this \u201cfree motoring\u201d at our expense and let us use the roads we pay so dearly for.",
