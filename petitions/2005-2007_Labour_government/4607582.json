            "background": "At the moment it is much more expensive to buy milk from a milkman than from a supermarket. Yet a milkman (providing there is enough local trade) uses an electric vehicle and ensures the most efficent form of re-cycling - re-use of a bottle simply by washing it! Subsidising a dairy on the basis that it it delivers within, say a 10 mile radius will ensure environmentally friendly transport,  the use of local produce and enable profits to go more directly to producers. Creating a new industry of local producers running home delivery businesses will also create new jobs.",
