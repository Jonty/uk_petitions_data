        "background": "The present proposals for teaching children from 14 to 19 are a gamble. \n\nThey fail to address any of the real problems by using a smoke screen of reorganisation to hide behind.\n\nThey are untried anywhere else.\n\nThey will be very disruptive to children who are presently in the education system.\n\nThey will make it almost impossible to recruit high quality teachers to the Island in the future.\n\nIn conclusion I do not feel the councils proposals are well thought out or meet the needs of the Islands students.",
