            "background": "Criminals should be forced to pay Compensation to Injured Parties where Personel Attack takes place.\nPersonel Attack should be qualified as :\n1/ Breakins, Damage,Attack in the Home, public place, rage attacks\n2/ Car Stealing and Damage\nExample: If somebody is attacked in the home,receives Property damage through Breaking and Entering and theft, The offender should receive a Dual sentence as follows\n1.Cost analysis of Damage including stress and injury.\n2. Offender received a 12 month sentence and Must work in Jail to pay compensation to victim(s) identified by the analysis\n3. Assuming the Cost of Property damage and Personel Injury amounts to \u00a3800.00\nthen a sentence of 12 months or \u00a3800.00 whichever is the greater to the offender.If the offender gets stroppy and refuses to work while in Jail then the offender stays there until the \u00a3800.00 is paid.There may be an initial shout about, but if the Law supports a no tolerence stance in this area i think the offenders will get the message",
