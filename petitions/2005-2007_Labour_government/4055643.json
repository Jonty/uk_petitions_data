        "background": "Liverpool Fc new owners are trying revise the plans that liverpool city council in there wisdom had passed,The original plans were for Liverpool Fc to build a 60,000 seat stadium in Stanly park,which is in an area where people do not have a lot,they now want to build a 80000 seat concrete bowl intead,\nIn this area there is not a lot for the kids to do,A lot of the kids and parents alike use the park ,I undertand the regeration to the area this MAY bring, but the council should not be ruining the park areas to help them to improve other areas,\nThey are also allowing public money to help fund this project,How the original plans were passed only our local council can answer, but if any further plans were agreed i think there should be a government enquiry into whoever is responsible for agreeing to those plans,\nAt a time when the enviroment etc and recycling in the home is being talked up by our goverment and we are all being encouraged to try to do our bit for the enviroment,it goes against all that the goverment SAYS it stands for by agreeing to allow building work to take over our parks in the first place let alone agreeing to any further plans.",
