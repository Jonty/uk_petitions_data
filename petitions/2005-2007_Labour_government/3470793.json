        "background": "South Shields pupils have, for many years, received a more than satisfactory education from the staff at Brinkburn School. The location is perfect for all who attend, however the council intend to close both Brinkburn and King George schools in order to build a super school.This is fantastic! The location of the new school is not fantastic!  Parents and residents do not want the new school to be built on the King George site.  This is already being refelcted in the new admission numbers for Brinkburn.  The education of the current pupils are also suffering dramatically.  Pupils have been writing into the local Gazette and it is terrible to read the thoughts and feelings of young people who are obviously distraught. Children in local primary schools have also expressed the veiw that they would not like to attend the new super school. The important factor is the route to the new school is unsafe and dangerous",
