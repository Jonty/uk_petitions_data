Most of BAE's own Software Engineers agree that this is\ninappropriate, and atleast one has been sacked because of it. We demand that the DPA challenge this decision, as it is madness to place the defence of the realm (apparently this decision will affect the Vanguard class nuclear missilesubmarines too) on technology owned and operated by a foreign corporation. Windows' unreliability is well known in software engineering circles.  Action must be taken to avert future disasters and loss of life amongst service personnel.\n\n(note: this petition is a re-submission of a previous request. I was unaware that links to other websites were against site rules).",
