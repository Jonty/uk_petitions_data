        "background": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to insist that the Defence Procurement Agency challenge BAE Systems' decision to base UK warships' Combat Management Systems on Microsoft\nWindows.\n\nRecently BAE Systems have made the decision to base all future warship Combat Management Systems (CMS) on Microsoft Windows. Most of BAE's own Software Engineers agree that this is\ninappropriate, and atleast one has been sacked because of it. We demand that the DPA challenge this decision, as it is madness to place the defence of the realm (apparently this decision will affect the Vanguard class nuclear missilesubmarines too) on technology owned and operated by a foreign corporation. Windows' unreliability is well known in software engineering circles.  Action must be taken to avert future disasters and loss of life amongst service personnel.\n\n(note: this petition is a re-submission of a previous request. I was unaware that links to other websites were against site rules).",
