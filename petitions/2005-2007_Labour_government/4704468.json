            "background": "The Met Line currently runs to Cassiobury Park on Watford\u2019s Outskirts. The TfL plan, to divert all services East from Croxley and onto the disused rail line to Watford High St, dual tracking it and linking up West Watford, creates a number of very important issues that will affect the local community at an outrageous cost of over \u00a3100M to us, the tax payers.\nThe closure of the Watford Met Station will result in local people having to use their cars to travel. A greater effect will be on students attending Watford Grammar School who commute from towns such as Rickmansworth, Chorleywood & Harrow.\nThe joining up of the Met Line and the main line railway will also cause concern for the local community. There would also be an extremely tight bend on the proposed viaduct from Baldwins Lane over the A412 by the Two Bridges at Croxley. Trains, including freight trains, running every 10 minutes, would make awful screeching noises (metal wheels on metal tracks) all night.\nThe amount of time and tax payers money that has been wasted in Consultants over the years without any forthcoming firm commitment that it will ever be constructed, has to stop.\nPlease abandon the Croxley Rail Link",
