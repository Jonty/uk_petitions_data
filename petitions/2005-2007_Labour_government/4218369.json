            "background": "Why is it, that in Britain, a country founded on Christian principles, it is permissable for the media to propagate the notion that what the bible says about Jesus is untrue?  If the media were to air programmes defaming the character of Mohammed or any of the numerous gods of other religions there would be fear of racial tensions.  There is a lack of reverent fear of the Lord.  It is not the first time that there have been ridiculous claims that Jesus had a family and no doubt there will be many more but we the undersigned stand up in opposition against the blasphemy against Jesus Christ who died for our sins and rose again.  We stand up against the spirit of anti-christ and it's message.  We the undersigned stand up in opposition against all media which seeks to defame the character of our Lord Jesus Christ.",
