            "background": "The current pay deal of 1% in April and 1.5% in October actually equates to an overall offer of just 1.9%, which is a slap in the face for public sector workers. Many of them work in very stressful jobs, and are paid very low wages compared to their colleagues in the private sector. A pay offer of 2.5% is considerably below the rate of inflation (which, according to the consumer price index, currently stands at 4.6%), and in real terms equates to a pay cut. Therefore, we would like to see the pay offer for public sector workers increased from 2.5% to a minimum of 5%, so that we actually receive a raise in our basic wage.",
