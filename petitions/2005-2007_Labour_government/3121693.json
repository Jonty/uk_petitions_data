            "background": "Allow horticulture as a alternative recognised physical activity in schools \nIf food crops are grown this could have the additional effect of linking in with other curriculum subjects such as biology or food technology.  It could enable a potentially aerobic activity for those children who are not naturally competitive if digging is involved. It will be an additional way to teach environmental issues as children see the effects of the environment on crop production.\nIf there are no ways to link with the curriculum it could be offered through after school clubs. It will provide children with a lesson they can then use throughout their life.",
