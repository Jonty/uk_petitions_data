            "background": "I speak as a non-smoker who doesn't appreciate smoke being blown over me when in a public house, restaurant or in fact anywhere that's an enclosed space.\n\nHowever, I am neither especially for or against the ban itself if smokers have the courtesy to not blow smoke over those who choose not to smoke, and who just happen to be sharing the same air as them in a public place.\n\nWhat I am concerned by is the fact that officers have been given the right to carry out covert surveillance by the methods stated above, in the name of this ban.\n\nBy allowing it to happen, a precedent will be set in terms of what is and isn't acceptable in terms of surveillance of us all, regardless of whether or not we smoke.\n\nOnce this precedent is set, we will see more and more excuses for this kind of intrusive, unneccesary and unjust monitoring of our daily lives to be inflicted upon us by the state without just cause, and as such would be further erosion of our civil liberties.",
