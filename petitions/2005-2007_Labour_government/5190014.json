            "background": "Patrick was found guilty of smuggling cannabis without any evidence, the drugs were even discovered in a bag that did not belong to him.\n\nPatrick was denied a lawyer, forced to sign a false confession after being deprived of sleep, burned with cigarettes, beaten with bamboo sticks and pliers applied to his testicles! \n\nMalluzzo was charged five months after his arrest, his trial did not start until a year later and was conducted in Hindi, a language Malluzzo does not understand. His lawyer claims a request for an interpreter was denied.  Malluzzo's lawyer then suffered a heart attack and the judgement was delivered without him.  Malluzzo was sentenced to 10 years imprisonment and is kept in a cage.  \n\nAn appeal to the High Court in Jaipur was rejected.\n\nIs this how a human being should be treated, simply based on assumptions?",
