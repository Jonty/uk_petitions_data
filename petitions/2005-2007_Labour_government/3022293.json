            "background": "Staff working at Luton Airport are unable to take any liquids of more than 100 ml in volume through security. Luton Airport has no 24/7 canteen facilities on site so most of us on nights are forced to take a packed lunch (As everywhere is closed!).\nThese packed lunches cant include any liquids over 100ml e.g. Yogurts, cans of drink, orange squash, tins of beans, spaghetti hoops, soup, etc. Even ready meals with gravy have been questioned. Surely when you are working outside at night when it\u2019s cold you must be entitled to eat something warm. Every night we have to work on aircraft systems etc and its insulting that we are not deemed \u2018trustworthy\u2019 (even though we have criminal record checks) to carry a strawberry muller fruit corner yogurt through security. We either need a good canteen or someone to use some \u2018common sense\u2019. Looking forward to tonight\u2019s Pot Noodle or another NASA meal.(just add water)",
