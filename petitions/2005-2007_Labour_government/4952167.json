While often this is for people I don't and I never will know sometimes it is quite reasonably requested by people I know such as my employers.  The adoption certificate tells everyone that I am adopted and this personal information is not something I want everyone to know.  I'm sure that many other adopted children have similar experiences.  I hope the Government can produce a cetificate for adopted children that does not scream \"Hey I'm adopted!\", when really it's nobody elses business.",
