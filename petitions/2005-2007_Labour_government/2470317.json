        "background": "Ask the government to stop this lunacy of partial or complete closure of many of our hospitals. Thousands of accident and emergency patients will have to travel miles on our congested roads. Many of these hospitals are brand new and it is sheer madness to close them. The government wants only to have a few major hospitals who will specialise in certain areas. People will thus have to follow the money rather than the money coming to where people need it. Make no mistake people will die. The government have already had estimates for the sale of the land. Remember the school playing fields fiasco!",
