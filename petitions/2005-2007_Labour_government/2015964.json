            "background": "Rubbish has always been collected on a weekly basis, however, recently it has now changed to fortnightly, usually recycling one week, rubbish the next.  This is unacceptable because we will cause a major rat problem which will spread disease, there will be maggots, flys, insects, foxes, disgusting smells, rubbish everywhere etc. Recycling is good but both need to be collected WEEKLY.  Provide more recycling centres and staff them.  Plus its USA that causes most rubbish not Europe, in some places in Europe the rubbish is collected daily.  The rubbish isn't going to go away just because it isn't collected.  It should be burnt not put in landfills.  How can rubbish not be collected weekly? are we turning into a third world country because correct me if I am wrong but we now have more people than ever in this country with busy lives; jobs, kids, pets, visitors and we don't need to be bin men too, they are paid, we arn't, so where is the money going?",
