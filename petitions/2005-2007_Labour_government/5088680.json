            "background": "In the media it is common to use facts and figures (statistics) to illustrate a point in an argument (polictical or other). Usually the use of these statistics is without context. for example - \"The health service has increased spending by 1 billion Pounds!\" sounds impressive and informative, but, what percentage of the health budget is 1 Billion? when and over how long was this increase made? Is it 1 Billion before or after adjusting for inflation over this period? How much is 1 Billion as a percentage of the GDP? How much is this increase as compared with similar services in the EU?\nA democracy is founded on the quality of information provided to it's electorate. I perceive a disenchanted electorate, given uninformative, misrepresentative sound bytes, being treated as fools and being denied real information to make real decisions for themselves. To engage the electorate, treat them with respect. Give us not just the facts - give us the picture, perspective, context, information necessarry to make informed decisions.",
