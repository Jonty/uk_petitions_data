        "background": "All of the government departments currently provide many/most application forms online with the intention that people download them, print them, fill them in and post them.\n\nI think that this is a good idea and saves a great deal of time.\n\nHowever, I think the forms should be more printer friendly.  They should have a white background, not contain blank pages and be designed with a blank margin around the edge (not many printers print to the edge).\n\nAs an example, I have downloaded form MN1 from the Home Office.  This consists of 16 pages with an orange background.  Three pages are completely blank except for the solid orange background.  None of the page numbers have printed because they are outside the print margin.",
