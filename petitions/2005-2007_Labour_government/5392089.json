They should have a white background, not contain blank pages and be designed with a blank margin around the edge (not many printers print to the edge).\n\nAs an example, I have downloaded form MN1 from the Home Office.  This consists of 16 pages with an orange background.  Three pages are completely blank except for the solid orange background.  None of the page numbers have printed because they are outside the print margin.",
