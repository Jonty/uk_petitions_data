Different Local Authorities raise the council tax annually by different amounts.\n\nMany Local authorities keep the rise low just before a General Election to try and influence the voting.\n\nIf we are to keep the council Tax, it is only fair that it is not increased above the annual rate of inflation and this keeps it even across the country.\n\nIt is time that we, as the people are able to predict and budget for Council tax increases.\n\nSupport this petition and lets save ourselves money.",
