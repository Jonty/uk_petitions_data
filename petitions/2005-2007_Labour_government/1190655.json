The society should be free from the government.\n\nThe 'logical' argument that abortion causes demographic decline is fallacy. Populations of the US and France, countries that legalised abortion on demand, are growing, while populations of Germany and Poland are STEADILY AND IRREVERSIBLY SHRINKING, which will cause the decline and the ultimate cessation of existance of those countries.",
