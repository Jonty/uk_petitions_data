I would rather sit between Jason Biggs and Adam Sandler on a long haul flight as they regale me with musical renditions of their dreadful films, than sit through an hour of this feculent mess.  There are so many other UK comedies to choose from instead, Mighty Boosh? Blackadder? Fry and Laurie? C'mon!  The Biased Broadcasting Corporation are incapable of making this decision alone, time for the hand of Gord to intervene.",
