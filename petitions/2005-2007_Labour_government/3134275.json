        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "1) Levy to be added to a litre of fuel, based on the average mileage UK drivers undertake to provide the revenue \u2013 the more you drive the more you pay, therefore a fair approach and an improvement on the proposed extortionate congestion charges. Estimate 4 pence a litre.\n2) Monies to replace Road Tax in full, in addition provide a basic 3rd party vehicle Insurance. If it drives, it pays and you are covered if it damages you/your property.\n3) Foreign drivers entering the UK would pay a levy to cover the fact they refuel on the continent then drive on our roads  \u2013 providing a level playing field for commerce.\n4) More of the actual money to be spent on Roads. In addition money should also be spent on improving Public transport, the only 100% sure way of fighting congestion, Tax breaks to Transport Companies that show marked improvements/efficiencies \u2013 including subsides for Transport fares.",
