            "background": "Private sector employees and businesses pay taxes that keep the rest of the country moving. Yet they share the roads with public sector motorist, pensioners and school run trips, causing billions of pounds in delayed commuting to work for PS workers.  \n\nNon PS car drivers only draw from the taxes paid by PS workers, and then pay it back in to the system. They do not contribute to the wealth of the country.\n\nPrivate sector workers should be given priority to get to over public sector workers, pensioners and school run trips. They should also be exempt from speeding fines, clamping, parking and other traffic offences. Traffic lanes should be coloured red for PS workers and normal tarmac for the rest. Any driver found in the private lane who is not a registered PS worker should be banned from driving for a year and forced to pay large fines.   \n\n2 plus lane schemes should be used to support private sector commuters and not school run families.",
