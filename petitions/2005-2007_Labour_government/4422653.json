            "background": "I am a Nurse working in substance misuse and recently I have had a patients child take a tablet of subutex and spit it out which meant the child was admitted to hospital. THe number of overdoses and deaths of children by taking other peoples drugs could easily be prevented by keeping them out of sight and reach of children.\nI have read that more children die through taking iron tablets than stumbling across methadone or other drugs.\nI am sure that it would be cost effective to give at a pharmacy a locked box for everyone who has children to make sure that children cannot access medication or at least reduce the risk.\nIf this saves one life then it's worthwhile. Please think of children and sign this petition.",
