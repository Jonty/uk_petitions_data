        "action": "mandate supermarkets to abolish free car parking at their stores.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We believe that supermarkets and other large out of town retail outlets should be forced to pass on the cost of providing their car parks to the customer directly in the form of car parking charges. Exemption could be provided for disabled or elderly drivers. Surpluses would be allocated to improved cycle parking and local public transport. \n\nThe availability of free car parking at supermarkets is a significant factor in the choice of the majority of customers to drive to the stores. \nThere are 3 main reasons why introducing charges is a good idea:\n1. It would reduce the number of car journeys, therefore reducing carbon emissions and congestion. \n2. It would be fairer for those customers of supermarkets who do not come by car, who would no longer have to subsidise the cost of providing the car park in the price of their groceries.\n3. It would be fairer for local town centre shops, who presently have an unfair disadvantage, being generally located in areas where car parking is charged for.",
