We are also told that it is illegal, for employers to discriminate against age. So how does the government intend to police their policies? Currently,  after being made redundant I feel that I am being discriminated  against at the age of forty seven, so if you feel you have been discriminated against whilst seeking employment, please add your name to this petition.",
