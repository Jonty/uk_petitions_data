All of the railway tracks and many of the main motorways are a travesty in what should otherwise be a \"green\" area.  In Canada and in the US there are STEEP fines against litter along any rail track or motorway.  let's also implement voluntary days that would allow clean-up of these areas!  Much of our income is dependent on tourism; shame on us for allowing americans to report that we have become a trash civilization!  Let's CLEAN IT UP!",
