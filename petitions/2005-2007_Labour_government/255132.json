Instead it can be a springboard for global multi-lateral nuclear disarmament talks.\n\nWe cannot reasonably expect states like North Korea and Iran not to seek to develop atomic weapons so long as those states that threaten them seem intent on retaining and replacing their own nuclear arsenals.\n\nThe time has surely come for multi-lateral disarmament talks, which will foster better international relations and avert the threat of a nuclear war. Why shouldn\u2019t we be the ones to initiate talks? There could even be a Nobel Peace Prize in it - that would surely be a legacy worth leaving.",
