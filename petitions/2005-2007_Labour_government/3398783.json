They have good reasons for the good of their business.\n\nWe supply supermarkets and it is very hard to make a living.\n\nWe need to be able to make management decisions freely.\n\nI suggest the government protect basic human rights but leave it at that.\n\nThis would make UK PLC much more competitive and ironically would lead to more and better jobs for everyone.\n\nThe current law only protect lazy troublemakers and is disadvantaging the other 99.9% of the workforce.",
