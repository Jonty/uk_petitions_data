            "background": "'Vulture funds' are companies which exploit the efforts of western countries to write off third-world debt. When a rich country offers debt relief, for instance Romania's offer to write off $40m worth of Zambian debt for just $3m in 1999, the vulture fund moves in to 'buy' the debt at the cheap price, before charging the debtor country the original ($40m) plus interest. Although organisations such as the IMF have condemned the practice, it remains technically legal. International bodies should act to regulate this unscrupulous industry and limit their obscene profits, and Mr Blair should use his influence in Washington and elsewhere to make this a top priority for the international community.",
