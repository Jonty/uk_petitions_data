            "background": "To much of our beautiful countryside is being destroyed by building! Kentish orchards are being grubbed and transformed into housing estates. This affects both our wildlife, our carbon emissions and traffic. A perfect example of this is Furfield Park in Parkwood. A meadow, homed to mice, hedgehogs and butterflies destroyed to make a modern estate. Again adding to traffic on Loose Road. Now we have to eat New Zealand apples that have travelled halfway across the globe. Because they are cheaper because they are easier to find.\n\nWe urge you, action must be taken soon or The Gardens Of England will loose it's beauty that it is famous for.",
