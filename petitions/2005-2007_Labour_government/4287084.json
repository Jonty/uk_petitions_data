However, I have become increasingly frustrated by both the government and charity organisations continuously stating the myth that DV is a \"man on woman\" issue. The figures they use rely on crime statistics only-not on the results of many research papers which show this is simply not true. This is a social issue, not a gender issue and will not be resolved until such a time as women are stopped treated as victims and men as demons.",
