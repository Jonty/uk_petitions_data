            "background": "There is a nationwide campaign to reduce staff hours in or to totally close local libraries, especially those situated in villages. This particularly penalises those of us who live in rural communites with poor access to local transport who will lose a vital community facility and be unable to access any library facilities.\nStaff jobs are being down-graded, even though effectively the staff are being asked to do the same work and although their salaries are protected for 2 years, they will be reduced after that. No concern is being shown to the public service given by local libraries in offering Internet access, facilities for children to encourage literacy, readers' groups and the general community spirit that is engendered by good libraries.",
