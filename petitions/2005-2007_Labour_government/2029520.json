            "background": "Quite basic really.  It is unprecedented in British history for a chancellor of the exchequer to introduce taxation changes and make them retrospective.  This chancellor has made it a nasty habit.\n\nIt is immoral to do so and this most recent of money snatching practices should stop now.  The most recent one being the increase in Air Passenger duty, enforced upon travellers who had previously already purchased tickets for future travel.\n\nPlease support this petition.",
