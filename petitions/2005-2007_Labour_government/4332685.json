            "background": "Cormorants are currently a protected species, these natural seabirds are predating inland waters all over the country, in the Prime ministers constituency some 90+ birds have been counted on one natural water! We would like to see the Prime minister take some time to look at this problem and produce a solution. DEFRA currently issue licences to shoot certain numbers of these birds, some waters which are visited by upto 16 birds per day were given licences to shoot 4 birds per year. We would welcome a solution to a problem that costs fishery owners and fishing clubs millions of pounds a year.",
