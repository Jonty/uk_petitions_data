        "background": "Create an amnesty for young \"over-stayers\", those who, at the time of entry did not have control of their application for the right to live and work in the UK. These \"over-stayers\" are being persecuted for the failures of their families/sponsors. Some, are forced into committing criminal offences to provide money for the families that they have built here in the UK. By creating the amnesty, fewer offences will be committed, jobs in special trade industries may be filled and the quality of lives for these people will be vastly improved. \nThese people do not want to be a drain on UK resources, instead be a credit to themselves and the UK. \nThe famous saying says: \"give a man a fish and you have fed him for today. Teach a man to fish and you have fed him for a lifetime\"",
