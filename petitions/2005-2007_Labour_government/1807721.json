We object to inconsequential made-up problems being bandied around by magazines more concerned with self publicity and self promotion. We further believe that the sale of motorcycle frames with v5 should not be made illegal as a knee jerk reaction to certain criminal activities since this would only affect the vast majority of honest motorcycle restorers and enthusiasts.",
