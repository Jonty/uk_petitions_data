        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I suggest a potential way to combat the escalating gun and knife crime in our country, is to take school kids between the age of 11-14, to a prison to be lectured by selected prisoners on the need to NOT fall into crime, and generally put the fear of GOD into them. So at least the child can fully undestand, the implications of chosing a life of crime. When my 15 yrs (now 16) was going of the rails a bit, shop lifting, and getting into fights. I arranged a visit to the local police station, which involved a long 40 minute talk with, the police sgt who was also a youth liaison officer, and a tour of the cells. This along with sustained (but gentle) pressure and words of empowerment, has enabled my son to turn his life to a new direction. I believe many more parents would benefit from, this if it were introduced as a field trip while still at school. This would free schools up to be HONEST and maintain their INTERGRITY in regard to their schools own problems with gangs/crime BEFORE the the child is recruited by the local hoodlums and into a life of drugs and crime. Thanks",
