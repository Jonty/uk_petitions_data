            "background": "Accidents could be reduced and hopefully lives saved by taking lorries/juggernauts/trucks (in particular the continental ones) off our roads during peak commuting hours. These behemoth's cause carnage when involved in RTA's and only make our congested motorway's even worst. By restricting them off the roads/motorways during say the hours of 6am~9am and 4pm~7pm, would make it not only safer for car commuters, but congestion would be eased dramatically.",
