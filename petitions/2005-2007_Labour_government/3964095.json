        "background": "With increased traffic on the roads, a small corner of Kent is bearing the brunt of a planning error made in the 70's.\n\nFor the sake of some work on one junction, villages such as Borough Green, Seal and Riverhead would see a dramatic reduction in heavy traffic, making the roads, which are under constant use, safer, whilst keeping heavy traffic on the M20, M26 and M25.\n\nThis would also improve transport links for traffic on the A21 corridor, removing traffic from the back roads such as the A26 affecting West Malling, Hadlow and Tonbridge, all in all improving the local environment and, as said before, improving safety on the road network in West Kent, whilst improving links to the South East coast, and towns alongside the A21.",
