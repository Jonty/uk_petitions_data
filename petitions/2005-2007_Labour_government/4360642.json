        "background": "David Nugent of Leeds' Debut goal for England versus Andorra on the 28th March 2007,should not be allowed to stand. This is because the ball was already well on the way to crossing the line when he poked it over to STEAL the goal from the rightful owner, Jermain Defoe of Tottenham Hotspur. I petition that this goal should be taken from Nugent, and given back to Jermain Defoe. This is the only fair and right thing to do.",
