            "background": "My son was killed by his father in 2002 and it took us 18 months to bury him due to the fact his father denied the killing. And now ive just heard that my sons killer is due to be released after serving only 3 yrs in prison for my 2 yr old sons manslaughter ( he got 7 yrs originally) and he got early release due to criminal justice act 2003 being brought in. Im currently campainging so i can help other families who find themselfs in my situation and hopefully ease there pain as mine is so intense. What i want to see is when a judge passes a sentance the killer has to do the full sentance, no time out for good behaviour and so on they do a full term, so they will not be able to fall back on the criminal justice act 2003 they will be exempt. It changes your life forever when your child is murdered and the pain doesnt ease so why should the killer be able to get on with there life all happy, we need justice for victims and families and stop pussy footing around the criminal. Please show your support and pass this petition on to everyone you know as we need a over haul of the justice system.",
