            "action": "direct the Dept for Transport & HM Treasury to release 'ring-fenced' funds to Hampshire County Council to increase the capacity of the 3 mile section of the A32, Fareham/Gosport road, to facilitate an average speed of at least 12mph, or quicker, at peak travel times.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Gosport, the largest town in England without a railway, is a peninsular town to the west of Portsmouth hbr, it\u2019s population is 80,000+ and this number is growing annually due to central government directed house building directives. Only one direct route (A32) connects Gosport to Fareham, a neighbouring off-peninsular town to the North-West, and the M27. The A32, a single carriageway, was planned to be made a dual-carriageway in the 1970\u2019s by Hampshire County Council but those plans were shelved and have never materialised. At peak times this 3 mile road takes 45 mins or longer to travel; an avge speed of 4mph or less. This affects the Gosport economy & the jobs available as employers are loathe to set-up/stay due to the A32 transport problems, causing an ever increasing number of Gosport folk to HAVE to travel on the A32 to find work. Gosport residents deserve a travel time of at least 15 mins or better on this 3 mile A32 section at peak travel times; an avge speed of 12mph or better.",
