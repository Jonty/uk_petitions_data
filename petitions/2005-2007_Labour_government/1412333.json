            "background": "The TPS registry is a service which allows people to opt out from receiving unsolicited calls from telemarketing companies. While most companies comply with this scheme this however does not stop the large numbers of unwanted calls made every day. In addition there exists a large problem with phone scams (people are tricked into ringing back a premium rate number). The key problem is that there is no easy way for the public to report violations, and these people can often apply thier scams for months before anyone is able to shut them down - after which they usually simply change numbers and start again. I propose that the government set up a special number similar in function to the 1471 service currently being used - I suggest 159357 (the form of an 'X' on the phone keypad) which would quickly log the details of the last call received to a central database and allow evidence to be collected to identify and prosecute those responsible.",
