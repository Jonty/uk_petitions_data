            "background": "Lorries are slow and when overtaking each other, especially on hills, slow all traffic down. This causes cars and lorries behind to drive even slower ending in traffic jams. Also lorries coming onto slip roads make left lane drivers slow down to allow them to enter the motorway. Not only will this solve congestion it will also reduce accidents.",
