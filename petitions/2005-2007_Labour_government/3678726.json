            "background": "Following the announcement of a staged pay award on 01/03/2007 of 1.5% in April followed by 1.0% in November this effectively means a pay cut for nurses throughout the country.  Nurses should not be made to pay for the mistakes that the Politicians have made regarding the NHS as we are the backbone not the scapegoats.  Unless Politicians take a matching paycut, it is sending out a message that nurses are undervalued.",
