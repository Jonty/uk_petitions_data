        "background": "Dear Tony,\n\nI have recently been diagnosed with prostate cancer which has spread to most of my skeleton.\n\nI can only commend the care and treatment I received from my local Surgery and St Mary\u2019s Hospital Solent Unit Portsmouth.\n\nHowever as a shareholder in UK plc, I see no reason why we as a nation cannot have the same arrangements as other developed countries to have a system of annual health checks. We seem to be able to do this for our cars and central heating boilers but what about the health of the nation ? I'm not asking for these health check to be free but part of a regime to prevent rather than repair, even if the initial cost would have an impact for a number of years requiring more nurse practitioners and GP\u2019s. \n\nI have a strong affection for the NHS having worked in two London teaching hospitals.\n\n\nAgain \u2018Prevention is better than cure\u2019 as we all know is common sense.\n\nPlease, please, please, support my campaign and do all that you can to assist me in doing my bit for others.\n\nYou never know Tony it might be you next so please make sure you get your PSA level checked ASAP.\n\nBrian Nicholls FRSH",
