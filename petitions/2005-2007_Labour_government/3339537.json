            "background": "Many motorists in this country are becoming increasingly violated by the continual stream of financial burdens penalising the use of the British population's vehicles on the roads. An annual charge for all foreign vehicles to use our roads should now be introduced and monies gained used to fund the replenishment of our failing transport infrastructure. An example of this practice being operated successfully is Switzerland, where, such has been carried out for numerous years.",
