        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The government seems to want to charge more and more in taxation to combat climate change. The british people are among those taxed the highest in the world, we pay tax on our income and then we pay additional taxes on what we spend. The problems with climate change all stem from one issue the destruction of Forrests, the felling of trees. Trees absorb CO2 and produce Oxygen so this is the answer Not Taxation. It's not rocket science, Plant more trees and create more forrested areas the rate of climate change will slow and the country will be greener. So it's simple Taxes don't control climate change it just makes us the british public worse off. However if we had more forrests we will have a country with the cleanest air and a countryside with outstanding beauty. And we could still achieve a 20 % reduction in CO2 by 2020 but not at the expens of the tax payer.",
