The benefit of having the option of capital punishment is that maybe just a few of the criminals may think twice before committing the crime. Also the law abiding citizens would not have to pay to home the repeat offenders of sick sex crimes and murder as they could be sentenced to death. At least then the jails would have room to house those convicted of the more nuisance crimes and maybe do some good with them.",
