        "background": "It is very easy to spend someone else's money and for the last ten years because the economy has been strong, the Government has found it very easy to spend taxpayer's money. Had this been their own money it is very unlikely that they would have built the Dome, the Scottish Parliament, the awning at the House of Commons, organised the failed regional assembly elections, all of which wasted millions of pounds. Making such misspending a criminal offence might make Government behave more seriously with our money.",
