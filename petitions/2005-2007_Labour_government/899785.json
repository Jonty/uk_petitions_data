            "background": "With the issue of global warm and the environment becoming ever more at the forefront of politics, I urge the prime minister to set a minimum tax for caravans and motor homes. It is my theory that as the cars towing these \"creations\" are normally heavily loaded with the extra weight of passengers and luggage - not to mention the weight of the object it is towing. This extra strain on the engine causes the car to work harder hence an increase in CO2 emotions. If the government is forcing a financial burden on those who drive 4X4 \"gas guzzlers\" sure the same rule should apply to the slow moving, congestion causing creations. I urge the government to consider this as a really solution to the road congestion problem.",
