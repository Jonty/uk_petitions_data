            "background": "The EMA system where some students receive up to \u00a330 a week (dependant on family income) encourages students to only stay in college for the money, and often leads to disrupting the learning of those that want to be there. The income from the parents does not determine how much the children receive. My parents ( both in education) can't afford to give me anywhere near what my peers receive - from my parents taxes and yours!",
