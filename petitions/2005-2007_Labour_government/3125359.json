            "background": "The Royal Navy has decreased in size dramatically.  It is so small now that it is believed that Pakistan has a better Navy than we do.  I am proud of this country, but reducing its Navy size decreases the role in which we play throughout the world.  I think we should become a world power, as this would mean that we have global influence.",
