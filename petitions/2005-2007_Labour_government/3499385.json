            "background": "Off road sports in this country are expanding, but with declining area`s for usage. These sports have for decades produced great world champions from this country, enhancing this countrys reputation worldwide. A ban of any description would be of detriment to all of us, is this country to be governed by people who have nothing better to do than complain about noise that occurs less than 10 times a year. Where will all those off road enthusiasts go if these sports are banned wholesale? riding illegally? streetcrime? joyriding?. If you love off road sports then put your name to this petition and show those who have nothing better to do than moan that we will not be pushed around",
