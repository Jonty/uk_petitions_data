These people believe 'petrol heads' should be punished for a) using one of man's greatest creations for enjoyment b) commuting to work by car c) travelling on holiday by car etc, I could go on. Not everyone wants to spend each day cultivating tomatoes and lettuce patches as imagine these people do. Not everyone that uses a car is a petrolhead either. (Although I most certainly am!)",
