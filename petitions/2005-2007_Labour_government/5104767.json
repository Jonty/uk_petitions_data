            "background": "Tal Bahadur Pun single handedly stormed Japanese machine gun postsduring WW2. His courage in the face of almost certain death earned him the V.C. The Gurkhas extraordinary act of valour earned him many Royal admirers and he was invited to the Queen's Coronation and had tea with the late Queen Mother. \n His application to live in the UK has been declined after he was told he failed to demonstrate that he had strong ties with the UK!!!!!!!\n Come on Ladies and Gentlemen, show Tony Blair and the rest of his gutless party how strongly we object to this absurd decision and give this man the help he needs and make his last few years on this earth as comfortable as possible.\nPlease sign this petition and tell everyone you know.",
