            "background": "Inset days (Baker days) allow staff training in Schools, they are \"inset\" into the teaching time but do not require the presence of children and are usually added to school holiday periods. This shows a lack of appreciation for the difficulties of working parents who must arrange extra child care or take extra days off work themselves. There is no intrinsic reason why such training should be \"inset\" at all and no sensible reason why training could not be conducted within the paid periods of school holidays",
