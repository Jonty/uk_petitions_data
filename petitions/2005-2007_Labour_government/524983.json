        "background": "Linking child support payments to the Inland Revenue would mean that parents who are earning are no longer able to refuse to make payments.  The money will beautomatically deducted from pay and paid to the parent who is the child's primary carer.  This would result in extra work for the Inland Revenue but would be an efficient and managable system and would surely be more successful that the now obsolete CSA.",
