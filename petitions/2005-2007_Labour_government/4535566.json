        "background": "Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Nlandu, human-rights lawyer, presidential candidate and mother of 4, has been held in Makala prison in the Democratic Republic of Congo since November 21 2006. She was arrested for \u2018inciting a riot and the possession of firearms\u2019 by the Police Special Services who are under the direct control of President Kabila. There is no evidence to convict her because she is not guilty, yet she remains in prison (now seriously ill) and in appalling conditions, facing possible execution. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch are calling for her release and 60 British MPs have asked the government to put pressure on Kabila. It isn\u2019t enough though. As of today, 9th April 2007, Marie-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se is still in prison. She is not a prisoner of crime or war, but a prisoner of conscience. We, in Britain are in a fortunate diplomatic position: we have the power to affect change. Please put your name to this cause. It is time to stand up against those who threaten peace, freedom and democracy in our world. \n\nPlease visit www.freemarietherese.com",
