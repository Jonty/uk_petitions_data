These patients cannot undertake work that takes them away from their Dialysis unit, have a holiday, attend family celebrations ( weddings, baptisms etc ) or visit friends or relatives.  They call on the prime Minister to provide sufficient spare capacity in Dialysis units around the country to enable patients to move between units.  This would dramatically improve what is currently a poor and restricted quality of life. After all the Prime Minister puts high value on his holiday - he should not deny patients the same basic human right.",
