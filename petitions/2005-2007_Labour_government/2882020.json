Whilst it is obvious in most casses that no such assault has taken place, most trials can take 12 months or more. In all that time the accused is suspended from duty and has to live with the threat of conviction all that time. When cases are thrown out and the accused should have no stain on their character, like myself, on the CRB form, the case is highlighted as if the accused is guilty but has got away with it. It is wrong to highlight the case in question and should not apply on the CRB form.",
