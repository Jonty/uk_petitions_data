            "background": "Stamp Duty is a continuing burden on first-time buyers.  The threshold has not increased in line with house prices, making matters worse.  In 1997, only around a third of first-time buyers paid Stamp Duty.  Today, more than half of homebuyers pay the tax.  Doubling the starting threshold to \u00a3250,000 would take the burden off a lot more homebuyers by eliminating the 1p Rate.  The cost of doing this would be around \u00a31.8 billion in 2007-08.",
