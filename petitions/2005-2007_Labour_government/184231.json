Anyone who thinks this law is unfair is just selfish and needs to think about what they're inflicting on others, rather than just thinking about themselves. HOWEVER, we need a law that forbids people from lighting up when there are babies and young children nearby, whose lungs are even more sensitive than an adult's.\n\nIt really saddens me to see mothers (and fathers, etc.) walking along the street (or in their own homes) and blowing tobacco smoke in their kids' faces. THIS IS CHILD ABUSE - wafting hydrogen cyanide into a baby's face would land somone in jail... so why not tobacco smoke?",
