            "background": "My brother has just been diagnosed with this devastating lung cancer caused by working with asbestos.  His oncologist has stated that we are at the beginning of an epidemic and that by the year 2020 every family will know someone who has been affected by this cancer.  There is no cure.  We need the Government to put funds into researching this disease.  We know it is caused by being in contact with asbestos but the government must also clamp down on companies that have admitted still using asbestos up until 1999. A cure will be too late for my 50 year brother as once diagnosed the life expectancy is usually 7-12 months.  All this for working since he was 15 years old and never asking the Government for a penny!",
