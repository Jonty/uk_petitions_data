Ultimatums have been given to the Khartoum Government, all of which have been ignored and not followed up on. The International community pledged that another Rwanda must never be allowed to happen and yet it has as, generally speaking, the outside world has stood by and watched. \n\nThe blood of countless innocent Sudanese people is already on the conscience of the international community and I respectfully urge you to use all the influence you have with other world leaders to insist that the Khartoum Government end this conflict and suffering as a matter of great urgency.",
