            "background": "Local authorities have been relieved of the requirement to indicate the time-limits and other conditions relevant to any specific restricted-stopping area (e.g. single-yellow line or loading zone)on a sign located at that zone, being permitted instead to provide only blanket signage for a controlled parking zone (CPZ), the onus being on the driver to find where the CPZ signage is.\nDrivers unfamiliar to an area are increasingly being fined due to being unable to find - or in some cases, properly interpret - the CPZ signage.  This petition calls for the re-instatement of specific signage of all parking, stopping and loading restrictions, the onus being on the local authority to provide clarity to the driver such that the offences do not occur, rather than creating confusion and opacity which results in more offences (i.e. unwanted parking congestion) and fines (i.e. income for the councils). The cost of the improved signage to be hypothecated from parking fees and fines.",
