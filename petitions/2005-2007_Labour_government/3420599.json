            "background": "It has taken approximately twenty years to get rid of the previous American anti-nuclear weapons system. Mr. Blair now deems it a wise decision to once again make Britain a primary enemy target in the event of a nuclear war. This is yet another example of the current PM bowing to the wishes of the United States of America. With enough signatures, there is some hope that Mr. Blair will be forced to reconsider this reckless idea. This petition will be open for one month. Parliament is due to address this matter in March, so it is paramount that action is taken.",
