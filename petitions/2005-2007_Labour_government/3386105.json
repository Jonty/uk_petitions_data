            "background": "At the moment it is almost impossible for the average UK citizen to emigrate to the US, though US citizens can use the UK\u2019s HSMP program to emigrate to the UK there is no return visa agreement for UK citizens to easily emigrate to the US. Both Australia and Canada have negotiated (as part of treaty agreements) special immigrant/dual-purpose visa categories to make it easier for their citizens with a degree or suitable profession to emigrate to the US, and Chile and Singapore are each allocated part of the h1b visa quota. The UK despite it\u2019s close ties to the US has no such immigrant visa category, meaning that it\u2019s simply not possible for the vast majority of UK citizens to take advantage of our traditional ties to the US to emigrate there. This petition is to ask the British Prime Minister to try and reach a better visa arrangement with the US for immigration visas, something similar to the arrangements which Canadian and Australian citizens currently benefit from.",
