This word has been abused far to often by far left groups in order to stop democratic discussions before they can take place. Calling someone this word when this is no evidence to suggest they are just because they do not agree with a policy is offensive and just as bad as calling someone a racist name.\nI want a stop put to the misuse of this word by Politically correct groups and left-wingers.",
