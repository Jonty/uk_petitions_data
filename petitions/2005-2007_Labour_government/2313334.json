            "background": "The Pension Protection Fund is financed by private company schemes and underwritten by the government. It guarantees the pensions of pensioners over 65 yrs of age in the event of closure of the sponsoring company but gives only limited protection for pensioners between 60 and 65 who are just as vulnerable. Their pensions are already reduced to take into account the extra years. Most early retirees are for ill health or have been made redundant with little or no chance of getting a comparable job. The government acknowledge this by crediting NI for over 60s who are not in work.",
