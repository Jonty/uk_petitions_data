        "background": "The current trend of attempting to drive 4x4s off the roads in major towns and cities is supported but there is a section of the community for whom 4x4s are a feature of their very existence and necessary to carry out their normal business. If a 4x4 is owned by a rural occupation or a resident of a rural community that vehicle should be more reasonably taxed than that of a city dweller. They already pay high fuels taxes and usually have higher mileage because of their remoteness.",
