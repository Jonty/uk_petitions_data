I am annoyed that the producers have done nothing to react to this blatent bullying, some of which is of a racist nature. At the very least I would have expected a verbal warning. As these people are being paid by channel 4 they are in fact employees, and if employees behaved in this way in a workplace they would be disciplined and the employer taken to tribunal.",
