            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Ever growing numbers of elderly with ever-greater complexity of cases means that care services for the elderly and disabled are now under severe financial pressure. Already two in three councils restrict care such as assistance with dressing, washing and cooking to those people with needs assessed as \"critical\" or \"substantial\". Councils do not want to do this but have no choice due to a lack of funding from central government. This problem will only intensify as the number of people aged 65 and over will increase by more than 80% to 17 million in the first half of this century; the number of those 85 and over is expected to double to more than 1.8 million by 2028. The government therefore must recognise the true scale of this crisis and provide, starting with this year's Comprehensive Spending Review, adequate resources to allow local authorities to meet the needs of some of the most vulnerable in our society. They must also work with local government to find a long-term solution.",
