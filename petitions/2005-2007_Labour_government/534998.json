            "action": "introduce legislation capping the margin of profits made by essential utility companies.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Since the privatisation of the essential utilities the consumer has seen the costs of these services rise at alarming, and often, unjustifiable rates.\nThe companies in making extremely large profits are reluctant to channel these profits back into the businesses they run. water companies fail to repair the aging systems that deliver the water.\nGas and electricity companies have, in some cases, more than doubled prices within the last two to three years citing the price of oil etc as justification. \nThese price rises are swift and yet as the prices of raw materials drop there is reluctance to reduce the price to the consumer. \nThese points coupled with the fact that many of the companies are now owned by companies abroad mean that money is being bled from the uk economy into the economies of other countries. \nWe believe that the essential utilities of this country should be there to benefit the people of this country.",
