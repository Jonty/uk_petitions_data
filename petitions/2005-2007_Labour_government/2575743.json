            "background": "The congestion problem is more to do with the usage of motorways and our core roads. I therefore petition the Government to ring the following changes:\n\n1) Ban, fine or teach people how to use a motorway, particularly in MIDDLE LANE DRIVING.\n\n2) Address the real issue of industrial transportation on the road at peak times - lorries do not NEED to be adding to congestion between 7-9am and 4-6pm, so they should be removed, a la  France, from either the road entirely or the middle lanes during these times specifically.\n\n3) Make car-sharing for school-run mums/dads COMPULSORY and start implementing PROPER publicly available transport - if congestion is to ease, we need less 4x4's carrying a single child one mile to school.\n\nThese changes would make a massive difference to both the issue of pollution and the issue of congestion. We would ALL benefit, so sign here now.",
