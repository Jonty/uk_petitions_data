            "background": "Young drivers are always forced to be driving cheap and unsafe cars due to the fact that they are young drivers. Surely, the better you do in your test, the cheaper your insurance should be? If insurance was lowered, a large number of good drivers would benefit from cheaper insurance that they deserve, for, obviously, being good drivers having passed their driving tests with good marks. With all the other costs at the young age too, it is hard to afford such high sums.",
