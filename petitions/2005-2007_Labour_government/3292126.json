            "background": "The government continues to close special needs schools, despite the fact that many of the parents of children attending these schools have had to fight LEA's tooth and nail to get them a place there.\nWhen will the government realise that these schools will help them in the long run? Children who attend these schools would end up reaching a potential they wouldn't get in mainstream school, Therefore needing less support from government in later life. \nNo-one says 'inclusion is wrong' but the education needs to fit the child, not the child fitting in with the LEA budget!\nIt's about time the needs of the child were put first!",
