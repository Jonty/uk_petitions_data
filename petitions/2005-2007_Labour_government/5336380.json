            "background": "ESTATE AGENTS SHOULD PAY FOR THE EXPENSES CAUSED TO THE \"GAZUMPED\" BUYER.\n\"Gazumping\" is when a home buyer looses the property of their dream because someone else offered more money for it during the selling process. Nothing can protect the buyers from this unacceptable english tradition. Estate agents are often the sources of gazumping (they don't mind having a higher commision at the first buyer's expense). Estate agents should be held responsible for this behaviour and they should pay for the consequences.  If the sellers don't sell with an agent then they should become responsible for the expenses themselves. But in no case after the buyer has already suffered the gazumping should they pay for the expenses they have incured (survey, sollicitors, ect...).",
