        "background": "A young man with mental illness has recently been released from prison with no accomaodation to go to and no one to support him (other than an unrelated elderly pensioner who keeps a watchful but limited 'eye on him').  He came from an unstable home background and his family home no longer exists.  Without appropriate care in the community it seems reasonable to assume that it will be dificult for him to avoid reoffending. If Vunerable prisoners are to be released ( particularly if being released early) they need to be approriatley supported.",
