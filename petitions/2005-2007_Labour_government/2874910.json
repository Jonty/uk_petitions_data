            "background": "If the government wishes to go ahead with the vehicle tracking and pricing policy, the following need to occur in tandem, with such a policy. \n\n1. Alternative cost effective transport must be provided \u2013 e.g. standard open return Bristol to London is \u00a3125.  We need cheap and frequent public transport comparable to using our cars.  \n\n2. School buses should be provided for those below secondary age, or who live more than 2 miles away. \n\n3. Encourage companies to allow working from home and use of teleconferencing \n\n4. Any system, which stores data about us, the public, as charging per mile would, needs to be thoroughly assessed. Personal freedoms need to be protected.  \n\n5. If such issues were addressed, we the public would potentially support the governments position.",
