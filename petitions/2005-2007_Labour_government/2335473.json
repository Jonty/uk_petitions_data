            "background": "Vosa and the EU have in the last few months, have started to restrict 7.5 tonne lorries(small lorries) to 56mph (90kph - the same speed as HGV Rigid trucks and artics trucks.\nAs a 7.5 tonne driver this is causing a danger to not just myself, but other road users. With thousands of more trucks being restricted due to this new law, this will add to the lorry traffic in the near side lane, cars unable to take their exit, duel carriage roads becoming blocked up with lorry drivers unable to overtake each other, cars being caught in miles and miles of traffic because of this, and the safe 2 second rule being thrown out of the window.\nIf your a lorry driver or a car driver, you will understand where i'm coming from. \nThis is a huge danger to road safety.\n\nPutting the speed up to 100kph - roughly 62 mph for 7.5 tonne (small lorries), this will free up the inside lane, and preventing a roads from being hit with this new law.",
