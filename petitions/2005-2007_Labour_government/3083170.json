            "background": "ID cards will cost a fortune and will not prevent terrorism or other crime. They will introduce a new one-stop method of 'identity theft', and will inevitably become compulsory. ID cards and the associated national identity register will increase the power of this and all future governments to keep tabs on and wield arbitrary power over ordinary citizens. We demand proper policies to deal with crime and the causes of crime. We reject this pet project, which may sound good in the headlines but in reality will reduce our liberty for the sole benefit of the nanny state. We do not answer to the government - it answers to us.",
