            "background": "Raising the driving age to 18 or (Heaven forbid!) 20 is totally unfair and discrimanative to teenage drivers. Driving is such an invaluable ability to everyone, regardless of their age and many young people who want to drive will have a fundemental right taken away from them. Young drivers do not cause all road accidents. In places like Alabama and New Zealand, people can drive at 16 and we don't hear stories of crashes caused by young drivers every week! I urge the Prime Minister to rethink his plans on raising the driving age and treat all drives equally, not discriminate them on the basis of their age, or even lower is to 16!",
