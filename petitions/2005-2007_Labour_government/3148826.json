            "background": "There is no consistency between councils that collect recyclable household waste. In my area I can not recycle cardboard or plastic. In other areas they can. Similarly, I am charged for my garden waste disposal. If we are to become a recycling nation then ALL recyclable waste should be collected by councils from our front doors. This is the only way that we can reduce how much of our waste is dumped into land fills.",
