            "background": "The current health warnings do not work. They describe future events and the average smoker can easily disregard these. We believe the direction for these warnings should change. They should focus on the embarrassment of being and smoker; controlled by a substance (and possibly and industry ;-) ) and, importantly the selfishness of being a smoker. All should be backed up with examples the smoker can see or identify with as they smoke today. People are not stupid and along with this proposed new type of warning we believe there is a place for a paragraph of proper scientific explanation on the action of nicotine and the way it works on the brain with particular emphasis on how it robs a smoker of the ability to deal with things non-smokers can deal with, with no problems. The existing warnings (but written in such a way they cannot be easily discarded e.g. no more use of the word \"may\" etc) should be included as a matter of course as small print.",
