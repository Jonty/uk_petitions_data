We, the undersigned, believe that we have enough bad luck in this country, with not only the threat to new road charges but inheritance tax and stealth taxes/controlling policies created by this government on its people.  We believe that not only should cats be banned from crossing roads but also that it should be compulsory that all black cats are made to wear high visability vests to halt this run of bad luck we are having!",
