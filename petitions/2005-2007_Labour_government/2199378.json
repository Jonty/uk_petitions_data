            "background": "..to permit free choice to qualified riders or those over a certain age.The compulsory requirement to wear helmets was introduced in 1973 when an estimated 88% of bikers were wearing helmets voluntarily. By forcing the remaining 12% of riders to wear helmets at all times it was anticipated that a saving of some 300 lives per year would be made. That expectation was never realised. The helmet law as it stands is a disgraceful and unsustainable anomaly in a supposedly free society. Many bikers declare their enthusiasm for helmets on the grounds that they FEEL safer in one. Feeling safe is the most dangerous sensation any road user can experience. \nTo force people to take precautions for their own safety when the neglect to do so poses no threat to others is incompatible with the spirit of a free society. \nIt is hypocritical for a government to victimise bikers in this way when others whose indulgences indisputably represent a huge public burden are permitted free choice.",
