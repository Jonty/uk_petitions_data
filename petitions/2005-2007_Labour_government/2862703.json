            "background": "Evidence is being found on a regular basis that mercury is released from dental fillings during chewing, drinking and to a lesser degree during breathing.   Mercury is a very toxic substance and it has been implicated in the cause of Arthritis, Lupus, MS, ME, Dementia (PSP, Alzheimer's & Parkinsons).   No suitable treatment is available for these conditions and many other countries have already banned its use to improve the health of their citizens.  Cremation of bodies with amalgam fillings damages the environment.",
