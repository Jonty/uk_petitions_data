            "background": "Dental care is prohibitively expensive for many and access to NHS dentists is a rare luxury.  Most dentists are now a money making enterprise and there is no control to stop them upselling treatment that is not needed.  The Government should set up very large regional NHS dental 'hubs' to deal with high volume check ups and routine dental work.  The regional NHS centre would provide a recommendation based on necessity for more extensive dental work, such as cosmetic or specialist care and identify which private practices are best suited to undertake this work.",
