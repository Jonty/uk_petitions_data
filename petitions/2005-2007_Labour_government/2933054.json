A law abiding person should not have to be ounished for being forced to defend themselves, their family nor their property. A rule of \"contributory negligence\" should be applied. If an offender chooses to commit an offence and is then injured during the commission of it, it should be upon their own head. If a victim defends themselves/their property against agression or vandalisom, they should be able to do so without the fear of the miscreant seeking damages.",
