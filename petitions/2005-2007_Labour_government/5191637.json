            "background": "The United States of America has announced plans for a missile shield covering much of Europe from the possibility of nuclear attack. In response the Russian president has begun to test missiles again,, and has threatened to target its nuclear missiles at Europe for the first time since the cold war. We petition the British government to distance itself from this missile shield. Given that missile shieldds are an imprecise technology without 100% garuntee of safety, it is clearly more of a threat than a protection for Britain to be a member of a shield which will in itself antagonise Russia and raise the threat of nuclear conflict or a new cold war.",
