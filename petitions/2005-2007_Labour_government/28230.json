        "background": "The Government's Sustainable Development Commission has concluded that the UK can meet its energy needs by investing relatively modestly in renewable energy projects, such as:\n\nOffshore wind farms;\nSolar energy plants;\nElectric car battery exchange networks.\n\nThere are many more but the Government backs away from them and fosters the further development of dangerous nuclear reactors while retaining the doomed fossil fuel plants which destroy the ecology and exacerbate \"global warming\".\n\nThe current \"Green\" policies of the major parties are tax-tinkering and pandering to the existing energy oligarchy of BP, Shell, Exxon and the nuclear lobby.  The Planet meanwhile disintegrates.",
