            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I beleive that by abolishing speed limits on motorways and duel carriageways these roads will become safer. The Autobahns in Germany are among the least congested and safest roads in Europe with a very heavy flow of traffic. Drivers are more likely to concentrate on their driving if they are travelling at high speed. Also the MOT laws should be made more stringent similar to those in Germany to make vehicles safer.\n\nA modern car can stop safely from well in excess of 100mph looking at the technology which has gone into producing modern braking systems, A far cry from the wire wheels and drum brakes which were in operation when the speed limit was firs introduced.",
