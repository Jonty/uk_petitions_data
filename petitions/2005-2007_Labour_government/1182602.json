        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "ALL the government's initiatives to curb public drunken disorder have failed totally. The new drinking hours have made things worse, not better. It is time to put the public first and not the offender. This is no time to be PC!!!\n\nDecent people can't go out on a friday night and this is the governments responsibility to fix. Citizens have a right to enter all public places and should not be afraid to do so! This fear is fuelled by people who are drunk and violent whilst drunk. \n\nWe call on the PM to introduce a law in parliament that would ban a person who has a history of violence in public whilst drunk from going out to bars and pubs and town centres for 3 months for a first offense, 1 year for a second and lifetime for a third! People who break their ban would be imprisoned!\n\nBritain's reputation internationally is a joke because of this and we are the most violent society regarding drunkeness in the Western world.\n\nPrime Minister, please ACTUALLY do something about it.",
