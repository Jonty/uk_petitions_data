            "background": "Recently Heinz decided to close the HP Sauce factory in Birmingham and move production to Holland. Heinz still wishes to promote HP's 'British ness' in its marketing campaign. \n\nHP has been an iconic brand in the UK for over 100 years and its factory has not only featured as part of the Birmingham Skyscape for many a year, but the smell has filled the air around Aston and will be missed. \n\nCampaigning to keep manufacture in the UK is pointless when the lock the gates for good later this week.\n\nNow we need to concentrate our efforts on removing the image of the Houses of Parliament from the label, I am sure Heinz can use a windmill and still have the same sales\u2026 then request that the royal crest be removed from this Heinz brand. I also suggest that the houses of parliament \u2018logo\u2019 be transferred to Branston for its Brown sauce label.",
