An event too important to be left branded with the current logo, one that is not one that the majority of British people can \"own\" as theirs. We are after all the one's paying for this event, and have a right to expect a 'branding' with which we can be proud to be associated. Therefore we urge the Prime Minister to ask the Olympic committee to drop use of the current inappropriate logo and permit the British public to vote, from a short list, the logo that they consider would best represent their 2012 Olympics.",
