        "background": "New EU legislation would mean that the emissions from new cars sold in 2012 would emit no more than 120g of CO2 per kilometer. Why this big push, I know it's a big part of other countries economies, but the manufacuring process of each new car consumes MORE ENERGY than that car will ever use in its lifetime, get that. It would be far more economic and beneficial to the environment to keep older cars on the road and increase new car sales tax by 500%, this would enable the car industry we have, mainly in parts manufacuring to expand and develop.",
