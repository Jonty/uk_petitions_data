        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is felt by many in the town that the current borough council is simply not up to the job. The latest announcement that it is going to close public toilets in the town as well as cutting the street cleansing budget by \u00a3150,000 amongst other cuts to public services are just the latest in a long line of knocks the people of Northampton have taken from the council. Others include the Weedon Road & Cock Hotel Junction replanning disasters, the long running Sixfields District Centre problem (ironically one of the plans put forward would give the council somewhere in the region of \u00a33m, enough to cover the \u00a33.1m gap in the budget) & being ranked \"worst in the country\" by local government minister, Phil Woolas. \n\nIt's simple. They have to go.",
