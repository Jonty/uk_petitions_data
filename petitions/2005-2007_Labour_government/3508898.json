            "background": "The current 8 minute response time for all Ambulance services is really just a target to reach, and under the current pressures of the over usage of the ever increasing 999 call system, services throughout the country are finding it very difficult to acheive the times. At the moment all that services are concentrating on is time and NOT patient care. The current system needs to change, and it should be the care that the patient received that should be measured on first contact with the various services.",
