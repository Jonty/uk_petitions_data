            "background": "immigration is growing out of control from european countries in to Britain. The large influx of foreign workers sharing accommodation and working for low pay is resulting in big corporations closing down older warehouses on favourable rates of pay and conditions and opening up newer ones on lesser terms and rates. This is forcing the British family worker out of well paid jobs and in to lower standards of living...eroding many years of hard work to create the standards they have lost.\nSchools, Dentists, Hospitals are bulging under the pressures of extra population which in turn lowers standards due to large numbers of inflow.\nCrime is increasing where knives and guns are becoming a way of life due to the lower tolerance from some eastern european counterparts and their (now British) citizens.\n\nWe need to cut immigration right back right now before the country we live in loses its identity and before the British family worker is forced in to lower paid jobs where he can not compete with the cheaper labour.",
