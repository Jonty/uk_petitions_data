            "background": "under the current system any student entering higher education has their financial situation assessed, grants and non repayable lones are handed out to the whose who qualify. the financial assessment dose not ask for enough information to be fair. for instance it dose not consider mortgage amount, the current financial dependability of dependents (other children at uni ext) or any other mitigating factors. if a student dose not qualify for such a grant then they automatically fail to qualify for any burserys that the university may offer. this leaves a grate many students who narrowly missed qualifying for the grant in dire straits while there less well off colleagues are given up to \u00a3900 a semester, plus equipment grants and several other avenues of government money as income. i do not suggest that this money should be stopped, but mealy that a more realistic system be put in place to stop those who's parents income falls just above the cut off point getting a raw deal.",
