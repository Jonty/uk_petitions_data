        "background": "The current system is totally flawed and unfair. All (or those who actually pay it) are charged the same fee, no matter how far they drive. Why should some one who drives 6000miles per year pay the same as someone who drives 20,000 miles. Also it cannot be dodged, if you drive you need fuel, buy fuel pay road tax, simple! The revenue increase would be massive, and also remove the need for this rediculous road tolls idea.",
