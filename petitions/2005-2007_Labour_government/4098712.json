            "background": "More and more towns and cities have the electronic boards that measure your speed and display the current limit in large red led's if you are exceeding the limit. These seems to be fairly low cost going by the number of them popping up, so if they are a low cost option why does every fixed camera site not have one placed say 100yards before the camera itself? If this lowers the drivers speed surely it suceeds if the driver ignores the large led displaying the speed limit by all means the camera should catch the offender. But on the other hand if a driver takes the advice of the led board he/she can pass the camera and hence area at risk at a safer speed and without penalty, and who knows possabily rebuild the tattered relationship with the motoring public!",
