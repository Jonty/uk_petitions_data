            "background": "Clinics are needed on the NHS for fibromyalgia syndrome for diagnosis, treatment and medication.  The medical profession need educating about this condition which affects 5% of the population and their families.  The clinic can run alongside ME clinics as the debilating condition is identical but more pain is present.  Drs should be trained to identify FMS at an early stage as some patients have to wait 20 years to get this.  A simple programme can be used for diagnosis as symptoms vary from patient to patient.  Most are unable to work due to FMS and help is needed for this also as treatments are expensive and unaffordable to most patients, therefore the NHS which we have all paid into could be in place nationwide, not just privately or in London but locally.\n\nWHEN IN RECOVERY PATIENTS WILL BE ABLE TO WORK INSTEAD OF BEING A BURDEN TO THE NHS BUT NEED THIS HELP TO GET THERE.",
