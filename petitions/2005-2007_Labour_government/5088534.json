            "background": "Tax collection in this country comes from so many varied sources that it is neither transparent nor efficiently collected.  \n\nHuge amounts of money are spent by the government and industry in administering the collection of tax.\n\nIt would be financially advantageous and make it more clear for people, if the process were streamlined.  Clearly, the division of tax so that people that, for instance use cars, pay tax that can then be used to maintain and devleop the road infrastructure makes sense but this type of taxation should be the exception, not the rule.  \n\nIf anything with, for example proposed taxation calculated by road use, we are to be increasing the complexity of tax calculations and collection rather than making it more straightforward.  \n\nThis complexity carries huge, unnecessary administrative overheads.",
