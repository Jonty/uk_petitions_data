            "background": "After doing a GCSE Geography lesson on Development and especially on the country of Malawi in Africa the Comic Relief campaign was brought up. Upon reading the website details of how much they had made were shown. Since 1985 they had made about \u00a3400million. This in my opinion is not very good. The UK has about 60million people in it and about 50 million of these are old enough to understand where the aid goes to and what it does. \nIf each of these 50 million people had to automatically give \u00a31 per month then a total of up to \u00a3600million pounds would be made per year. this is would already be more than comic relief has made in over 20 years. This would be given as aid to poorer countries in the world such as Malawi. \nPeople who had an income would automatically have to give the money to the government and this would be withdrawn from their bank account every month. The government itself should not spend the money but give it to charities to do with it what they will.",
