            "background": "Mr Blair, as your government is keen to promote responsible environmental policies, we would ask that serious consideration be given by the government to ways of curtailing the operations of Richard Branson's company, Virgin Galactic.\nBranson's company has a target of ferrying 50,000 people into low Earth orbit over the next 12 years. This requires a minimum 8,333 flights. These flights will inevitably spew many thousands of tons of environmentally damaging Carbon Dioxide into the atmosphere.  \nMr Branson, in conjunction with former Vice President, Al Gore, has recently offered a prize of $25,000,000 to the individual who comes up with the best plan to significantly reduce CO2 emissions. \nIf your government was to propose to parliament a purposely very high level of tax on Virgin Galactic and their prospective passengers; this measure might be enough to compel them to cease their activities which amount to environmental vandalism and globally affect all 7 billion of us on planet Earth.",
