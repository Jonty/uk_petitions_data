        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently when people in financial difficulty or those in part time employment need to get a second job to provide for themselves and their family the tax rate - even when earning below the lower earnings threshold - for that job is set at Basic Rate 22%. Considering that in most cases those people are part time cleaners, carers etc i.e. on low wages (often minimum wage) this is an absurd amount of tax for them to be paying. I would like the amount of tax employees pay from their multiple jobs to be based on the amount they earn per hour, NOT standard basic rate.",
