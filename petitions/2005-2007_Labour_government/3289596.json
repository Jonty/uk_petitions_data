            "background": "By the point at which any embryo might be used in medical research it will already have been aborted; it can't develop into a person so it might as well be used to benefit people who already exist. (Embryos or foetuses are not \"unborn children\"; they are only unborn POTENTIAL children since they could be miscarried or stillborn).  Stem cells etc., if allowed to be used, could alleviate, or even cure, distressing conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinsons's etc.; isn't that worth doing?  If the opponents of this suffered from such conditions would they continue to suffer rather than benefit from stem cells?  Even if THEY THEMSELVES would they have no right to deny the benefits of these to others.",
