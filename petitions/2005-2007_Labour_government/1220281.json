            "background": "Once a person reaches 65 the gas and electricity supplies should be provided to them free of charge. The energy companies make huge profits from their sales of these essential services and having paid for them all their lives pensioners should receive them free from aged 65 onwards. This would mean that the government would not have to give out the winter supplements to them and that money could then be reinvested back into health and welfare or educational services.",
