The lack of any rigorous evidence to support the government's current policy (and the opposition's policy as well) does not give the government any basis for their expenditure and control of behaviour through taxation and regulation. We the undersigned petition the prime minister to look again at the evidence and explain why the current policies should persist and if the evidence suggests that they shouldn't, to announce as such and cease.",
