Sometimes they find themselves in unusual or interesting situations that others are interested to learn about. We should not deny their liberty, and we should allow them to tell (publish and sell) their personal stories.\n\nThe great British poets Wilfred Owen MC and Siegfried Sassoon CBE MC were solders who wrote first hand accounts of their experiences of war. Military accounts, memoirs and fiction have been published for generations.\n\nPublishing or selling a story is merely taking part in a free society with a free press. This issue should not to be confused with health care or other unrelated military issues.",
