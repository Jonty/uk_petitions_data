If you don't give us a good reason to change, if it takes longer or isn\u2019t any cheaper, we won\u2019t change. We want to know, what's in it for us? If I took public transport to work it would take over an hour & cost me \u00a34 a day instead of 15 mins by car for a few pence, so I take my car! Parents drop their kids to school en-route to work or because it's quicker and safer, or just out of habit. How about this? As well as free use of regular bus services a School Shuttles in towns/cities. Take kids to pick-up points & know that they will be safely dropped at school & the same going home. What about tax incentives to companies that lay on staff buses at peak times? Dropped at the office door for say \u00a31 each way? Make buses more energy efficient while your at it too! They're hardly environmentally friendly! Each bus on the road takes more cars off the road. If yr a student who wants free travel for students go to: http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/passes/.",
