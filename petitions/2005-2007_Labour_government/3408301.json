            "background": "I am fed up with the government doing nothing with about enforcing competition laws in this country.  In particular with regards the power that Richard Murdoch and the large super market chains continue to enjoy.  The government is too frightened to annoy the businesses that are destroying the character of this country.  I petition that the government intervene and reduce the power that these large conglomerates create so that the everyday consumer can get a better deal without destroying other industries i.e. farming",
