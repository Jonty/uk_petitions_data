And to show the people that attend the same respect on a joyous occasion Litha the summer solstice.\nStonehenge wasn't built as a museum. It was built as place for people to come, for worship, to use it.\nAt the same token the behavior of people who freely drink to excess so they can not even walk,are abusive to others,and openly take drugs... Are ruining the atmosphere for people who truly wish to be here to mark this very special occasion.\n\nWe wish for things to change and for fellow spiritual people who will not attend due to party goers to return\n\nWe want Stonehenge to be returned to the people who wish to worship  their deities there and not use the stones as a nightclub.\nThat way our sacred monument will be safe for thousands of years to come.",
