        "background": "Every year, over a million children are trafficked into the modern-day equivalent of slavery. They are secretly transported across borders and sold like commodities or trafficked within countries for the sole purpose of exploitation. It is a crime that violates the basic rights of children, a crime which can - and does - destroy lives.\n\nIn the uk large brothels,many run by large criminal gangs operate openly, freely and more importantly illegally, All with permission from local councils and the police.\n\nThese brothels do nothing but harm they encourage men to enter this world and add to the already huge market of paid for sex. Its time the prime minister stood by his words and did something to impact this vile trade.",
