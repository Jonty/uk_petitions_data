            "background": "THE SEXUAL ORIENTATION REGULATIONS\nUsing power they gave to themselves through the Equality Act 2006, which will FORCE YOU to accept gay sex education for your children and will likely criminalise you if you ever say anything that a homosexual feels is insulting. If you are FED UP of being insulted by homosexuals as being \"homophobic,\" \"bigoted,\" and equivalent to a racist, just because you don't agree that children should be taught about gay sex and relationships. Christians desire the repentance and salvation of homosexuals would never want to be homophobic or discriminate against homosexuals out of bigotry or prejudice. The Bible is clear that the only rightful sexual relationship for which we were created, is a relationship between a man and a woman in the context of a legitimate marriage. Consequently there are times when Christians need to be free to discriminate against homosexuals in order to make it clear that we believe in the Bible's teaching that homosexual practice is wrong. Shield our children and protect the freedom of conscience for Christian, Jews and Muslims, whilst they go about their everyday lives, \n then sign this Petition.",
