        "background": "Private sector workers earn the money that allows this country to function, yet they share road congestion with the public sector, pensioners and school run parents, along with others, costing the economy billions of pounds each year.  The government needs to work on a plan to allow private sector workers the ability to travel to and from work without being obstructed by other road users.  This plan should include either reduced or tax free travel, as the Private Sector already pays for the running of the country and all these other road users. \n\nThe plan could include high road charges for non Private Sector travellers, thus including the current governments plan to introduce road charging whilst, keeping the highways clear for the real money earners of this country.",
