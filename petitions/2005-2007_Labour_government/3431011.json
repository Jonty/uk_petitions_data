            "background": "Farm vehicles that use A roads cause congestion due to their slowness, and are a danger to other A road users because people either try to overtake them at inappropriate places due to frustration, or don't realise how slowly the vehicle is travelling (especially on dual carriageways) and pull out to overtake into the path of other vehicles or else run into the back of the farm vehicle. Such vehicles are built for fields and not public highways, but are often driven on busy public roads simply to prevent field gates from becoming boggy.",
