        "background": "The drug, Exubera, is designed to offer adults with diabetes an alternative to their daily insulin injections. Exubera for Type 1 and 2 diabetes costs \u00a31,100 per person per year but patients would still need injections at night. The inhaled insulin is the first non-injected option for insulin therapy. During clinical trials, researchers found inhaled insulin was as effective as injections in controlling blood sugar levels. The drug has already been given approval by the European licensing body, but the NICE was testing it on cost-effectiveness grounds for England and Wales. Diabetes UK said the inhaler was a medical breakthrough should not be restricted on the basis of cost. There is an urgent need for more research to support the improvements made by using inhaled insulin on quality of life. Manufacturers Pfizer said: NICE has dismissed the robust scientific and medical evidence used by international medical experts in the US and Europe to grant widespread approval for this medicine. The choice here is quite simple: force patients to keep enduring the burden of multiple daily injections and poor compliance, as they have since the 1920s, or give them an alternative.",
