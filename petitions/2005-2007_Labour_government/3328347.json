            "background": "The Treasury has profited by over \u00a3250,000 from the sale of the remarkably popular \"Janet & John\" CD's, as recorded by the old codger Terry Wogan and his sidekick, the remarkably elegant John Marsh. It is very wrong that money which could be used for the many worthy causes supported by \"Children in Need\" should instead be diverted to the coffers of Gordon Brown as taxation. The efforts of the brave team in Newport S.Wales to sell and distribute this wonderful product deserves better. The Prime Minister is himself rapidly approaching \"TOG-dom\" and may be glad of a little cheer in his twilight years, and should therefore support this petition himself.",
