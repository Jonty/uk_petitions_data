            "background": "Recent months have seen more evidence accrue in favour of the health benefits of circumcision, which is best performed neonatally.  However, unlike in countries such as the USA, there is a complete lack of adequate provision for circumcision in NHS maternity hospitals and units, except in a few areas which cater to sizable Muslim populations.\nCircumcision reduces the risk of HIV infection by over 50%, the risk of urinary tract infections by a factor of 12, penile cancer by a factor of 22, prostate cancer by 50%, and also cervical cancer in partners.\nCurrent policy and provision should be amended to reflect the scientific evidence, and this option should be made available for all new parents.",
