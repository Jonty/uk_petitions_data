        "action": "Raise the legal drinking age to 21",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Britain is currently addressing a serious issue of binge drinking throughout the UK. The consequences of binge drinking are increased violence, disturbances and the cost of extra policing in towns and citys.\nThe youth of today see alcohol as an attractive proposition. However many are too immature to see it's consequences. We have issues where large groups of youths (14-18 years old) terrorise local villages and shops fuelled by alcohol. We should be ashamed of our booze culture and how we are portrayed across the world, this is down to our up bringing. Students continue moaning about the debts when they leave university, but the truth is that they have abused their situation with many nights out drinking and the cost of supporting this lifestyle with loans and grants. The solution to this is increasing the drinking age to 21,  Sign this petition and lets make a start in changing our culture.",
