        "action": "Reduce VAT to 5% on repairs, alterations and extensions to all buildings and increase VAT on new houses from 0-5%.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The present 17.5% rate of VAT charged on all building works encourages cowboy builders and a black \"cash\" economy which has been totally under estimated by government. It also discourages the renovation of derelict empty houses and the refurbishment of listed buildings and churches. Legitimate construction firms who charge VAT are disadvantaged by this present system. Other countries such as France have demonstrated that by reducing VAT the tax revenue can actually be increased because homeowners have little incentive to pay cash to cowboy builders for building work.  It would also help to improve the availability of houses thus reduce the need to build in the green belt. The quality of workmanship would also improve benefiting the general public.",
