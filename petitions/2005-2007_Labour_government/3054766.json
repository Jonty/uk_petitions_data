            "background": "If the web site at the Prime Minister's office is so busy why in this age of superfast computers do they not have the capability of registering the odd million or so people who wish to question the way we are governed. We sign up for the petition then when we try to confirm the vote all that happens is a message saying \" We are very busy at the moment and try again later\". How many people remember to do that?? I think the PM's office should accept our vote and when it is officially accepted on the Register(however long that may take)we receive a reply telling us our vote is registered OR a message saying your vote did not register please try now. The worrying part about all this is why so many people feel the need to petition the PM about these matters.",
