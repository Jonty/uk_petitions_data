We are not liked or respected by other nations who go out of there way to make that clear. Why then do we continue to let our country become eroded of its independence. Norway and Switzerland have not needed EU membership to support strong economies so why should we? We are being fooled into beleiving that we are benefiting from membership to an ever expanding union of nations who are only ever going to look out for there own interests. We CAN and WILL survive and thrive as a nation allowed to make our own decisions.",
