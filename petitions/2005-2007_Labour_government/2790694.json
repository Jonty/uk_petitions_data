            "background": "1. A fairly priced and standardised price structure across the country to help improve choices for the travelling public.\n\n2. Public transport should be about quality of service not financial profit therefore all public transport should be government operated. \n\n3. The infrastructure can not sustain the current increase in demand therefore needs substantial investment to improve, upgrade and meet public expectations.\n\n4. Above all we need an integrated (road, rail, air,water and 'green')transport strategy in both the short and long term.  e.g. road user charging does not address the underlying issues only a superficial fix.",
