            "background": "We want to ask the Prime Minister to raise awareness of the issues of Environmental and ethical damages caused by today's meat industry. Some of these issues include land usage, waste, keeping conditions and the problem of  inhumane treatment of animals. There are currently very little effective measures to ensure the humane treatment of animals in the meat industry. The very ignorance of pain and suffering itself is inhumane. \n\nI am asking for as many people as possible to help stop the cruelty hidden behind the walls of Slaughterhouses and meat factories by signing this petition to demand the Prime Minister to enforce measures to prevent stresses on the environment the meat industry creates.",
