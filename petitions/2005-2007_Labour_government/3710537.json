Service length should be a minimum of 3 years and a maximum of 5 years. A choice of which service to serve in should be given with no interference by Government or any other body. If armed forces are deployed, National Service personal should be used to replace the regular army in areas that are not considered hostile. Pay should be inline with current miltary pay structures.",
