        "background": "Much of the congestion problem on motorways is caused by HGV's in effect reducing the road to one lane. There should be a HGV ban from 0730-0900 and 1630-1800. This would require the building of motorway parking areas but would elivate much of the traffic congestion and not cost the hard pressed motorist a penny.",
