            "background": "The creator of this petition says that this is taught to children \"as young as 4\"; unless you believe that children of that age are too young for any sort of sex education why are they considered too young for non-heterosexual education?  The petition also says that parents should have the right to decide what their children are taught but children have no control over who their parents are or what their parents believe so this would mean that the parents' views would be handed on to the children; I feel it is very important for schools to be able to counteract this.",
