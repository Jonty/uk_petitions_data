        "background": "Quiz TV Programmes cost \u00a30.75-\u00a31.50 to enter, and offer cash prizes up to \u00a350,000. Such programmes attract the less well-off to win such prizes, whilst actually cause the vast majority to lose money in increasing phone bills. Following recent legislation, it is now law for such shows to display the number of callers attempting to access the studio per minute. This figure is often upwards of 1000 calls.\n\nThis is exploitation and should not be allowed. I therefore call for a national ban on such broadcasts.",
