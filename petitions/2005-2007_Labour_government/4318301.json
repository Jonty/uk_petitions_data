            "background": "At present, Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs describe renting property as 'running a rental business' and tax the business on normal business principles. However, when such a property is sold, it is not classed as a qualifying business asset for CGT taper relief purposes, but is subjected to the much more onerous private assets taper relief.\nIn the interests of fairness, and promoting the much-needed private rental sector, the playing field should be levelled. This will benefit private initiative, and promote the longterm rental needs to the tenant community",
