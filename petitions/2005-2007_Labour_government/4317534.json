And there are many individuals like this, who believe this is ok, and have no regard for the law.\nThis is widespread and is not just limited to a few communities. \nLets stop the war here, bring peace back home, and return the idealogy that the law, justice and and  the scales that this great nation was built on, will return.\nWe cannot go-on trying to fix and help others,(with the media concentrating on Iraq, Afghanistan), when we have so many problems of our own!!\nSTOP THE ROT, START AT HOME.",
