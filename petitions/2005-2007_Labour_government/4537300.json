            "background": "BSI, a world class standards organisation, are involved in the process of approving international ISO/OSI standards. Their work is accomplished by committees of experts. ISO have approved a document format ISO 26300 for office documentation and other uses, which is an open standard and provides significant tangible benefit to the world, particularly for long term document archival, as it is not dependent on any one manufacturer. Microsoft have proposed an alternative standard, which if approved, may conflict with the ISO rules (there should only be one for a given type of item). The Microsoft standard is considered the experts who have examined it to be  defective in many respects, overly complex, incomplete, and cannot be implemented by third parties. Microsoft have created a petition to obtain signatures from  members of the public, who are unlikely to be experts in the field, to apply pressure to BSI to support their standard. The independence and credibility of BSI are important, and they should mot be subjected to pressure in this way as it may do lasting harm to their reputation and consequently UK industry.",
