            "background": "Gordon Brown abolished ACT in his 1997 budget. This allowed pension funds to  claim back the tax on dividends from companies in which they owned shares. He has taken \u00a35 billion-a-year from this action. This reduces the amount of money in the fund when an annuity is purchased to fund retirement. This action is at odds with Mr. Brown's encouragement of saving for retirement and hence this tax   should be scrapped to provide an incentive.",
