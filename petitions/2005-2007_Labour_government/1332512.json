            "background": "Sexual orientation legislation is designed to protect the LGB community from unfair discrimination. However it threatens to create discrimination against large numbers of people who hold strong views of a religious and/or psycho-social nature on this deeply felt and contentious subject.\n\nRegardless of how much this government might want to protect a minority group it must take into account that the interests of this group conflict in certain ways with the interests of other minority groups.  The government should not seek to uphold one at the expense of the others.  It must seek to deal fairly with all.\n\nFurthermore, we the undersigned believe that a government that seeks to coerce its citizens to act against their conscience in matters of faith is open to the charge of being morally corrupt. We trust that this government will show by its actions that such a charge is unfounded, and amend the legislation to take into account the needs and strongly held views of all parties involved.",
