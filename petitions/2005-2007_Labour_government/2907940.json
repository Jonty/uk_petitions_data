They should be housed in alternate way. There is not a lot to say on this, we are either a barbaric people or we are not, which is it.\nprison or an adult mental hospital is no place for a child. Has Charles Dickens taugt us nothing. It has already been decided that Britain is a sad place in which to bring up a child. When compared with the rest of Europe. We are either going to have compassion or we are not, which is it? If you do not agree with this petition, then there is no hope for the future. For the children are our future. They should not be a persecuted, disregarded section of society.",
