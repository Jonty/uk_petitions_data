On top of that the cultural, and in particular, religous differences create a divide that will always be too big to bridge.  The US wants this because it wants to keep US bases in Turkey, and the UK wants this as we are a US poodle, and to dilute the EU into a trading block rather than a large nation state. And anyway Europe has enough seriously dissaffected muslims without taking in another 60 million",
