            "background": "Imposing individual speed limits for each lane of the motorway, with both a minimum and maximum restriction staggered from the slow lane to the fast lane, would improve the flow of traffic by preventing slow vehicles from holding up faster traffic and by allowing faster vehicles to complete their journey in shorter time, thus reducing the number of vehicles on the roads.  This would be particularly prevalent if the outer lane had no upper speed limit as seen in Germany.",
