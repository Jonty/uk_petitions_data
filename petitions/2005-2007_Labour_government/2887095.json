            "background": "British schools no longer care if the children get good grades or not.  The government should up the standards of all schools in the south east of england. My 3 daughters all attend schools in Gravesend, Kent and they are allowed to do what they want when they want during school time, they are not learning much, and are not likely to get decent jobs when they leave because the schools they attend just don't care.  If i could afford a private school that is where they would go because they are the only schools these days that actually teach children anything.  The government say they want to get people into work well teach our children right so they will have the qualifications needed to be able to go out and work in a few years time.",
