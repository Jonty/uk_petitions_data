It won't save energy at all it will still be dark for the same ammount of time it alwyas is , street lights will still be on for the same time.Why do we need lighter nights ? its light till 10;30 in the summer, thats long enough,is the govenment going to supply blackout blinds for our childrens bedrooms?
