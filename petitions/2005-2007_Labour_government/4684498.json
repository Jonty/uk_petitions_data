            "background": "Why should anyone be allowed to carry knives in a public place. By public place i mean street, park, pub or club. No one needs to carry these items at all. I have had to pay over \u00a3300 to the SIA just to be able to work, and the amount of personal safety equipment we need is getting more and more. Stabvests are now a definate requirement.I work as a Door Supervisor and have had occasions where knives have been found whilst people were being searched upon entry to a nightclub. They should be prepared to go to prison just for possession of these items. Please help and sign this petition.",
