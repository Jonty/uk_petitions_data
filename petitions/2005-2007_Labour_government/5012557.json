            "background": "The existing system by which credit reference agencies operate is heavily weighted towards the credit reference agencies at the expense of consumers.\n\nCredit reference agencies are able to publish incorrect information concerning individuals, but they do not automatically suffer a financial penalty or other regulatory action as a result of such damaging errors. Stringent fines and other penalties should be applied to those firms that act in such a cavalier manner with people's lives.\n\nAlso, firms should be legally obliged to inform customers of their intention to enter adverse data on a credit file, to allow such information to be challenged. At the moment, the only way of checking whether or not credit reference agencies have entered adverse and incorrect information is to request a statutory report, which costs \u00a32 and takes up to 7 days to obtain. This service should be free.",
