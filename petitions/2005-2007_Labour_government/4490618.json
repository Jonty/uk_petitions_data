            "background": "Currently peace talks between the government and LRA are underway in Juba, Sudan.  Optimism over the peace talks is tempered by an ever-present concern for the plight of the civilian population of northern Uganda, being held hostage by the Government of President Yoweri Museveni in concentration camps in northern Uganda.\n\nDriven into the camps by the government army the UPDF, residents of the \"protected villages\" (concentration camps) continue to die at the rate 2500 per week, from HIV/AIDS, Malaria, Menengistis, other curable diseases and the very diplorable conditions in which they are being forced to live, resulting in rsuicide rates of up to 3-5 daily.  \n\nWhile the world focuses it attention on Juba, the genocide project continues unabated in the form of the concentration camps.  I therefore implore The Prime Minister to play a more assertive role in ending this human destruction and promoting conflict resolution, democratic pluralism, and respect for human rights in Uganda.",
