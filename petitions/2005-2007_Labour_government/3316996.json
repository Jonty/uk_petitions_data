            "background": "For the second week in a row my black bin has not been taken as it contains waste that could be recycled. I understand the advantages of recycling but i simply dont have the time to do this. I also believe it is not the law to recycle so my waste should not be rejected. What is happening is a breech of my human rights - to recycle or not. As i am paying them for a service that isn't happening i am prepared to dispose of my waste myself - if my council tax is stopped. I know my neighbours feel the same as me so it is time we all did something about it.",
