Is the BBC seeking a unique English identity, at the expense of others?  News from the \u201cregions\u201d needs to be catastrophic to get mentioned on UK-wide BBC. English sports and teams, even the Cotswold Olympics are shown UK-wide whilst \u201cregional\u201d leagues are almost totally ignored. Sponsorship follows the greater audience and the \u201cregional\u201d sports organisations suffer as a direct result. International matches and competitions are equally biased.  \nPerhaps we should simply accept that BBC actually stands for the Biased Broadcasting Corporation.",
