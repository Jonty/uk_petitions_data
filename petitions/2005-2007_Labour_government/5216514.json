        "background": "Any news or sport that involves England is deemed to be of UK wide interest whilst  \nnews from Wales, Scotland and probably Northern Ireland is only broadcast in the \u201cregion\u201d. Is the BBC seeking a unique English identity, at the expense of others?  News from the \u201cregions\u201d needs to be catastrophic to get mentioned on UK-wide BBC. English sports and teams, even the Cotswold Olympics are shown UK-wide whilst \u201cregional\u201d leagues are almost totally ignored. Sponsorship follows the greater audience and the \u201cregional\u201d sports organisations suffer as a direct result. International matches and competitions are equally biased.  \nPerhaps we should simply accept that BBC actually stands for the Biased Broadcasting Corporation.",
