        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "If a student leaves school or 6th form college and gains employment they earn state pension entitlement for the time they are employed, quite rightly.\nIf a student leaves school or 6th form college and is unable to gain  employment and is in reciept of state benefit (job seekers allowance or equivalent) they are issued with NIC (National Insurance Contribution) credits for the time they are signed on, full time students cannot do this.\nIf a female student leaves school or 6th form college and has a baby and is in reciept of child allowance she receives Home Responsibilities Protection (i.e. NIC credits).\n\nA University student may spend 7 years gaining their qualification, for which they have to pay, and in that time they recieve no NIC Credit whatsoever in recognition of that time and are therefore that amount of time behind their peers.\nWe believe that this is both unfair and unreasonable and that some form of NIC Credit should be made available to them for this period.",
