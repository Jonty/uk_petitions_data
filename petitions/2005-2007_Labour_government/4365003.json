            "background": "Due to pathetic recent form and a shocking display at the previous World Cup in Germany, I wish to petition to have Frank Lampard barred from playing for the English National team. He did not play recently which allowed Steven 'legend' Gerrard to play his game and score two goals giving England a glimmer of glory. Lets move away from embarrassing defeats to the likes of Northern Ireland and recapture some pride in our national game.",
