        "background": "Whilst it is becoming illegal to discriminate on the basis of age, the most blatant discrimination is the automatic 100% increase on travel insurance for people once they reach the age of 65. This group of people have the free time available to take advantage of cheaper off peak holidays but are often deterred because the cost of insurance can be higher than the cost of the holiday. They are unlikely to take part in activities associated with high risk and should not be penalised. This is positive discrimination.",
