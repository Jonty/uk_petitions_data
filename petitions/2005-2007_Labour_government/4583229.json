            "background": "In the year 2007, British Football has become very ill from a disease that has developed over many years. \n\nThe disease I speak of is not hooliganism or corruption, but it the use of gimmicks such as Drums and Music after goals to increase atmosphere in stadiums across the land. \n\nInstead of \"increasing\" atmosphere in stadiums, it subjects the spectator to an Americanised experience that is ruining the unique character of British Football.\n\nI am requesting a ban on such gimmicks, so that we can have our game back once again in the fit and proper state it should be in.",
