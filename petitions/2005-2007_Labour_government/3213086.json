        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Within the next few years the analogue television transmissions will be turned off, which will mean all analogue only televisions will need a decoder. It is rediculous that there are still sets being sold which can only recieve analogue signals. I am proposing there should be legislation in place to force retailers to sell only televisions which can recieve digital or both analogue and digital. This will save people money and protect the environment from the thousands of sets which would otherwise be made useless from being dumped into land fill sites. Not to mention the resources used to produce, sell and transport new set top boxes.",
