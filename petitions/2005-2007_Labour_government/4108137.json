            "background": "The main point of advertising is to increase sales ie flights. And with airports like Heathrow where all the 'landing slots' are full, adverts are used to lure passengers to fly to more distant and exotic destinations. Slots are being gradually traded from short to long haul, further increasing carbon emissions. After that  adverts are used to increase demand and hence prices - without advertising some prices will come down and airlines will be a less attractive area for investors. \n\nWe do not shy away from banning the advertising of social 'bads' such as tobacco and casinos so why do we allow the promotion of the fastest growing contribution to climate change? People can still fly if they want to, if they are prepared to pay the full costs.",
