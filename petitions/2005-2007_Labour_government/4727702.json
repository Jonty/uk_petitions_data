            "background": "When budget is held and car tax is increased, it is with immediate effect.  However, I think if a vechicle owner has already been sent there DVLA (V11), tax reminder, with cost of car tax, that is the cost that should be obided by.  I think its wrong that one cost is sent and then due to budget, this cost is overruled.  Seems to me that DVLA waste time and paper sending this info out.  Its happened to me 3 years running.. I've waited in post office with the exact amount of money for tax (the amount stated on V11 form), then when you get to counter, your told, \"Due to budget, the amount has changed.... your tax has gone up!\"... WRONG... once that DVLA form goes with the total amount for your tax, that should be obided by.",
