            "background": "Too many council's charge a significant amount of money in tax for living in their area, this is fair to some extent for providing us with services for our day to day living, however the cost of council tax should mirror the service provided. Council's should be forced to re-pay a percentage of council tax back to residents if they fail to deliver on agreed key performance indicators (KPI) or forefit any forecasted rises in the tax in the coming years. Council's must be accountable like so many of us are for the services we provide.",
