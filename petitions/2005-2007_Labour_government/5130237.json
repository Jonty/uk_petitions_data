Only 354 were prosecuted for speeding, despite 67,500 of these images showing that the police cars involved did not have blue lights on, i.e. were on \"normal\" duty. The police must be made to adhere to the same rules of the road that applies to all subjects when NOT on pursuit or when attending incidents. This will raise over \u00a34 million in revenue alone and will restore public confidence in a judiciary system that looks increasingly two-tiered.",
