            "background": "Road tax used to have a genuine purpose - to show entitlement to use the vehicle on the public road (ie it was insured and MOT'd). \n\nWith the introduction of computerisation and ANPR there is no need for a tax disc now. (except of course as a revenue raiser). \n\nSORN has no purpose at all. If I want to keep a vehicle off the road, why is it the business of the DVLA? It is only their business if I use a vehicle ON a public road without insurance or MOT.\n\nSo PROVE you're green - Abolish road tax and sorn & get rid of all the admin and paper surrounding this. \n\nAdd the lost revenue to fuel (we won't notice it with the amount you screw out of us already!)",
