        "action": "direct his militiary research facilities to develop low cost hybrid diesel-electric vehicle power units for their fighting vehicles with plans for scaling down for civilian use to give us a 100mpg+ \u00a36,000 car without frills.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "What is needed is a 100mpg+ \u00a36,000 car without  frills. Currently militiary vehicles in war theatres like Iraq and Afghanistan can easily be spotted because of their large carbon footprint (pollution they cause). This is also not good for the locals as we are not trying to kill them all.\nThe military have a huge Research and Development budget.\nThe plan is to get them to develop a diesel electric hybrid that is far more efficient than the Toyota Prius for war use. A tank thus fitted would be harder to find and could outrun the enemy by not having to keep stopping to refuel. The technology would then be transferred to civilian use giving us a much more environmentally friendly and affordable car.",
