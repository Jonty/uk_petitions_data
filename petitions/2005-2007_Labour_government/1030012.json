            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The terminally ill and long term severely disabled people often find it difficult to stay warm during the cold winter period, often due to mobility difficulties. At present the winter fuel allowance is available to any person over the age of 60, regardless of income status. Therefore, by increasing the entry age to 65 for the general public, the Government would free up enough funding to enable them to include the terminally ill and long term severely disabled on the higher components of the Disability Living Allowance in to the Winter Fuel Allowance category.",
