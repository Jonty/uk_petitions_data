            "background": "People day to day are being affected by striking action by various public sector workers and private companies - university lecturer strikes, British Airways threatened strikes, civil service strikes to name a few. This causes disruption to people who have done nothing  to deserve it and is grossly unfair not to mention potentially damaging businesses. There are better democratic means of sorting disputes. We call on the government to make strikes illegal and give employers the right to discipline anyone who strikes as they are effectively taking unauthorised absence from work.",
