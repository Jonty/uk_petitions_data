None, however, deals specifically with Section 28 or, especially, with the issue of \"promotion\" of homosexuality.  My view (as a heterosexual woman) is that homosexuality almost NEEDS to be promoted in order to counteract the all-pervasive, and completely taken for granted, (so much so that you don't even notice it or realise that it's happening) promotion of HETEROSEXUALITY!",
