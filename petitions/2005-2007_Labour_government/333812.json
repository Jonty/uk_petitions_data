Make loud parties after 10pm illegal and punishable by fines of up to \u00a31,000,000. Make anyone doing DIY before 9am and after 9pm dig rocks in quaries as punishment. Noisy dog owners to be placed on a very remote island with their dog. Could noisy neighbours have any noise making implements confiscated. If they keep on being naughty televise their property being demolished whilst they are out. On another note could any ban on Leylandii be extended to include any trees blocking sunlight from a neighbours garden. Could it also be made compulsory for people to come and rake up the leaves from their trees in other peoples gardens and their photo put in the local papers.",
