            "action": "enforce setting electronic ignition systems on all new vehicles limiting maximum speed to 70 mph",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We are told that speed is a major factor in death and injury on British Roads; it is also felt contributes to higher emissions. All car manufactures have the technology to set maximum speeds within their vehicles by setting the \u2018black box\u2019 or ignition electronics.\n\nThe maximum speed limit is 70 mph yet vehicles sold far exceed this. If manufactures governed speed this should see further reductions in death, injury, road racing, emission, fuel consumption and eventual elimination of motorway speeding.\n\nCurrent vehicles with electronic ignition systems could be \u2018chipped\u2019 to govern speed \u2013 at the government / manufactures / owners cost. Tampering with ignition systems would be enforced with large fines, licence points, destruction and recycling of the vehicle, without exception.\n\nHistoric / other vehicles that do not have electronic systems and are found speeding would be subject to the vehicle receiving 'points' despite ownership and destroyed when a set maximum is reached.",
