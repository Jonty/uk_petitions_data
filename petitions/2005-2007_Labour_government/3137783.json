            "background": "Good Friday & Easter Monday are recognised as Bank Holidays. Easter Sunday is not, and although large outlets are not allowed to open for trading, staff are still being made to work or to make up the time in the week. Easter Sunday is as much a part of Easter celebrations (if not more so) than either Friday or Monday! Not everyone works Monday to Friday, many people have weekend working written into their contract. Sunday work for alot of people is just at basic rate. The letter of the law is being obeyed about not trading, but the sprit of the law is being manipulated. Easter Sunday should have all the benefits that B/H working has... extra pay rates or time off in lieu.",
