Some PCT\u2019s accept the clinical judgement of senior  cancer consultants, but other PCT\u2019s force desperately ill patients through a long & complicated exceptional cases/appeals process, then  disregard the clinicians opinion  and refuse to fund the recommended treatment.\n\nThese two drugs are licensed & approved by the European Commission & in the USA as the standard treatment for metastatic RCC. \n It is unacceptable and immoral that British Kidney Cancer patients, who have no other hope, can be denied these drugs and sentenced to a premature death.",
