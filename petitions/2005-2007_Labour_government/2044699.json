        "background": "Sir, Retained fire fighters form the back bone of the UK fire service in fact cover 80% of the uk land mass. Is not time that your government looked at doing something to help employers of these people?\n\nPerhaps a company tax allowance which would cover all special services including \u201cterritorial army, co responders, and retained staff, life boat crews ect\u201d.\n\nIt can be very difficult to get a job when you are a retained fire-fighter as employers are fearful of the additional burdens that come with employing someone that may well run off for up to 4 hours, and as such a tax allowance for them may well help redress the balance whilst recognising the vital work they do.\n\nSir, it\u2019s my belief that the people of the UK would whole heartily support such a measure whilst at the same time you would ensure the services you require for years to come.",
