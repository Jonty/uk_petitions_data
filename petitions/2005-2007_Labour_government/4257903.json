Now it is proposed that the next three submarine names will be 'Audacious', 'Anson' and 'Agamemnon' - famous ship names but previously used on very old battleships - with no connection whatsoever with submarines. The 'old' A class also had the traditional names Amphion, Aeneas, Artemis, Alliance, Affray, Acheron, Alaric, Alcide, Alderney, Anchorite, Andrew, Auriga and Aurochs.",
