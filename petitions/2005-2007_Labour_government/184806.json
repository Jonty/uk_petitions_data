We feel that isolating 4x4 drivers is insighting hatered towards 4x4 owners/drivers. Closing off countryside routes where 4x4's can be used for which they are designed to be used. Everyone has a right to own a 4x4 and since when can the Goverment dictate what car we can drive as we live in a FREE COUNTRY",
