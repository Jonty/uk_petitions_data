        "background": "The Civil Protection symbol of an orange triangle on a blue background disk surround by the EU Stars was adopted by all member states yet is not visible in the UK. Citzens of the EU are highly mobile and when they travel they should be able to immediately recognise the infrastructure, facilities and resources that are present to support their civil protection. In many EU countries that is the case and the EU CP symbol is displayed on designated shelters, hospitals, government vehicles etc. The UK Government should direct the Civil Contingencies Secrtariate to require Catagory 1 Responders to identify Civil Protection resources with this symbol in support of the UK Resilience and Capabilities Programme. This will achieve a common recognition of emergency facilities throughout the EU and highlight the governments commitment to Civil Protection.",
