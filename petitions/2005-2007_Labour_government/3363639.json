            "background": "Alcohol is clearly too expensive for students. The extortionate prices of alcohol are driving up student expenditure and debt disproportionately to the distribution of resources students provide to the economy. If students were provided with free alcohol, further education would be more affordable to the lower and medium class. At present a major factor deterring potential students from entering further education is the debt ridden futures they would face after university. Reducing this cost would attract a new demographic who would not otherwise consider further education. Thus reducing the current deficit in skilled professions.",
