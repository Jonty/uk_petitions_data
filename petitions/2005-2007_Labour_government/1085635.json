        "background": "Asbestos isn't dangerous. It's not a carcinogen, although the BBC, dominated by pseudoecologists, claims so. The only problem is that asbestos' shape is similar to what a sharp needle looks like - if it gets into someone's stomach, or if people hurt themselves with it, then they can die. But they can avoid this if they just work carefully on asbestos, so please repeal the ban on this useful fireproof material.",
