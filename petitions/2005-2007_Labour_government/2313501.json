        "action": "allow the re-opening of the Register of Exempt Dogs, to promote owner-led registration of dogs mentioned under the DDA who pose no threat to the public.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "DeedNOTBreed is a recently formed team of dog owners, rescue centres and animal welfare organisations who aim to promote responsible dog ownership and reasoned - rather than knee-jerk - responses to recent events. As parents, aunts, uncles, brothers and sisters, the group cannot understate the importance of the safety and wellbeing of children and the public as a whole. However - as recent events have proved \u2013 current legislation simply is not working.\n\nDeedNOTBreed is calling for consultation between groups including welfare organisations, dog wardens, Kennel Club, animal behaviourists, Government and police. By working together and sharing expertise we hope a workable solution to make the UK safer for people and animals can be found. \n\nHowever, in the short term, we appeal to the Government to re-open the Register of Exempted Dogs so responsible owners of dogs of sound temperament who are mentioned under the DDA can register pets without fear of seizure and destruction.",
