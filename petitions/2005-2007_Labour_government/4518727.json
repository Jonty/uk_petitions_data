            "background": "Why is it that men in the workplace are still required to wear ties, collars, suits etc, whatever the temperature, whereas women can come to work wearing sleeveless dresses etc.\nThis is the 21st century and sexual discrimination is supposed to be illegal. If women can wear almost anything to work (within reason), why can't the men? A tie is a health and safety hazard, and it is widely recognised that tight collars can cause strokes and blood clots in the long term, yet employers still mandate them. I want it banned, and people allowed to wear what they want (within reason) to work.",
