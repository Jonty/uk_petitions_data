        "background": "Breast screening is only available on the NHS to women over age 50, unless referred by their GP. Women under age 50 do get breast cancer and the figure is rising.  I was refused referral because I was under age 50 (actually 46 first time), even when showing symptoms, anxiety and requests.  And suffered, with advanced breast cancer and the trauma of GP refusal to refer.",
