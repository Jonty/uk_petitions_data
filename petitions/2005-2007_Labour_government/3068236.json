            "background": "As a black person who comes from a strong black family who have made a positive contribution to this society i feel that people like myself and my family are not promoted in Britain we are not all shooting each other, or drug dealers. In the media, in schools and even in the home we see and hear negative images of black people that gives young people no hope for the future. Nothing to aspire to.Therefore they look for the so called easy and quick way out by belonging to a gang or making quick money from drugs. We are such a strong and resilient people we need to hear this and to see it and it needs schools, the community and the governments help. The answer is not to lock up more black men at a younger age. I agree if they do wrong they must be punished but lets catch them before they get to this lets give them a chance.",
