        "background": "Immigration should be stopped totally.\nApart from the financial aspects this is a very small island & for the sake of the people already here no more immigration should be allowed. This nothing to do with racism, but the quality of life. In the next 50 years we will be crammed in like sardines & there will be no grassy areas left!\nAlso the NHS , benefits system  & schools cannot cope. No benefits should be given to immigrants & they should not be able to use the NHS with out paying. Housung is being taken away from english people that have been on council waiting lists for years & given to immigrants. If there were no benefits to coming here then 80 % would not want to come here anyway.\nWe should at the very least adopt the same policies as Australia.",
