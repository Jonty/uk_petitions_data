This nothing to do with racism, but the quality of life. In the next 50 years we will be crammed in like sardines & there will be no grassy areas left!\nAlso the NHS , benefits system  & schools cannot cope. No benefits should be given to immigrants & they should not be able to use the NHS with out paying. Housung is being taken away from english people that have been on council waiting lists for years & given to immigrants. If there were no benefits to coming here then 80 % would not want to come here anyway.\nWe should at the very least adopt the same policies as Australia.",
