        "background": "As per our associate members of the EEC. Why do we not charge non Uk vehicles to pay tax to use the roads in the UK, If this tax is not purchased on the continent,a penalty of large \"on the spot\" fines can be enforced.\nThis puts an extra financial burden on Uk vehicles on the continent.\nThis would raise funds for road improvements without the need to further tax Uk vehicles.\nThis tax can be purchased via vending machines on border crossing and at motorway sevice staions, this could be arranged at our entry ports.\nAs residents of the UK , we already pay road tax, however the amount of foreign freight vehicles entering the UK increases daily.\nWhy should we not  expect them to pay to use our roads as we do.",
