            "background": "Old Billy lived a full horse-life of 30 years pulling canal barges along the Duke Of Bridgewater Canal in Warrington.  Not happy with an exceptionally long live in service, Old Billy of Woolston, near Warrington, then had a further 32 years of retirement. His birthdate is unknown, so the unhappy day of his passing away on 25th November 1822, should be commemorated. A statue should be erected in celebration of Old Billy's extraordinary life, he contributed so much in the early days of the Industrial Revolution, it is time to recognise him!If Old Billy had been American or from anywhere else on Earth, there would be at least a statue, a street named & hopefully a holiday in his honour! So why not here? So come on, please, wherever you are from in this great country of ours, press for recognition of Old Billy, an equine hero, a horse to be proud of, king of horses, a horse for the horse connesseur. Let's not forget Old Billy was British, they don't make them like him anymore!",
