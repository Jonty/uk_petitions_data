            "background": "Iv seen the new logo for London hosting the Olympics and like most of the UK population I think its terrible.  Not only is it hard to read or make out what it is supposed to be, it looks like it has been done by a child, not by professionals costing Taxpayers \u00a3400,000.\n\nInstead i suggest there should be an open competition amongst schools/colleges/universities across the country to come up with a better suited logo, of which could be turned into a charitable fundraiser by opening a text/call to vote system with the proceeds going to needy causes.\n\nEven if this took 1 year to do, imagine how much money could be raised for good causes, and a decent looking logo!\n\nPlease sign this if you agree, and we could turn this monstrosity into something much better and gain from it too.",
