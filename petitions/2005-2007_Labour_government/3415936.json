        "background": "Too much money is spent demonising a drug which is only psychologically damaging to a tiny percentage of users.\n\nConsidering the possible side-effects of prescribed medication; cannabis is a natural and safe relaxant.\n\nThere is too much political friction surrounding this issue because the so-called 'experts' have no idea what they're talking about.\n\nWe hard-working tax payers should be allowed to enjoy a Friday evening without needing to resort to alcohol, which is arguably a much harder drug.\n\nCannabis is natural and good, now leave us alone to enjoy it.",
