            "background": "People who work full time and have no kids get no help from the government.Government states if you are 25 or over the most you need to live on per week is \u00a345.I would like to see MPs live on this amount.My mortgage payments are \u00a390 aweek.And that\u2019s another thing if you come out of work and you have worked hard to buy your home the government will not pay anything towards your mortgage until you have been unemployed for over 9 months by this time you would lose your home. Private renters will get full housing benefitThe way the system is if you work you are worst of then if you don't work.Good hey no wonder people are leaving England! I myself find that I am living day to day with paying high interest rates, taxes that I am paying more out then I earn.Government should stop paying people benefits if they have not found work after 3 months Get the lazy people into work!If I was PM I would make the working class better of then people who don\u2019t want to work",
