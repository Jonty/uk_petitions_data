            "background": "I propose that the government make free the use of 'Guide Badgers'.\n\nBadgers are highly intelligent beasts and would adapt well to the urban enviroment. (Bus, Trains, Tube etc)\n\nThe Badgers would initially be trained by 'Badger Walkers' from 6 months to a year and then follow a two week intensive traing course with Bill Oddie and Terry Nutkins where they would be put through their paces in a series of real life situations. e.g Being put in a burning building with a Badger eye mask on and having to find the way out by touch alone.\n\nOnly then will the Badger be promoted to 'Guide' Status.\n\nI feel that these highly skillful badgers would be a great addition to our community and I hope you will agree and sign the petition.",
