The Eden Project has the right idea, and has bins for recycling that are easy to use, and are pretty fun!\n\nWith a little instruction bins in public areas can easily be replaced with recycling bins that the public self sort with compartments for different materials. If the UK wants to meet it's recycling and emmisions targets and save serious money on recycling old materials  instead of using new raw materials this should really be considered.",
