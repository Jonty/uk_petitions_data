            "background": "The BBC is funded by the licence fee which every television owner in the UK is compelled to pay and the BBC in a unique position in its relationship with us and rightful has a higher level of quality expected of it. The use of D.O.G\u2019s which tell us what channel is being viewed and what\u2019s on next diminishes the quality of what is being viewed. The BBC has access to some of the most talented individuals in the entertainment industry and they have a right to be recognised for what they do. The practise of squashing up the credits to advertise what is on next or on the other channels should be stopped with immediate effect, it spoils the enjoyment of the show particularly if the programme was one that carried a high level of emotional drama and it prevents people from seeing who worked on the show. In an age when have access to T.V. listings in, EPG\u2019s, on the internet, magazines, news papers, and between programs the need to include a further reminder of what\u2019s on next is not needed.",
