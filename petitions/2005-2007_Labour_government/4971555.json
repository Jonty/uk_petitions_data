Not cyclists (if they don't feel safe in the road they should dismount and push their bikes beside them), kids on scooters or in \"heelies\" etc (pavements are not playgrounds; this should take place in parks) and anyone else whose activities place any risk at all to pedestrians.  We have little enough space, and it seems to be regarded as of little importance (e.g. no clearance of snow and ice in the winter), so surely that's the least we can expect (especially since we don't cause any harm to others such as danger of traffic accidents or pollution).",
