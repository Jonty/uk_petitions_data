            "background": "Our lives are frequently disturbed by telephone calls where the caller's number is withheld. These calls can be from various \nsources, some legitimate, some prank calls by children (the modern day equivalent to knock door and run) and some can be annoying sales calls.\n\nWhilst the likes of BT provide a call barring facility, at present it has to be paid for by the customer. \n\nWe ask that parliament legislate that all telecommunications services providers (land line and mobile phone) have to within \nthe terms of their license(s) to provide telecommunications services, provide a free of charge call barring option. In addition, \nwhere phone numbers are not withheld and are exposed to the recipient, the number must be a standard UK STD or international number, national \nlocal call (0845 and similar numbers) or free of charge call back number i.e. the original caller is paying for the call. On no account should the caller be able to expose a premium number for calling back.",
