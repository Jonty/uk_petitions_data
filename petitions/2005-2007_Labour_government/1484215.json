As you are aware of the circumstance in Zimbabwe, I would like to ask for your support on behalf of Zimbabweans who have become destitute in this country due to problems in Zimbabwe. There some asylum seekers who have spent thousands of pounds educating themselves, however due to lack of passports in Zimbabwe as well as their asylum situation this has led to destitution and extreme poverty. Many of these people are highly skilled and desperate to just survive against all odds. I can vouch for Zimbabweans, as they are hard working and desperate people.\nLet me take this opportunity to thank you for your contributions and leadership during your term in office. I would be grateful if you may consider the plea of displaced Zimbabwean asylum seekers living in the United Kingdom and if your government will continue to support us to end the situation in Zimbabwe.\nThank You\nO.T Slater",
