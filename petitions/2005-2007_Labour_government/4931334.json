            "background": "The metric system is use for almost all transactions and yet it remains illegal to use metric measures in some cases - for example for the supply of some products and on some road signs. This situation is hindering the wider adoption of metric measures.\n\nAlthough some people would like to continue to use old-fashioned uniquely British measures, many people would like to be able to use metric and are being prevented from doing so. Total legalisation would not force anyone to use metric measures, but would stop forcing people to use British measures.",
