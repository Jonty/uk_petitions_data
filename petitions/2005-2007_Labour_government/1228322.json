Often, they do not receive it even if they ask for help.\n\nJobseekers need to automatically receive help and advice in:\n\nWhere to search for jobs (such as a list of websites);\n\nHow to gain experience and move forward in a career;\n\nWriting a CV;\n\nFilling in application forms, and;\n\nInterview techniques.\n\nAt present, they are supposed to receive this help from the jobcentre, but members of staff take the attitude that you cannot be choosy and should go for any job available, usually a low-skilled job, presumably to reduce their statistics.  The above suggestions would reduce the length of time people are on jobseekers allowance anyway.",
