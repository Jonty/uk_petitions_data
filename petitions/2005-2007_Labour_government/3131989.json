        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Drivers who queue jump and then are found stationary in the outside lane of a motorway attempting to re-enter the queue to exit at a congested junction should be detected by congestion cameras and prosecuted for dangerous driving. For example on the M4 at the M5 junction near Bristol there is often stationary traffic in the lane designated for traffic travelling beyond the M5 interchange either to Wales or to Wiltshire. This traffic cannot pass and is effectively congested by the actions of a few idiots who need re-education or punishment.",
