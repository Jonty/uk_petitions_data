            "background": "Regularly in the streets of the UK we are plagued with sales people, religious advertising and recruitment, accident vultures, charity collectors and people trying to mine our personal data for marketing purposes.  I propose not to ban these people only that the law requires that they provide a facility for you to approach them and unless approached they remain silent and motionless.  This street-spam should be considered no worse than unsolicited phone calls or emails.\nWe should not have people telling us we will go to hell if we don\u2019t accept their beliefs.  We should not be asked personal questions such as \u201cHave you had an accident in the last 5 years\u201d, if we want to donate to charity we should do the approaching rather than be approached. I ask for us to be granted the freedom to walk the streets of the UK without interruption.  I ask for the right to choose to discuss charity or religion or ask for the services of a company and not have it thrust upon me or shouted in my face",
