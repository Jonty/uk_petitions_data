            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently access to further education courses such as National Certificates which ultimately lead to degree level education are chargeable to students over the age of 19. Those students also get no support with living costs while on a full time course of education, which in many cases is needed as a foundation for returning to university level. How can anyone attend a full time course of education whilst simultaneously working enough hours to pay for even the most basic of accommodation, food and clothing?\nNewer foundation degrees designed for those who have already been out of education for several years are highly competitive, and require some grounding above that of GSCE or O level standard in order to successfully apply.  This situation is preventing many from having access to education that teenagers are not only getting for free, but are being paid up to \u00a330 per week by the EMA to do. How is a mature independent student wishing to gain better prospects able to access education?",
