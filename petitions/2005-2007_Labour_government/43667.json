            "background": "Petrol costs about 0.85p per litre at the moment and out of that, roughly 0.35p of that is the actual cost of the fuel itself.  The tax and VAT alone costs more than the product itself at about 0.50p per litre.\nIn a typical \u00a325 fill up, the fuel only costs roughly \u00a310.32, the rest is purely tax.\n\nWe all have to get to work some how, especially in rural area's where public transport is practially non existant and the rate of tax on fuel is simply unacceptable when the money is spent on anything but finding alternative fuels, improving roads or sorting out the public transport nightmare.\n\nFuel duty should be reduced to a more acceptable level and investment made into alternative fuels, making road systems more efficient and improving public transport.",
