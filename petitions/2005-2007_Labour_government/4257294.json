        "background": "Many disabled people on small disability pensions benefit from the 10% income tax rate - their incomes are that low.\nUnder the new income tax regime outlined in the Budget they will end up paying more income tax in order to subsidise those on much higher incomes who will be receiving a 2% tax cut on the major portion of their income. Redistribution of wealth from the disabled on low incomes to the relatively well off is unacceptable in the 21st century.",
