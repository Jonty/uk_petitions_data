            "background": "In Kentish Town North-West London, and possibly other areas, there is a community toilets project in which cafes, etc., allow members of the public to use the toilets provided for customers without actually having to ask or buy anything.  This is  fantastic and should be extended throughout the country.  There can be few people who haven't had the experience of needing a toilet desperately but being unable to find one; this would obviously alleviate such a situation.  Surely the provision of a civilised way to perform one of the most basic of human functions is one of the most fundamental and important issues for local government.",
