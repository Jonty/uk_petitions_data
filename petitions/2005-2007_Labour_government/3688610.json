        "background": "When my generation were at primary school, we were taught to read properly. We were shown how to break each word down into individual sounds and then blend them together to pronounce the word. This method is called \"phonics\" and it meant that we could then apply this logic to all words, thus allowing us to learn to read ANY new word.\n\nNow, our children are being \"taught to read\" by just memorising key words that are used in their every day vocabulary. I know this for a fact as my own son and his reception class (4-5 year olds) are being pushed to memorise 45 words by the end of the term without even being taught the basic principles of reading. This method of so-called \"teaching\" is the major cause of high illiteracy in our country and it has to stop before it is too late.\n\nPlease Mr Prime Minister, you promised \"education, education, education\". Change the curriculum so that our schools teach our children to read properly, using the proven phonics methods that were used to teach us.",
