            "background": "I believe that the screening is not in any way in the public interest.  The Government and the public should support the two Princes in their desire to have this programme banned, or at least all references to the Princess's final moments removed.  Only people who are rather sick would want to watch this anyway.  Clearly, the Channel Four Chief Executuves have no sense of what is right and are only interested in sensation and Viewer appeal.",
