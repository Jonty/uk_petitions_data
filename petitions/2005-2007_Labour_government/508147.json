        "background": "UK residents with debt who experience financial difficulties are being victimised.  If a person is \u201cdoing their best\u201d to pay back their debt they deserve fair treatment and not to be penalised for the people who opt out via bankruptcy or abscond.  \n\nStop the exploitation:\nWith a good credit rating a loan of \u00a34000.00 over 3 years @ 13.8% APR, would incur \u00a3854.00 in interest.  With an Impaired credit rating a loan of  \u00a34000.00 over 3 years at 48.0% APR, would incur \u00a33000.00 in interest.  Finance companies force those in financial difficulty to pay more to cover their risk, this practice should be better regulated!  \n\nExplaining how much it costs to borrow money, is not the solution, people who are desperate will consolidate their debt by borrowing over longer periods and accept the extortionate interest rates if they can afford the monthly repayments.  How does charging people more interest reduce the risk of none payment?",
