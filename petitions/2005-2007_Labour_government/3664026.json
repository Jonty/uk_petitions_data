            "background": "Pagan handfastings are currently not recognised by the law as being an official marriage. To make them official you have to have a civil registrar present at the ceremony and when they're involved no religous material or influence can be used, which defeats the point of most of the ceremony. You would also have to find a registrar who would agree to doing this - not performing the marriage just bringing the marriage registry.\n\nMost other religious marriages are recognised in the UK when the clergy of that religion perform the rite. So on grounds of equality and ancient heritage allow pagan weddings to be legal when pagan clergy perform the ceremony.",
