        "background": "In Whitehall, lights have often been left on when nobody is using the rooms. The same is true of schools - even eco-schools - and probably also other government-run institutions. This is an unnecessary waste of energy and of tax money that could be used better.\n\nMeasures to conserve energy would probably be best done on a localised basis, so as to fit the situation, with guidelines on an overall level that allow for common sense to prevail, both centrally and locally.\n\nIf we do conserve energy, it would bring us closer to our EU carbon targets and help to save the environment.",
