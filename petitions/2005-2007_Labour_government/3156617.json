        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Why not introduce a tax on new car purchases based on Co2 emissions? \nFor example a tax of circa \u00a310 per g/km of Co2 could be levied, therefore a new car producing 250g/km of Co2 would attract a one off tax of \u00a32500. This would not only raise public awareness of Co2 emissions but would also encourage car manufacturers to reduce emissions in order to keep their products competitively priced. This would not lead to a slump in new car sales as the 2nd hand car market would simply re-price itself to allow for this tax. This would be far less controversial than the planned road pricing system. A similar methodology could also be applied to the existing annual road tax",
