Well, The \"Great\" Ken Livingstone is planning to use tax payer's money to build an enormous mosque costing an estimated 100M in the Docklands. Wouldn't it be better to spend the money on a new hospital or improved transport facilities?? The plan is for the mosque to be so big that people flying in from all over the world for the 2012 Olympics will it see it as the biggest landmark in London , bigger than St Paul's, Westminster Abbey or Wembley Stadium.",
