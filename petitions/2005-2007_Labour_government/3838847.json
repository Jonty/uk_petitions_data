            "background": "I think that it is rather unfair of companies to make huge profits in the UK, then make staff redundent in UK so to save more money and create vacancies in India. ( after announcing 7billion pounds of profits Barclays announce that they are to make 650 staff redundent at a call centre in Manchester as they are relocating the centre to India.)",
