        "background": "Bailiffs are set to get sweeping powers allowing them to break into homes and seize goods if people fall behind on credit card bills. \n\nWhilst this might sound like a good thing - imagine you have only being living at your current address for 6 months, or a year.  You come home to find your front door kicked in and most of your valuable electrical possessions gone.  Have you been burgled? No - this could be the result of baliffs either getting the address wrong - or trying to collect a debt that belongs to the previous owner / tennant.\n\nHow do you feel now?  Legally the Baliffs will have done nothing wrong - its 'not there fault' the previous person has not kept them informed of an address change - and honest citizens like us could have been legally ransacked!\n\nSign this petition now to stop this madness!",
