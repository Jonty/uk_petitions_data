            "background": "This a petition to ask the government to release a Car Insurance Disk, like a tax disk but for insurance. This would be to eradicate fraudulant details of vehicle insurance. A disk should be implemented to go alongside a current tax disk, providing information on the insurance details of the owner. This would benefit the Police, Traffic Wardens and those who have accidents and are given false details.\nThis system is already used in Europe to great success.",
