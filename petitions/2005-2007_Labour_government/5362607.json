        "background": "The Broadcast Advertising Clearance Centre (BACC) has banned the classic Tony Hancock egg adverts, claiming that they contravene BCAP Rule 8.3.1 which states \u2018Claims of nutritional or health benefits must be assessed by reference to the concept of a balanced diet.' \nThere is no suggestion by the adverts that eggs should be the only food eaten, and there are no rules limiting the number of eggs that an individual can eat in a week, so 7 a week would be perfectly acceptable. \nDo the BACC really have such little faith in the UK viewing public that they think people would start to exist on a diet of only eggs?? This seems like Bureaucracy gone mad.",
