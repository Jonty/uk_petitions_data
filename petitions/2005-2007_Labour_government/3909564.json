We need an example set at the highest level to show that people in the privileged position of speaking in public will achieve a greater effect if they improve the quality of their spoken language.\n\nIn latter years there has been a significant degradation in the quality of the spoken word heard in everyday life.  It is becoming ever more difficult to understand what is said on the radio and television as the quality of enunciation and diction diminishes.\n\nWhile regional and local accents and dialects are usually pleasant to hear, the excessive use of glottal stops (.. he\u2019s go. a forced way of speaking ..) and 'w' instead of 'l' (.. 'peopoow' for 'people', 'powicy' for 'policy' and 'canow' for 'canal' ..) become a distraction for the listener which severely reduces the likelihood that the thoughts of the speaker will be transferred safely.  The speaker has simply wasted breath and effort.",
