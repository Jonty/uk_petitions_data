            "background": "Holiday and flight prices during the school holidays are considerably higher than at other times, forcing parents to take their children out of school during term time.\nThis means children are missing out on valuable learning experiences, as well as teaching them that holidays are more important than education.  This also contributes to the high levels of \"truancy\", as holidays taken over and above the 10 day allowance are considered unauthorised.\nWe need the government to force holiday and flight companies to set a standard rate, such as off-peak from oct-mar, peak from apr-sept, regardless of the week a holiday is taken.\nThis will reduce holiday costs for parents, truancy levels, and loss of learning for children.",
