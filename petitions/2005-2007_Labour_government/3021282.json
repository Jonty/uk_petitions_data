            "background": "When a child hits the age of one, automatically a mothers right to free prescriptions ceases. More often than not, a mother to a child of this age is still experiencing health problems that have been caused as a direct result of the pregnancy and/or child birth. If this is the case, we believe amother should still be entitled to each specific drug needed for these problems to be supplied on a free prescription until the time the medication is not needed any longer. Many mothers have to stop taking some or all of their medication due to the cost, and in some cases , especially post natal depression, this can be very dangerous! Also, because of this people will be suffering in pain due to the fact they just cannot afford the medication.",
