        "background": "Body Image is a massive issue. It may not seem like it, but it affects all aspects of young people's lives, even those of adults. Often, we are bombarded with different ideas of a healthy body, an attractive image, and it leads us to have very low self-esteem. The number of people this affects is rising every year. Even boys are now starting to feel the effects. It needs to be prevented, as I believe its an acquired belief.\nSchools need only do one lesson (At least) of it a year, starting as soon as possible, so that it develops each time, and is never left behind all together. This is all we need to make a start, and one lesson won't hardly change any exsisting curriculum!",
