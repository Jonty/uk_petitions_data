Come on people out there, lets do something now before its too late, and we burst at the seams, Let the government know how we all feel, and make them see the truth, we as british citizens have had enough.  Enough is Enough, We are british, we are proud of our heritage, and are sick of being run by stupid people with no common sense, and by rules by the EU and politically correct people, and Human Rights, We managed without all of these rules for the last 50 yrs to my knowledge, so lets stop it all now  Other governments seem to manage it Why can't ours",
