With the effect that bloggers are regarded in their own right as \"press editors\" and should write responsibly with the following points taken into consideration:\ni) They must not publish inaccurate, misleading, libellous or distorted information.\nii) An inaccuracy, misleading statement or distortion once recognised must be corrected, promptly and with due prominence \u2013 and an apology published.\niii) They must distinguish clearly between comment, conjecture and fact.\niv) Any internet entry must report fairly and accurately the outcome of an action for defamation to which it has been a party.\nv) Everyone is entitled to respect for his or her private and family life, home, health and correspondence, including digital communications. Editors will be expected to justify intrusions into any individual's private life without consent.",
