            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In 2006, the daily capping rate for a 16-17 year old was \u00a32, regardless of the number of zones used. TfL changed this in 2007 to be as high as \u00a33.10, depending on which zones you travel in. This means for a 16-17 year old living in zones 5 or 6, the daily capping rate has increased by an astonishing 55%.\n\nMeanwhile, the capping rate for an under 16 travelling in the same zones has not changed, and for an adult has increased from \u00a35.80 to \u00a36.20 - a change of only 7%.\n\nThis is a huge increase in fares, especially when compared with the fare increase for others. This increase is being imposed on people who do not generally have a lot of money, perhaps living only off their EMA allowance. Over 60s, meanwhile, who generally have more money than 16-17 year olds, travel for free in London.",
