They do ban regular players and more often than not for no reason what so ever BUT regular bots are consistantly active to farm adena which is sold by websites for actual money which is illegal and breaches there own EULA and costing players millions every year. Some 40% of players are reckoned to be bots and Ncsoft are aware of this but appear to be doing nothing.\n\nTHIS IS FRAUD.",
