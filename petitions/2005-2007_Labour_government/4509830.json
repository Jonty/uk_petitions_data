            "background": "The conviction rate for rape is 5% - the lowest for any serious crime. \nIn 1980, one in three reported rapes ended in convictions; today one in 20 does. Only about half of reported rapes get past the initial police investigation stage, a quarter end up being reported as no crime. Only 12 per cent of all reported cases actually get to trial. When they do, the victim all too often ends up on trial; it is almost assumed that she is lying. In fact, the rate of false allegations for rape is the same as for other crimes. Women are now being faced with having their anonymity removed, and some have already faced trial for perjury; how traumatic, if they genuinely have been raped. A not guilty verdict does not mean that no rape took place. Being raped is traumatic enough - this shouldn't be made worse when reporting it. We urgently need reforms to the way rape is tried, such as expert witnesses in trials who can explain how rape victims behave and dispel myths. We need an education campaign to remind the general public that no means no, whatever the victim is wearing, whether she knew the victim, and however she behaves. If a woman has not said yes, a decent man assumes she does not consent.",
