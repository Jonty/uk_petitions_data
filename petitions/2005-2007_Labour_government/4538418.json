        "background": "ISAs were introduced to encourage the nation to save for their future. Financial intitutions, including Building Societies are exploiting these to make unwarrented profits and charges. CASH ISAs have transfer charges imposed. Share & Investment ISAs have become wrappers for all sorts of funds making excess profits for those running them whilst supposedly providing good returns for the investor because of the TAX \"SAVINGS\" involved in an ISA. In many cases the invester would do better to use a non-ISA service and pay the TAX, benefiting both the Government and the individual with more competitive returns.\n\nPlease pass legislation to regulate these organisations so they can't use the \"TAX FREE\" label as an incentive to con the general public into believing they are getting a better deal.",
