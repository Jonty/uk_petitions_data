        "background": "England must be the only democratic nation on Earth that has never flown its flag above the Parliament that governs it.\n\nThe Union Flag presently flies from Victoria's Tower on the Houses of Parliament (previous to the Union Flag the Royal Standard was flown).  Victoria's Tower has one flagpole and the present rules state that the Union Flag must fly in a superior position to the Cross of St George even on St George's Day.\n\nBut the English flag has never been flown, not even on St George's Day, and not even in an inferior position to the Union Flag.\n\nThe Scottish Parliamentary Corporate Body's policy is to fly both the Saltire (Scottish Flag of St Andrew) and the Union Flag certain specified days. \n\nWhy can't the UK Parliament honour England's national day in this way?",
