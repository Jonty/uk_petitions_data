            "background": "At present there are just a handful of mainly semi-retired dentists visiting the disabled, housebound and infirm able to do only basic dentistry (such as tooth-cleaning) due to not having the means to transport equipment- we need mobile dentists with a full range of services able to implement necessary and some cosmetic dental work, not partial as is the case now. Extremely vulnerable people are in pain and shame with no recourse due to lack of full dental services, let's get at least one mobile dentist with all equipment to do any dental job required in all councils now",
