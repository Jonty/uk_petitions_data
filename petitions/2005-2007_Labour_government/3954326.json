        "background": "Dear Mr Blair,\n\nThe recent documentary on Channel 4, refered to in the petition title, gave a lot of scientific evidence that global warming is in fact a natural cycle and not the result of any form of human intervention.\n\nI want you to watch this documentary, and then try to explain why this overwhelming evidence was ignored in the recent Stern Report, and why government continues to excessively  (almost obsessively) focus on this issue. In reality, 'global warming' is simply a guise for yet another stream of tax revenue.",
