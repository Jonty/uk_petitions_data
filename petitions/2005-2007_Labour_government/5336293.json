            "background": "BBC News: Columbia University to create \"vertical farms\" \n\nProbs;\n1)Increasing population, needs a lot of food from large land areas.\n2)Biodiversity reduced from 100's, to just one or two species. Also, \"lungs of the world\" (tropical rainforests)destroyed daily.\n3)Agricultural pollution into fresh water supplies, costs money & gets into oceans too.\n4) Waste of energy transporting produce around world, contributing to global warming.\n5) Pesticides & fungicides harm environment.\n\nVertical Farms- High-rise, advanced buildings- many floors, growing crops & raising cattle. Solar panels use sun's energy.\n\nSolution:\n1)50 storey vertical farm built on a 1 acre plot in a city- 50 acres could be turned into forest to\nfight global warming, save species, & improve standards of living.\n2)Designs are attractive- giant high-rise greenhouse gardens!\n3) No run-off.\n4)Transport costs zero.\n5)Can grow anything.\n6)Irrigation highly efficient.\n7)Enclosed- no pesticides or fungicides required- it's all organic!",
