        "background": "Having been bought up in the beautiful Purbecks in Dorset, I have seen the small village where my parents live become a 'ghost town' as the idyllic cottages and dwellings are snapped up for holiday homes. This leads to local amenities closing, as no-one lives there during the week and non-peak seasons. I understand why families would like to live there, but these sought after places are going to lose what made them special in the first place; sense of community, friendly neighbours and local people.",
