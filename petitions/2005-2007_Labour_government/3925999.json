            "background": "This petition asks that people who can trace 300 years' worth of British ancestry should, simply on those grounds, be given some sort of financial benefit.  Why should they?  No one has any control over who their ancestors were or where they came from so why should anyone benefit (or be penalised) for this?\nThis petition also repeats right-wing and tabloid propaganda as to the enormous sums asylum seekers and refugees receive.  In fact most receive far less than British people in similar circumstances.",
