            "background": "Roughly, the average debt that a student who leaves university has is a crippling 13- 15 thousand pounds. This level of debt with which Britains yougsters posess at the very start of their careers and adult life is completely crippling, for many practical and finacial reasons. \n\nAt this rate interest is accrued at roughly an extra 500 pounds a year, with most people unable to begin to pay off even small installments for the first five years. The debt rises, it will take many 1000's of people the next 50 yrs to pay off this entirely unnecessary and unfair debt and its totally ridiculous accrued interest. At least re-think the interest accrued, to prevent any further slide into debt.\n\n The government should be encouraging and protecting Britains future, not punishing, think of the consequences. \n\n Please abolish tuition fees, and student loan debt accrued within the last 10 years!!!",
