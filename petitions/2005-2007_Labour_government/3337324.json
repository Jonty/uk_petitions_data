            "background": "In the past few years women have been out performing men in these three areas. In areas, such as business, that women are outperformed by men governmental and civilian groups are created to help women. However, where men are underperforming no such groups are created. Further more for the past five years at the least women have been encouraged to perform at a higher level in GCSE, A levels and University. Many Universities even have official or unofficial systems for the amount of women they accept. As 57% of all university graduates are women these quoter systems should be aimed towards men not women.",
