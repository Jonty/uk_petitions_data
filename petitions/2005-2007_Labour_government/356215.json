            "background": "The latest round of cuts proposed to the Royal Navy - mothballing of almost half the current fleet, not proceeding with the order for two new aircraft carriers and reducing the order for Type 45 destroyers - will be a disaster for Britain. It will leave our island nation undefended, we will be unable to protect our interests abroad, the final remnants of our ship building industry will be lost forever and we will suffer humiliation on the international status.",
