I urge you to  reinstate his OBE, or better still knight him,  as he deserves it.  The loss of his OBE caused him much sadness. He probably did more for his sport than any other individual and was proud to represent Queen and country.  He is known and respected internationally for his professionalism, horsemanship and sportsmanship.",
