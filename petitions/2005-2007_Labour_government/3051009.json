            "background": "The petition calling for the Government to abandon plans for a National ID Scheme attracted almost 28,000 signatures, yet the only response from the Prime Minister was an e-mail setting out his arguments for ID cards. The vast majority of people signing the petition will have already understood, and rejected, these arguments. This is why they decided to sign the petition. It is likely that the more than 1.5 million people who signed the road pricing petition will receive a similar response. Whilst petitions such as these should not form the basis of Government Policy, they should provoke debate. Reiterating your own, well know, arguments does not constitute debate. We call on the Prime Minister to respect the views of voters.",
