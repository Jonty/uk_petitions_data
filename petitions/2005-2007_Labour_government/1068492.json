            "background": "Too many women are having abortions and costing the country too much.  It is only 9 months out of their lives and they can give the child up for adoption.  \nEncourage women who do not want to risk getting pregnant (particularly teenagers and young adults unmarried) to ABSTAIN!  Teach them to think logically instead of being overcome by their hormones.  In fact, we adults should model logical and not irrational thinking!\n(This is not to condemn those who have done this.  It should not be criminal offense - just deemed an uneducated response to stress of pregnancy - regardless of how it came to be).",
