            "background": "The Inheritance Tax threshold has not kept pace with house prices over the past decades.  As a result, the numbers liable have soared to more than 35,000 or 6 per cent of estates.  Inheritance Tax was only intended to hit the wealthy, normally accepted to be the top 1 per cent of earners.  The threshold should be increased to \u00a32 million to take the burden off ordinary people.  The cost would be about \u00a32.5 billion in 2007-08 and is fully affordable.",
