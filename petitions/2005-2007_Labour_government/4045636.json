            "background": "I would like to see a vehicle microchip ID system that identifies and penalises inneficient/thirsty cars through fuel pricing at the pump. \n\nThe chip would be mounted near the cars filler cap and would be read by a device on the forecourt pump nozzle. This information would then be relayed to the cash desk where owners of heavy CO2 polluting vehicles would be required by law to pay a much higher fuel tax.\n\nA digital photograph of the vehicle could be embedded in the ID and a simple check via forecourt cctv would help ensure that the ID has not been tampered with and matches the actual vehicle being filled. \n\nExtra tax eventually raised would pay for the system roll out. Drivers would then be encouraged to downsize their car or reduce their mileage, thereby helping the UK to meet it's CO2 reduction targets.",
