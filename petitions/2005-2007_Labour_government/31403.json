            "background": "Staffordshire County Council (SCC) are proposing to cut the salaries of staff after \"job evaluation\" interviews.  This is to try and implement the Single Status Agreement.   We support the single status agreement however, under the current arrangements many thousands of staff are being asked to accept pay cuts ranging from \u00a31000-\u00a312000 in monetary terms and between 10%-42% in percetage terms. We also have no confidence in the process as many employees were not interviewed as generic type responses were submitted. We also feel that many services to the public in Staffordshire will suffer as many dedicated and loyal employees will  leave particularly, in schools.  This in turn will harm the education of our children.  We seek your support and want to petition the Prime Minister.
