            "background": "An anomaly in the free world, the United Kingdom is without a codified constitution and without any entrenched (above Parliament) acts of law. Liberal democracy and capitalism in this country is at the mercy of the Government, and a majority of one in the House of Commons can ebb such freedoms away. As a result, the Bill of Rights 1689 and the Magna Carta have largely been disposed of by successive governments. In the last few years, the government has passed: Detention without trial, the destruction of Habeas Corpus and Double Jeopardy, ASBOs, the ID database and cards, and the Civil Contingencies Act of 2004. These are all such examples of what the Government can do when there is weak constitutional oversight. \n\nIn signing this petition you're committing yourself to the idea that Parliament should be subject to a constitution which will outlaw any bill which goes against the values and principles of the British People, thus safeguarding the democratic future of our islands.",
