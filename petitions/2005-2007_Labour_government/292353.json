            "background": "Motorcycles have the sort of acceleration that makes overtaking slower-moving traffic easy and safe. However, overtaking a line of cars travelling at 50mph whilst not exceeding the national 60mph limit is both perverse and dangerous.\nBy introducing a higher speed limit for motorcycles, safe overtaking can be achieved without compromising either the safety of the rider or the general public.\nAny claim that the introduction of different speed limits for different vehicle types would cause confusion is moot; HGVs and PSVs have different speed limits already, and law enforcement officers should require relatively little training in order to tell the difference between a two and four-wheeled vehicle.",
