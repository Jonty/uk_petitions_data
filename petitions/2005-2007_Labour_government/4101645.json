            "background": "English nature are putting Human rights for a home after unseen snakes etc that are found on heathlands.  an architect in Dorset I know has  had to advise 7 potential clients this year that an application to apply for planning would be awaste of time as even though on good size excellent garden plots.  English Nature would object was his advice   With waiting lists for housing and many suitable plots available the 400 mtr ruling is spoiling peoples human rights to have a home. He has  consulted the planners and in every case they have said there would have been approval but for the ruling.  In one case there is ony a 10th within the the 400mtr rule but it is still objected to by English Nature. To assume a future owner is going to have a cat or dog is a very big assumption.  Even so what is more important housing orthe possibility of adog being walked  I trust Yvette Cooper and the Deputy PM are both aware of this rule that is preventing good plots ( 2 near schools )  being built on",
