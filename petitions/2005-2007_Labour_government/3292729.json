With enough data available universities could analyse fingerprints in much the same way that handwriting has been analysed in the past.  A future government that is less benign than this one could then decide to cull all people with certain fingerprint characteristics in the interests of \"security\".\n\nWe think that doing the enabling work for a future cull of this kind is dangerous and should be avoided",
