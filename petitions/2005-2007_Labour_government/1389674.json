Not long back there were comparasions in football ticket prices around the world, England being the rip off it is, finished top of the table. Season tickets in the english premier league for a adult costs between \u00a3300-\u00a3900. Where as if you where to go and buy a season ticket with AC Milan it would cost you around about \u00a3100. Only last season i went to see Barcelona play. A ticket cost me \u20ac20. Where as going to see Darlington play (English League Two Side) a month later cost me \u00a315. Around about the same.\n\nLower ticket prices and bring the game back to the working classes!",
