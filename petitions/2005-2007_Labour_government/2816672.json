I urge the British government to consider the foreign policy that failed the Darfur people and send resources to stop this from being replicated.\nThese are real \u201cTerrorists\u201d, the real \u201cvictims of terrorism\u201d If we have an interventionist foreign policy, surely this is more compelling than Iraq, Iran or North Korea. It has happened before \u2013 it could certainly happen again!\n\u201cThe violence in Chad could turn into a genocide similar to that in Rwanda in 1994, the UN refugee agency has warned. The UNHCR says the killing tactics from neighbouring Darfur in Sudan have been transported to eastern Chad in full. \n\"They seem to be ready to accept a beefed-up force from the African Union and the United Nations to take control of the borders among them,\" Mr Kufuor told reporters \nMore than 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5m displaced since war broke out in Darfur 4 years ago.\u201d BBC News",
