            "background": "Having watched the traumatic events unfold in Iran, I was delighted to see the safe return of our service personnel.  I can understand that the time they spent in Iran must have been difficult and would not like to begrudge them their time in the spotlight.  However, when I learned that the Ministry of Defence for some \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d was allowing these sailors and marines the opportunity to sell their stories I was extremely shocked.  I do not believe that these service personnel should be allowed this opportunity when many hundreds if not thousands of others have went unheard.  I also hope that the recent articles in the press regarding the fact that these individuals are being used as propaganda against Iran are completely untrue.  I would firstly hope that the government takes our concerns very seriously and apologises for their decision both to current and previous service personnel.  Secondly I hope that in future you think twice before granting individuals opportunities which are not shared by everyone else.",
