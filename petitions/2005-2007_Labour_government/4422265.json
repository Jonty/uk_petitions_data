Our boarders are not being managed.\n2.Our forces in various engaugements are not being provided with the right tools for the job.\n3.The British way of life more so English is under attack from so called multi-cultural experts. \n4. This Government has justified the BNP'S place in our country with its weak management of our boarders.\n5. This Government does not respect our money, look at the NHS AND DEFENCE.\nWhen things go wrong they just hike taxes and throw more money at it. Get to the root cause!!!!\n6. This goverment needs to understand project management in order to deliver decent services to us.\nBritain, from the dark ages has always been a mixed nation of various blood lines, we don't need jumped-up multi-cultural gurus.\nPardon my spelling.\nSigning this petition is also a vote of no confidence in this government.\nI hope you will support this petition.\nGod bless our Queen.",
