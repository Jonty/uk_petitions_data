            "background": "Many couples know their marriages have broken down beyond repair but currently have to wait two years to divorce on the basis of separation. The only alternatives currently available are adultery or unreasonable behaviour, both of which can be very upsetting for the Respondent. Amending the required separation period to one year would make it much easier for couples to end marriages with the minimum of pain and embarrassment to each other and their children. \n\nWe also request a revision of court fees which are currently far too high and may cause hardship to many parties who perhaps are only just able to live within their means; divorce is already an expensive process and court fees should be kept to a minimum.",
