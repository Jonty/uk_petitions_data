            "background": "We believe that the Lake District National Park Authority or LDNPA is secretive, undemocratic, unrepresentative of local needs and opinions and has lost the confidence of those it purports to serve. It has wide-ranging powers, particularly over planning  matters, but is not directly elected. Its decisions have a direct effect on the livelihood and interests of local people and businesses. We believe a body with such power should be open, democratic and directly elected.",
