            "background": "The new London 2012 logo was unveiled on 4th June, 2007 and was immediately criticised for being inappropriate for the 2012 games. It's garish pink, yellow flared shapes look out of date and naff compared with some of the previous logos designed for the past Olympiads. If the logo was designed to appeal to younger people, there are surely better ways to design a logo which will make them feel inspired about the games which we all have high hopes for. The logo is an embarrassment to London and a farce.",
