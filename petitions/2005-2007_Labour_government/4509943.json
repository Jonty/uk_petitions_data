            "background": "Like many young single people, I earn a low income - just not quite low enough to qualify for benefits, as a young single person. I suggest politicians try living on \u00a315,000 a year in London. I have calculated that I will now be worse off financially, thanks to the abolishment of the 10% tax rate. Is this a stealth tax on being on a low income, or on being single and not reproducing? I could find the nearest willing male and have a child, but I have a career, and I am actually responsible enough to plan on having children only when I can afford to give them a decent life.",
