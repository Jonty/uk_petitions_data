        "background": "For a number of years there has been a vast increase of foreign hauliers and cars using our roads.  They do not pay any charges for using our roads and yet in other contries charges for use of roads are in place.  Instead of overcharging the british people who are taxed up to the max , lets charge the influx of foreign road travellers.  They have caused alot of british hauliers to go out of business due to their ability to quote better prices as they have better fuel prices, road tax and insurance. Stand up and save our businesses!",
