            "background": "This pilot scheme would be the forerunner of a nationwide scheme for driving on the right, once it had been proved successful in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland is chosen as the best testing ground for such a scheme because of its position within the UK. That is, people travelling to Northern Ireland would be able to make the switch as easily as they do when travelling to France etc. today. Switching Northern Ireland to driving on the right would probably also be the catalyst for the Republic of Ireland to switch. Once the pilot scheme had been successfully completed in Northern Ireland, it would be ready for adoption in the remainder of the UK.",
