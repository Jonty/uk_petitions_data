            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The proposal to introduce Identity Cards in the United Kingdom has been pushed through Parliament with the minimum regard to realistic benefits, cost or infringements upon civil rights.  We the undersigned hold that 'modernity', vaguely outlined and unquantified benefits (illegal immigration, database integration, convenience) and  supposed protection from security threats are sufficient reason to introduce a countrywide National Identity Register and National Identity Card.\n\nWe further hold that a public referendum, with full and frank disclosure of all evidence both for and against the database and card, fully explicated benefits and independently assessed and validated cost assumptions, is a necessary step before any procession toward the introduction of the Register and Identity Cards.\n\nThis referendum is necessary because of the far-reaching implications of the introduction of the Register and Card on every citizen of the United Kingdom.  It is absolutely necessary that the Government is held to account on every aspect of this scheme and supporting legislation, as the implications for the rights and liberties of all of us reach far beyond the term of the current administration, into a future we cannot know.",
