            "background": "It is patently obvious that the Uk participation in the US inspired illegal invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq has neither the legitimacy nor the moral ascendancy that the Prime Minister desperately yearns for.\nIf it were the case that the PM is truly seeking a legacy over his years in office, then there would be no cause finer I suggest than for him to voluntarily submit to judicial investigation of his actions during the invasion and subsequent occupation of Iraq.\nThis action would go some way in reasserting the United Kingdoms lost ascendancy as the mother of all parliaments, and may well remove the majority of U.K. citizens from harm or fear of harm by those foreign nationals who are well and truly annoyed with his actions.\nMoreover that if the subsequent sentence from any such judicial execution might be to suffer a very long term of imprisonment so be it. It might make him have cause to challenge the assertions of the crusader from the US next time.",
