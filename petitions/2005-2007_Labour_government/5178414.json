            "background": "I have signed a number of petitions, pretty well all of which have been rejected in a way that seemed very smug and which contained deceptive statements.\n\nTwo examples from the latest reply:\n\n1. The latest reply about sentencing said \"Sentencing decisions in individual cases are for the courts to make.\" which is true, but very misleading. Judges have detailed guidance from the Department of Justice on the sentences they can offer, and\n\n2. You said that you cannot reintroduce the death penalty because the 6th protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights had been signed. You were the ones who signed it- don't make out that it \"just happened\" or that you are unable to change it!\n\nWe the undersigned ask you to stop being so smug and decepting when rejecting petitions from this web site. Even better, please start adopting the ideas in more petitions!",
