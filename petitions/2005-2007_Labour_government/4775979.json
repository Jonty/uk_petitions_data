            "background": "You go to work, you earn a salary, and you pay tax. Then, when paying for fuel to get to work, you are paying further tax (VAT and fuel duty) out of monies that have already been taxed. You pay tax on interest earned on money that you set aside as savings, but interest payable on your mortgage isn't tax deductable, so you're better off paying extra off your mortgage. But then, god forbid, should you die with savings and maybe your mortgage paid off, the government takes another 40% on anything over \u00a3300k or thereabouts if you've had the nerve to work hard enough and pay enough taxes to be in a position to leave more than that behind.",
