            "background": "Proceeds of road pricing should not be ring fenced for any type of expenditure as this would not be tax neutral and spending allocations should be the result of a proper prioritisation process. Tax neutrality in this case should operate within the population paying road pricing, which suggests a reduction in fuel tax or vehicle tax. Reducing fuel tax rather than vehicle tax avoids penalising rural residents, avoids reducing the government's most direct influence on drivers' choice of more or less polluting vehicles and also reduces the incentive to smuggle fuel or to fill tanks in neighbouring countries prior to returning to the UK. Shifting fuel purchases to Britain from abroad has the added advantage of raising tax while reducing other countries' economic activity levels rather than ours.",
