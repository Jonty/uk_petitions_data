            "background": "On the rare occasions that the dangerous driving law is enforced it is usually after an accident. It would surely be better that dangerous driving were prosecuted before accidents happened? Better still, if motorists were deterred from dangerous driving by a visible police presence, effective law enforcement and significant penalties.\n\nCurrently the efforts to reduce road accidents are largely concentrated on enforcing speed limits by automated means. Unfortunately speed cameras can not detect tailgating, overtaking on blind bends, using a mobile phone, uninsured drivers,  unroadworthy vehicles, drivers under the influence of alcohol or drugs, inappropriate speed etc..",
