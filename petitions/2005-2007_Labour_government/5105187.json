            "background": "The 300 year old views stretching fom Richmond Park to St Paul's Cathedral are to be severely impaired after the Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government has approved a request made by the London Mayor to allow the building of massive commercial developments in sensitive and historic parts of London.  \nThis is just one of some ten substantial reductions in the previously protected views of St Paul's Cathedral.\nThe government should appreciate that a key factor in making London the world's favourite financial centre is its general environment, its heritage of historic buildings and the stunning views across the city.  \nEven if there was a valid demand for such development, there are parts of London in real need of such investment (such as in East London stretching to the Thames Gateway).  \nThis unprecedented and short sighted approval to such poorly placed development will be immensely damaging to London and its environment if it is allowed to stand.  We petition that the decision be called in by the Prime Minister and overturned.",
