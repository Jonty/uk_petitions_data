I do acknowledge that sports fans have a right to see their programmes but SO HAVE NON-SPORTS FANS.  It might alleviate the problem if at least only the actual event were shown rather than pre/post match discussion; I've never understood the rationale for this which is not applied to any other type of programme.  This Sunday, 17th June, I.T.V. is showing live motor racing but the programme starts at 5 even though the actual event doesn't start till 6!",
