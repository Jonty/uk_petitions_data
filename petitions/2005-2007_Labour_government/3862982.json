In some countries (I forget which) but whereever it was had ID cards which cost around \u00a36 each, surely we should'nt try to cripple low-income (<\u00a315k) families if we are trying to make them buy something which might help against terrorism. Besides, retinal ID cards are even cheaper, and can be harder to forge...hmmm.\n\nInvade France!",
