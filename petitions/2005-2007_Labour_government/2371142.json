        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Distance Selling Regulations 2000 do not currently apply to Auctions. Online Auctions/venues, eg eBay, in common with mainstream mail order trading, do not normally allow the customer to inspect the goods prior to agreeing to purchase. It is therefore logical that the Distance Selling Regulations 2000 should be amended to cover online Auctions/venues and their linked payment systems, eg PayPal, so that their customers' rights are in no way inferior to those enjoyed with mainstream mail order transactions.",
