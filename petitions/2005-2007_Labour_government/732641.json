            "background": "Proper full sized pools near blood temperature are vital for many elderly and disabled and others with poor circulation, (and are also preferred by children, women and the majority population).  Councils provide duplicates of commercial gyms and cold water swims to suit athletes who could find their own ways to exercise, such as jogging.    Instead, councils need to be firmly ordered to obey D.E.D and to divert the same money into providing facilities  essential for the most needy and frail to get exercise to stay healthy especially in old age.",
