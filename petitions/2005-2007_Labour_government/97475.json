Thomas Jefferson said information is the currency of democracy. Surely then we should allow for as much information to be openly posted as possible. The servants at number 10 should then love this influx of their bread and butter. Fortunately this is a simple problem and so is the problem of greed that blinds the systems of governance. However the consequences of such problems are too complex for 1000 characters to encompass. There is no freedom, no democracy.",
