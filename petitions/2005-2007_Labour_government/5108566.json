            "background": "Instead of living to work we should work to live. In the UK workers put in more working hours and days per year than people in most other countries. We do this for companies whose main interests are in increasing profits year after year. Increasing paid holiday entitlement would increase the number of people in employment as a greater work force would be required to maintain production rates and to cater for people enjoying their extra holiday entitlement. This would increase Government revenue through income tax. Companies may have to absorb extra costs and endure a drop in profits but the wider benefits would far outweigh any inconvenience caused, especially when many companies are making profits which are ludicrously high.",
