            "background": "Many pupils in years 10 and 11, the run-up to the GCSE exams, feel that they do not perform as well in coursework as in examinations. I feel that both are equally reliable in determining a person's aptitude in certain subjects. Thus, I put it to the Prime Minister that pupils should be given the choice between obtaining a percentage of their grade through coursework, or taking an extra essay question in the exam.",
