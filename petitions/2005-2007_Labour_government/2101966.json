        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In many coastal or rural areas the cost of property within a local community has been pushed above the means of local people due to the purchase of second / holiday homes by people more well off generally from the southeast. This has led to many younger people having to move away as they cannot afford a home where they are brought up. The tax would be 15% of the cost of the property to go towards the building of new homes for local people to keep communities alive.",
