            "background": "Troops in desert and DPM uniform waiting for buses out side of RAF Brize Norton are an increasingly common sight. Carterton, the town surrounding RAF Brize Norton, does not have sufficient transport links to the outside world. Only three buses a day travel in the direction of Swindon and buses to Oxford run every hour (Mon-Fri day time only) but take over an hour to get there. RAF Brize Norton\u2019s MT section does not provide a good enough service, sometimes not having vehicles or drivers available at the time when aircraft land. \nI urge the PM and Government to aid these service men and women when returning to the UK by granting public money for two 54 seat coaches plus drivers, to allow the expedient transfer to the Swindon or Oxford Railway stations. \nThis Government has sent these men and women to war, the very least this government can do is help them get home quicker.\nTwo buses and drivers is a drop in the ocean of \u2018\u2019public\u2019\u2019 funded vehicles, when compared to those used by the MP\u2019s of this country.",
