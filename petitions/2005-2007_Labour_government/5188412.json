        "background": "I have noticed that some petitions are rejected becuse they simply have a spelling mistakes or poor grammar. I have noticed many petitions that have been rejected because \"It contained wording that is impossible to understand\". When I checked these petitions myself I found that some of the petitions were genuinely illegible. But I also saw some petitions that I could easily understand but has a few rroneous spellings and poor grammer. I think that mor care should be taken in reading these petitions. As some people have trouble with their spelling and grammar, I myself suffer with dyslexia. i believe that more care should be taken in understanding petitions with poor grammar and spelling. I have tried my best to explain this petition without using \"provocative language\" and tried to keep my spelling and grammar as legible as I can. If their is any wording that you find hard to understand pleas e-mail me and I will be happy to explain.",
