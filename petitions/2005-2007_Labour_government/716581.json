Why can the Scots and the Welsh choose these things for themselves whilst Scots and Welsh MPs at Westminster STOP them happening in England?\nEngland is the greatest of the UK nations yet the one in which democracy has been stiffled as surely as our taxes head North and West.\nWe didnt ask to break up the union - so why should we pay for it.\nEngland is a great and proud nation, We want to be treated as such. Forget pointless and spurious regional assemblies  these would only divide our nation. I am English not a \"East Midlander\" or \"West Midlander\" (I live 100 yards from the hedge which borders Derbyshire and Staffordshire!!).\nA parliament for England. Only those frightened of democracy oppose it!",
