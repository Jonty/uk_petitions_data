        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Both mine and my husband's NHS contracts (in healthcare education) were about to finish due to a reduction in funding and so we were activley seeking alternative employment. We are both RGNs with a combined experience of 42 years within the NHS.\nMy husband has been successful in gaining full time employment outside the NHS, since moving I have actively been looking for work .\nI have two primary school age children to support and reluctantly I applied for Job Seekers Allowance to supplement my husband's income. I was dismayed to find that Contributions Based Job Seekers Allowance is only payable for a maximum of six months-regardless of how long you have been in paid employment and thus contributed. Our child tax credits have not been amended to reflect our new circumstances . Whilst I appreciate there are limits to the money available, I feel it is unfair that those who have contributed appear, to receive less than others who may have never done so.",
