        "background": "i feel 12 is an age where children have a sense of right and wrong and are able to take responsibility for their actions. I feel if they commit a violent crime, ie assault, then they should be dealt with through the courts. My daughter was attacked by two girls, one of whom was a regular offender and terrorised her peer group, yet as she was sent to the childrens reporter all that happened was she was referred to the local authority. In effect nothng happened to these two girls and they are free to do as they please and cause misery and upset for the next 2 years til they reach 16.",
