            "background": "Cars are a major cause of green house gases and climate change. The technology for electric cars has now matured and it is time to develop their market. I want the government to make policy changes so that owners of electric cars have to pay reduced or no tax ( such as parking, road, car tax etc,etc) for a period of atleast 5 years to help develop the market of electric cars. Even a small step like the above can go a long way in tackling climate change as studies have shown that maximum of car journeys take place within cities. \n\nRegards\nRohit Singh",
