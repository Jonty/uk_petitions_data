        "background": "The south east area of Greater manchester and north east area of Cheshire suffers from a very poor and congested road system. In particular the villages of Poynton and Hazel Grove are in dire need of relief from the traffic which is currently strangling them. Various schemes to provide this relief have been tabled and cancelled over the past thirty or more years, and it is now time to give the go-ahead for the current proposal, and I would urge that it should be combined with a network of real cycle-ways, which could greatly increase its effectiveness.",
