            "background": "Why should motorists convicted of speeding be forced to pay an additional surcharge of \u00a315 in order that money raised is diverted to victims of violent crime.  This is clearly unfair and an indirect way of punishing an individual twice for an unrelated crime.  If the perpetrators were effectively punished in the first instance, others would not be financially penalised for others actions.",
