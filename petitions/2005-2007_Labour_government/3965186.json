            "background": "It is no longer acceptable that issues of disability are never represented by someone who actually has a disability.  To be represented properly would enable the MP to experience and, more importantly,  understand the day-to-day struggles many disabled people face while trying to live a normal and active life on a par with the rest of society.  It is not right that disabled people are represented by a non-disabled person whereas other groups are properly represented by a member of their own type.",
