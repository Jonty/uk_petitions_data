MP's should vote according to the Peoples wishes and the Prime Minister be guided by his MP's. \n\nAt present we the people are ignored of our democratic wishes because MP's currently vote in accordance to the party line,  if MPs do not vote as the party dictate they risk being deselected. It is really saying vote with the PM (party) or you lose your Job. \n\nPrime Ministers past and present always speaks of  britain being a true democracy then Prime Ministers should allow MPs to vote in a truly democratic way. MPs should vote as we wish not their masters. So by giving MP's the right to vote as the electorate wishes we would have a fairer democracy than we have at present. \n\nThis petition is not against the Government or our political structure but how our wishes as the people are ignored because of the policies of government.",
