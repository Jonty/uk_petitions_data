            "background": "Alan Moore has lead the world in the creation of high quality graphic novels. He has represented the UK in becoming the leading writer of graphic novels in the English language. \n\nHe has dominated the industry, exporting British writing to the US and the world.  Showing Britain to be leader in the field and spearheading a trend of British writers leading the US scene, including bestselling author Neil Gaiman  and Mark Millar, author of the hugely influential Civil War.\n\nHis creations Watchmen, V For Vendetta and Swamp Thing are heralded as some of the greatest works ever in the medium, for that reason I propose the British government recognise his achievements officially.",
