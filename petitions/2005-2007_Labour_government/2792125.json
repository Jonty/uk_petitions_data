            "background": "As Londoners are to pay through their council tax towards the 2012 Olympic Games they should be able to have first selection of tickets before being sold to the rest of the general public and abroad. It is particularly unfair that people in Kent and Essex are nearer than those in (say)West London and they will not pay a penny from their council tax.",
