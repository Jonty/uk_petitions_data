            "background": "We would like the Government to consider making changes to planning laws that would place a responsibility on those undertaking building works such as extensions/renovations to produce a receipt that demonstrates that all rubbish resulting from such works has been legally disposed of at a proper local authority dump. Until such a receipt is produced, works should not be signed-off. This would help to ensure that people stop using disreputable companies to clear their rubbish which often ends up in small country lanes thus ruining the environment and increasing costs to the local authority and, ultimately, the tax payer.",
