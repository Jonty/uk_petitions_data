            "background": "The Monarchy is an outdated, undemocratic and frankly embarrasing institution for a 21st centuary country. To much of the world it is a reminder of old, arrogant colonial Britian, rather than modern 21st Centuary Britian. It would not impact tourism as people come to see the palace and Crown Jewels, not the monarch themselves. The undisclosed security costs (estimated several billion per year) could be much better spent.",
