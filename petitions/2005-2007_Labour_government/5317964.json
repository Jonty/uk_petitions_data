            "background": "The standards of driving on our roads are getting worse, and the fact that instructors are getting people through their tests by simply concentrating on the certain parts of driving that the examiners are looking for is mostly to blame.\nWe need to make it harder and for people to get their licence and introduce a Power/Size limit with regard to competence and experience as motorcyclists have to already. As it stands, a 17 yearold KID, can pass their test and jump in a Ferrari, Not so with motorcycles. This is wrong and needs to be addressed NOW!\nReducing Police Patrols and introducing more speed cameras does not help us with poor driving and uninsured drivers!",
