They can be hijacked by largley negetive 'bandwagon' causes which do not encourage an even sided open minded and informed debate.\n\nIf one has to keep e-based dialogue why not instead replace petitions with invitations to suggest multiple options for solutions to important problems - to encourage people at least to see different sides of the problem first before voting for elected solutions. Access to independent factual information should be given priority for each issue and this provision mediated by invited independent stakeholders panel, i.e. members of opposition parties, NGOs, Academics, Journalists relevant to the problem debated.",
