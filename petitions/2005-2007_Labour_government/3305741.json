            "background": "A large amount of the country's CO2 emmisions are from traffic, the peak time for traffic is when people are travelling to and from work. By reducing the working week from 5 days to 4 days the carbon emmisions due to traffic and daily running costs can be significantly reduced. The total working week need not be reduced, as a 10 hour day can be instigated as opposed to an 8 hour day.\n The extra day will allow families to spend a greater amount of time together which will also help combat the growing problems with the country's youth.",
