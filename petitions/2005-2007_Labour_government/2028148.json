We need to stop fighting in conflicts created by an egotistical silly little man (Bush) I can't accept that we went to war with good reason when all I see is our troops blood being spilled for Money and Oil. I am not too politically minded I am just a normal Human Being living, surviving and working to provide my family with a good future and I cannot help but see every day in the media one after another of our troops being Slaughtered in an un-just war. This needs to END!!! Please sign this petition if you value human life, end the unessesary suffering once and for all. Stop Bush and his Vision after all he has Iran in his sights next!!! Have a Voice, Be heard",
