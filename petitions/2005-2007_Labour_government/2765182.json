            "background": "A TIA or mini-stroke is a medical emergency. Patients are initially taken on an emergency basis to A&E. They are then supposed to be referred to a TIA clinic for follow-up diagnostics, and treatment, on an urgent basis. I have found out that in some areas the wait can be up to 30 DAYS before someone is seen. (And second class stamps used apparently for the referral letter from hospital.) This is unsafe and unnacceptable. The guidelines from the Royal College of Physicians say within 7 days. \nAlso clear guidance needs to be given re the taking of asprin immediately after a TIA to help prevent another. At the moment patients in some areas have to wait with fingers crossed till their appointments at TIA clinic, not sure if they should take asprin, which might save their lives.",
