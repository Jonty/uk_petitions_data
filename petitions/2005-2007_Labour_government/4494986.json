Therefore the \"morning after pill\" is abortive and not contraceptive. It aborts the embryo rather than preventing conception. This is not made clear to women wanting the \"morning after pill\". Women have the right to know what this is doing to their bodies.\nIf doctors need to omit elements of the truth regarding this, I think we need to ask why that is. \nGive women the whole truth about this drug when the drug is requested in any of its forms.",
