            "background": "Criminals they have NO sense of driection, care or concern or have respect for anything, because they are given everything for nothing. Going to prison is like a holiday, that's why crime is on the rise. The whole C.J.S. CRMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM is wrong, justice for the criminals and not the victims. The \u00a3\u00a3'ss costing each tax payer is not proving anything, it's all going around in circles. Criminals should pay for their own defence, prison facilities should be reduced,not made them feel like being on holiday. Non U.K. citizen should be sent back to their country when they commit crime. Anyone who commits crime 3 times their benefits should be stopped. Prison crisis is not about building more prison,it's about managing the one's we got, building more prison means more prisioners do we need more criminals? have we lost our traditional values.U.K. should be more robust, and firm in fighting crime. \u00a3\u00a3'ss better spent on NHS,policing other than criminals or assylum seekers.",
