        "background": "The total of City bonuses this year was \u00a319 Billion. This is 3% of the total wage bill of \u00a3620 Billion of the entire 29 million strong UK workforce. It is equivalent to 2/3 of the current level of wage inflation, and engenders fury and disgust amongst huge sections of the public. At the very least such grotesque bonuses should carry a higher tax rate.",
