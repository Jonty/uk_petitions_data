This movie shows only one side of an argument which, regardless of what groups like the IPCC might like us to think, has not been proven, and is nothing more than environmentalist propoganda.\n\nIt would be wrong to show this movie unless one giving an alternative view (such as \"The Great Global Warming Swindle\") were shown allowing children to then discuss both sides of the argument.",
