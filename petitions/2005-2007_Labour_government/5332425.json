The Satanic Verses is dreadful nonsense published mainly because they knew it would offend and therefore generate publicity and sales. His remaining works are few and of little literary value. \n\nAll he's done over the last few years is hide at the tax payers expense because of a row he caused by crass idiocy and greed.\n\nI see no reason to knight him, although I admitt the idea of the Queen waving a sword near his throat is appealing!",
