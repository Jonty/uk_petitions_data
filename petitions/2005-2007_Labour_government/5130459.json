            "background": "Within the UK, thousands of tons of waste that could be recycled are sent to landfill every year. The costs of business recycling make it prohibitive for many businesses, and there is little or no publicity surrounding it. With \"pay as you throw\" being considered for domestic rubbish, could the same not be done for business? The recycling of business waste could drastically reduce landfill and help the environment. Businesses could be given a ratings system to recognise their efforts in helping the environment. We urge you to take steps to reduce the amount of business waste, and to promote recycling for business, and to raise awareness of it, Make it easy to do and make it free! For the sake of the planet!",
