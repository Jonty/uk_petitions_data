            "action": "stop the holding of assets until inheritance tax is paid. Just deduct it and pay out directly. Any subsequent appeal will be about reducing the amount withheld. Thus reducing solicitors and banks gaining obscene amounts of money form interest on the bulk of the inheritance.",

            "background": "Why should the already rich fat cats profit from this old and primitive system? The present system forces people, who may not have much money and,look forward to gaining the inheritance,to borrow money to pay the tax, before they can get hold of the inheritance? Often large amounts of money sit in banks, or solicitors accounts gaining interest, while people have to find the money to pay the tax before the bulk of the inheritance is released. If the tax was paid directly from the inheritance as soon as it was available the heirs would quickly gain the bulk of the inheritance. They would not have to find the often large amounts to pay the tax up front.",
