            "background": "Driving on illegal drugs is in 1 in 5 accidents. Of 1300 drivers, 1 in 7 had taken illegal drugs within 48 hrs. 2 of the 10 who die on our roads each day have taken drugs. Government figures. How many of the 100 people who are seriously injured are also on drugs. What a drain on the NHS.\n\nDeath is valued by Gov. to cost society \u00a31,5000,000.\n\nIt is bigger than drink which is socially unacceptable, so not drug driving?\n\nThe police have a long winded process to try and prove the the person is \"impaired\". 3,000 prosecuted for drug driving vs 100,000 drink driving.\n\nA simpler solution needs to be implimented as in Germany, Switzerland and other countries. Positive drug screens are blood sampled for laboratory analysis, confirmation will back up the original police sighting of bad driving and the suspicion of drugs will be proven.\n\nStart saving lives, the equipment is available now. Signing the petiton, banning drug driving and get Government to seriously prioritise an amendment to the law.",
