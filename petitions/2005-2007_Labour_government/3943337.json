            "background": "It is a fact that more households have two or more cars than those that have none. We would like to see this change. HM Government should substantially increase the amount of road tax levied on 2nd/3rd/4th cars if one car is already being used by a person in a household. \n\nCar sharing, cycling, walking and public transport are all possible alternatives for many people in this country. Too many short journeys are made which involves  only one person in a car. HM Government should implement this as soon as possible.",
