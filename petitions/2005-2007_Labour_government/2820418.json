            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Fresh produce in one UK supermarket this week was from Brazil, Morocco, Thailand, Peru, Egypt, South Africa,  Spain, Holland, Portugal, Italy, Israel, France, India, Sri-Lanka, Columbia, USA, Cameroon, Zambia, Canaries, Dominican Republic, Windward Islands, Costa Rica, Greece, Mexico, Chile, New Zealand, Argentina and China. Shoppers would have hardly thought about the CO2 emitted in getting it all here.\n\nBritish grown food has a smaller carbon footprint, and is also subject to high standards of environmental stewardship and quality control. Can we say this about production in other countries? \n\nWe cannot rely on supermarkets to do the right thing with climate change. As soon as a foreign producer works out how to undercut our farmers, the supermarkets stock their imported goods.\n\n Food production security, quality and low carbon footprints should be at the top of our national wish list. Clear labelling such as this would inform shoppers about the real cost of their imported choices.",
