        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Whilst a lot of attention is given to the causes of crimes such as violence, robbery or rape, much less attention has been paid to the reasons why seemingly upright, well educated individuals of good standing, high net worth and the trust of their employers, colleagues, friends, family and even the general public feel driven to commit crime.\n\nWhat drives a man or woman with everything to lose to commit such devious and dastardly acts?\n\nThe Cabinet Office, ideally positioned as the results might impact across many departments and I have no doubt that its members are well versed in such matters, could undertake this survey study I am sure that the results would be both interesting and of great benefit to the entire country.",
