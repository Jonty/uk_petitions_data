            "background": "The current law on use of a hand held phone whilst driving is cast too broadly.   It requires re-drafting/re-wording as a matter of extreme urgency. \n\nAs an example, say someone has received a Fixed Penalty for checking the time from a mobile phone whilst stopped at a traffic light, which had just turned red. \n\nI personally cannot possibly accept that this situation counts as \"use of a mobile phone\" and also believe that the law should not have been applicable because the vehicle was safely stopped at a traffic light, which was in no danger of turning green any time soon. \n\nGiving out penalty points in this stuation is unreasonable and is only going to hurt the UK economy by causing too many people to become disqualified.",
