Well if you are please sign this petition.  I think that all foriegn people should have to support themselves for at least three years (paying their taxes and respecting the British way of life) before even being considered for welfare benefits.  From an Irish citizen living in Britian and respecting the laws of the land and paying her taxes!!!!!",
