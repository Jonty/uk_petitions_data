            "background": "All benefit should be classed as income and taxed accordingly and it should also be capped at the equivalent of a low wage so anyone out of work cannot claim more form the state than a lot of hard working families earn. This would encourage people to find a job and discourage them from having more children just so they can claim more benefit, we are each responsible for the number of children we have so the state and tax payer should not have to be responsible and pay for them. The money saved could go to increasing the state pension and properly fund the NHS.",
