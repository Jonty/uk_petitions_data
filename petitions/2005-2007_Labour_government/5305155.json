            "background": "Some Hospital trusts have a policy that funding has to be applied for if a cancer doctor prescribes Rituximab as part of a patients treatment. This drug can be refused to the patient. If the patient actually then wants to supply the drug they are penalised by having to pay for ALL the chemo also and go to another facility to have it all administered. The fact that a doctor prescibes the drug should warrent the use of it on the patient, funding should not be an obsticle. The practice of not allowing the patient to supply it and still get the rest of their chemo on the NHS is a discrace and totally goes against the NHS principle \"medical care for all\".",
