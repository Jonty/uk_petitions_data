            "background": "Birmingham social services/ Birmingham city council have decided that there is not enough funding for daycentres for the disabled. Yet again it is the disabled and elderly who suffer. The powers that be always have enough funding for themselves (ie;new offices)! Some people like myself have attended day centres for years. Its a chance to meet your friends and have a life, instead of being pushed to one side and forgot about. Social services have said that there will be volunteers who will help to take us out - but will there be enough of them to take us all out independently? And what about meeting the friends we have made over the years? We want a place where we can meet daily and do activities together - like we do now at the DAYCENTRES ! Just because we are disabled in some way, does not mean we do not have feelings and thoughs.\nPlease support our petition to stop the closure of day centres not just in Birmingham, but all over the UK.",
