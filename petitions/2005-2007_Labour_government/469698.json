            "background": "Non-commercial Wireless Internet access could be provided at minimal cost. Whilst the commercial offerings are falling in price, they do not provide easy roaming capability, or access for all.\n\nThe government response to the earlier free Wireless petition, at http://www.pm.gov.uk/output/Page10691.asp as with their approach to many issues demonstrates a preference to support industry at the expense of the population, rather than to use public money to develop and support cheap services for the public. \n\nManchester are apparently deploying a free Wireless zone for 2.2 Million people, and Norwich as the response details.\n\nThere are so many areas where public services run by local authorities, schools and health could gain too.\n \nTechnical support could be chargable, but given the spiralling costs of the various privatised Utility services, it is time the UK Government worked for the benefit of people and not just for big business.",
