Given the provocative nature of his work, in particular the Satanic Verses, we find it incomprehensible as to why such an award should be made to this individual.\nThe message being sent out to the Muslims across the world by the awarding of this title as well as its ramifications are more than clear. It is nothing but an insult, especially in the current climate where race relations are already tense. \nWe fail to understand why Mr Blair has decided to further add fuel to the fire of his failing legacy and strongly urge you to revoke this decision.",
