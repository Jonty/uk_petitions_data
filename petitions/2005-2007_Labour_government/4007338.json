            "background": "If the tax on aviation fuel were at similar levels to say fuel duty on petrol this would acheive the following, 1) Would allow the government to remove passenger taxes which would lead to less administration for the government and therefore less cost to the tax payer. 2) Airlines would indeed pass the cost of the tax on to air passengers so the impact on passengers would be neutral provided passenger taxes were removed, but the airlines would be financially motivated to a) use efficent aircraft to maximise fuel efficency b)ensure that their planes are full! - This has to be better for passengers, the environment, the taxpayer and red tape",
