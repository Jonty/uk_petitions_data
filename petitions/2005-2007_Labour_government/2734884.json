Judges will not hand out long sentences as they are liekly to be appealed against and this will look bad especially for senior judges.\n\nFor those people that do go prison which is more like a holiay camp now they can apply for parole after serving just half of their sentence they can apply for parole.\n\nSign this parole and ensure criminals are punished for serious crimes and not just given a smack on the wrist.",
