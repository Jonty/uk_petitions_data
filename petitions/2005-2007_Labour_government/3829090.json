        "action": "Create a smaller gap in the increase of demands placed on students during the transition from GCSE to A level",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There is a large jump from the demands placed upon GCSE students and A level students in which they are left on their own to quickly adjust to a new style of learning. Without a 'settling in' period, students are left with a larger workload with less teacher support, something they are not used to. This leads to a lack of motivation during possibly the most important exams they will take and is not doing any them any favours. What is needed is more time planning into the first term where students are slowly introduced to the new idea of independent learning instead of being thrown in at the deep end. This in turn will produce better exam results and more motivated and dedicated young people.",
