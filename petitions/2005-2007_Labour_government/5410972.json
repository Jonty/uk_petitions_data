        "background": "\u201cDo not hold up a long queue of traffic, especially if you are driving a large or slow moving vehicle. Check your mirrors frequently, and if necessary, pull in where it is safe and let traffic pass.\u201d\n\nBetter still; restrict movement of slow vehicles such as agricultural, heavy plant (JCB), horse drawn etc\u2026 (excl. emergency/recovery) from A and B roads during busy rush hours.\n\nIs there a need for farmers to tow hay, or muck spreaders, at 20 down major commuter routes shortly before 9am? Does that JCB have to be travelling 20mph on a busy, national speed limit, A-road with a huge queue behind it? Why is that HGV doing 30 in a 50?\n\nTravelling behind slow moving vehicles is aggravating, causes impatience and \u201croad rage\u201d. How many times have you seen an impatient driver take unnecessary risks overtaking a slow vehicle?\n\nI realise that this causes logistical problems, but I believe that by restricting slow vehicles from A and B roads during peak hours we can reduce accidents, improve traffic flow and reduce congestion into the cities.",
