Fresh and organic, farm fresh produce sustains London's local and tourist population throughout the year. The proposed viaduct by Network Rail will seriously compromise the pleasant environment in which the market has thrived. There are alternative rail links which will suffice but Network Rail will not tolerate because of the additional cost.",
