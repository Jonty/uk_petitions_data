            "background": "Papers are being distributed at an alarming rate at public transport locations. In London, the Metro is being distributed in the morning, the London Paper and the London Lite in the evenings, and the Evening Standard Lite in the afternoon. This is not exclusive to London. For example, the Metro is being distributed in 16 different cities in the UK. However, there are very few recycling points at distribution points, such as London tube stations. Local Councils should be obliged to ensure that recyling points are available wherever papers are being distributed. This would give individuals an easy opportunity to recycle such items, rather than leaving them on transport or disposing of them with non-recyclable waste.",
