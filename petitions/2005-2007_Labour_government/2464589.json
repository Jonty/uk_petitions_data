            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The revised air travel security rules - limiting passengers to a single carry-on bag, and introducing stringent requirements on the liquids that can be carried on board aircraft - have caused significant inconvenience to air travellers. There is little or no evidence that 'liquid explosives' are a real threat. No justification whatsoever has been provided for the new restrictions on the size and number of carry on bags. Coupled with new airline limitations on the weight and number of checked baggage, the continuation of the current carry-on rules is likely to increase the costs of air travel to many ordinary passengers. Inconsistent rules between flights originating within and those outside of the EU can cause particular confusion and hardship. Let's return to the universal IATA standards!",
