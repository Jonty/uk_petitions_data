        "background": "I am an adult with Asperger Syndrome and I live in Wales.  The available statutory support for adults with ASD's here is virtually nil.  The National Autistic Society (NAS) have a supported employment programme called 'Prospects' but there is not a SINGLE branch in Wales.  In Cardiff there is NO dedicated Social Worker for adults with ASD's.  The local Disability Employment Advisor (DEA) has NO experience of dealing with ASD's.  \n\nWe are reliant on being offered support by charities such as the Befriending Scheme of the NAS to help us to maintain social independence.\n\nPeople with ASD's are often VERY socially isolated.  I have approached every statutory body imaginable to try to gain some support but have found none.\n\nPeople with ASD's have a great deal to offer but many of us can only partake in society with appropriate support.\n\nPlease sign this petition to bring the woeful lack of statutory support for people with ASD's to the Government's attention.",
