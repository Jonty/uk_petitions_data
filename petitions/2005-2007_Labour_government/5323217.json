        "background": "Businesses are forced to pay for everything, shops and offices have to pay for rubbish removal making our cities worse for dumping rubbish, my proposal is that governments worldwide  offer businesses, schools and homes FREE recycling to help reduce the landfill strains and help rid the rubbish slightly on our streets.  Councils should also help push Free Recycling schemes such as RealCycle (www.realcycle.co.uk) and Freeshare (www.freeshare.org)at home where household items, clothing, white goods etc are reused without any reason to fly tip and throw away totally usable items.",
