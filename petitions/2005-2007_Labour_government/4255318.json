        "background": "From as early as six years old, children should be educated on relationships, love, being in love, sexual intercourse, safe sex, advice on where to ask questions etc, we need to take a leaf from Holland and reduce our high pregnancy rates and educate children and make them more responsible for their own decisions, from 6 years old until they leave school, if we are open and honest with them, it will form part of their day-day life and not be something experienced on a drunken night or to be ashamed off. We MUST act NOW! And have the government back a national programme for all schools, rather than the separate head masters being responsible for their own schools and each providing different levels of sex education. The programme on channel 4 \u2018Lets talk sex\u2019 hosted by Davina McCall really did open my eyes of how little I received as a child.",
