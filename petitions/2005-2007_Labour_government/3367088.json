            "background": "Professional qualifications can be important in enabling employees, especially graduates seeking work, to improve vocational skills and increase their prospective wages.  At the moment many professional exams such as the Microsoft certification exist but the fees can be out of reach for ordinary people.  The Government should introduce funding of up to \u00a3500 towards the cost of taking professional vocational exams.  Assuming just 200,000 people got assistance each year, the cost would only be \u00a3100 million in the first year.  The Government can easily achieve this by closing tax loopholes in the way it has done over the past ten years.  The economic and social benefits of this \u00a3100 million would be far greater than the cost.",
