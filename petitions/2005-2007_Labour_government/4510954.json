        "background": "To date there has been no proven link between mankinds C02 emissions and global warming. In fact, the planets greatest C02 producer is the oceans, and rotting leaves. Many leading scientists refute claims that mankind has had any impact on the environment with regards to C02 and that no matter what we do as a species, we will not be able to slow the heating of the planet due to natural rhythm.  It seems irresponsible of the worlds governments to base taxation etc, on issues with little or no grounding.  It seems about time we were told the truth, and not just kept on the bandwagon for the sake of it.\n\nResearch Topic: 'Great Global Warming Swindle'.",
