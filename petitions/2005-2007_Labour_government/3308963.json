        "background": "The experiment with inclusion has been a dismal failure that has failed both the needs of business and the genuine aspirations of many young people. Adapting the GCSE and A level curricula \"for all\" has led to dilution in real standards and false expectations all round, whilst doing nothing to remove entrenched social boundaries. It is time to work within the class system (which has resisted all attempts thus far to remove it)and provide a real alternative that serves different aspirations and values.",
