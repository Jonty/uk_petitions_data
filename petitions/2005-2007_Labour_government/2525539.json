        "background": "OFCOM are proposing to auction off 30% of the terrestrial TV UHF frequencies. This could include Channel 69 used by radio microphones in the television, theatre and entertainment industry. Large parts of the entertainment industry including pubs, clubs, local theatres and top West End musicals rely on radio microphones to provide top quality entertainment. Watching performers in a musical walk or dance around the stage holding a cabled microphone would really spoil the visual spectacle. We are petitioning the Prime Minister to protect Channel 69.",
