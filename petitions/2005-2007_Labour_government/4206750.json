There can be any number of reasons for an individual to need either short-term or long-term benefits: from illness/disability to inability to get a job (and I would refute, strongly, calls for such individuals to take any job offered; in fact the stress caused by spending 35 or 40 hours a week in a particularly uncongenial job could even cause a long-term psychiatric illness which would lead to the need to pay MORE benefit).  ANYONE can find him/herself in the position of needing benefits; they're low enough, in all conscience, and I've yet to see any petition (except my own) against the FAR HIGHER cost of TAX EVASION/AVOIDANCE!",
