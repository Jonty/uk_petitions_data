Due to legal wrangling, the BBC are considering dropping the programme: \n\n\"Long-running Australian soap Neighbours could be dropped by the BBC following protracted negotiations over broadcasting rights. \n\nThe BBC said that if agreement was not reached in the \"very, very near future\" the money would be allocated elsewhere.\"\n\nRead more here: http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/6595591.stm\n\nWe wish to impress on the Prime Minister the importance of Neighbours to popular UK culture.  Please don't let the BBC do this.",
