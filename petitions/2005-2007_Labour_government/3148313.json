The crew who put together this magazine work tirelessly and get little reward for their efforts apart from kudos. It would be nice if the government could put some money into supporting them so they could give up their day jobs and devote more time to spreading and expanding the music, art and other contemporary culture of Nottingham to the general public. \n\nAlso I think the government should set up some sort of scheme to promote similar publications in other cities around the UK.",
