I was bullied and forced to move school however bullying existed at the school i moved to, luckily I was not involved. There should be tougher laws and regulations on bullies! Why should a gang of children be allowed the physically hurt somebody, to the extent in which they must go to hospital and get away with it? They shouldn't! As you read this there are thousands of children who are worried about going to school! This is not fair, it is effecting their education!",
