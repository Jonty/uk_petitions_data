            "background": "The closure of the world's busiest airport would be a very strong signal to the world that the UK government is prepared to take radical action to combat the threat of climate change.\n\nThose of us who live in West London are totally fed up with the noise of aircraft damaging the quality of our private life at home.  \n\nFinally, aircraft using Heathrow have to fly over central London and this flightpath would seem to bring with it real risk of a major terrorist outrage against the capital of England.",
