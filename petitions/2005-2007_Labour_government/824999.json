This is the hidden pain of a family I wish a Labour Government to give attention to. The local authority, it would appear, operate as accountants and are not offering assistance.The cries of help from his wife caused the man to tell me, a Stranger, of his family plight.The man did say he receives respite assistance but the demands are so great that he and his wife need the daycare as well. daughter is aged 38 !!!",
