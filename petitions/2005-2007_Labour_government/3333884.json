        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The government at the moment are too reliant on speed cameras which are indiscriminate and totally incapable of using common sense or factoring in road, weather and traffic problems etc.I have spoken to many motorway traffic police officers and the majority have said there are less and less of them one of whom even said that the way things seem to be going there wouldnt be any traffic police in 5 yrs.This in turn is alienating the general public and turning them against the police who do an admirable job. Speed doesnt kill bad driving does. Remove speed cameras from the motorways and B roads and put many more traffic police on them to punish true bad/dangerous driving such as tailgating, unroadworthy cars, drink driving etc. Put speed cameras preferably SPECS in residential or high pedestrian use areas and around schools, parks, roadworks and such where speed really could and more often does kill. Speed cameras have their place as do the police lets put both where they belong.",
