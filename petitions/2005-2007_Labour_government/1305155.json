The ODPM KPIs still needed to be collected alongside the new DTI stats; and they were all worthless because there was no consistency in their interpretation and the definitions changed time and time again.\n\nThe amounts wasted in compiling this so-called data is scandalous; worse the people having to produce all this crap would all rather be providing a service to the general public (their ultimate employers).\n\nSort it.\n\nNOW!",
