            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Gordon Brown's decision in 1997 to eliminate tax credits on privately funded pension schemes has resulted in substantial reduction in pensions for millions of pensioners not fortunate enough to be members of privileged public sector schemes such as his own. It is contrary to any principles of common justice that government ministers can impose penalties to which they themselves are not subject. Ministers' pension schemes should be discontinued and the funds transferred to private sector schemes to ensure that the consequences of any such future legislation impact Government ministers at a personal level.",
