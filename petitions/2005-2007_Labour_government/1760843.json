            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "When 4x4 vehicles and large MPV's are driven by inexperienced and low-mileage drivers, they tend to take up far more than their fair share of the road.  For evidence of this, please walk around your nearest school at start or finishing time or (if you are really brave) try to drive around.\n   \nUnless and until the drivers of these vehicles learn how to manoeuvre them and park them properly, safely and with due consideration for other users, they should be forced to give way to conventional vehicles.\n \n(This petition is in response to one that claimed that drivers of 2wd vehicles should be forced to give way to drivers of 4x4 vehicles.  It is my opinion that if you are going to drive a vehicle, you should be adequately trained in its operation and not expect other users to suffer because of your own failure to be properly trained.)",
