Yet whilst they fight we have footballers, popstars, television presenters, flavours of the month, recieving the finest honours this land can offer. Is that fair?\n\nIt's time this nonsense and injustice ceased, these people don't deserve the honours which should be set aside for real heroes who never seem to recieve the recognition they deserve in life or death. It's an insult and a disgrace that the honours system is being so devalued.",
