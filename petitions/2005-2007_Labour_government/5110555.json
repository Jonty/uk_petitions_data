            "background": "The high-frequency devices, installed to deter teenagers from loitering in shopping centres, have proven themselves to be clearly audible to those under 30.\n\nIn this age group, from 30 down to just toddlers, high amplitude devices cause frustration and often pain, affecting the youngest citizens most.  In addition, a large number of shops aim their produce at this age range, and may be losing profit as a result.\n\nWhilst they have the benefit of deterring would-be criminals, there are no means for a person to quickly escape the signal generated by a high-amplitude device should it cause pain.  This issue is magnified greatly if the shopping complex is open to the air.\n\nThis petition proposes that these devices be given an arbitrary range, so the device extends only around the shop that wishes to use them as a deterrent.",
