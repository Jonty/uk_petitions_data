Cats are loved just as much as children in most cases and bring delight to many non-cat owners (same as the delight that some children bring). To encourage cat ownership and to make sure that no cats go without, a cat benefit should be introduced and we are asking people to sign this e-petition to try and get the PM to endorse it.",
