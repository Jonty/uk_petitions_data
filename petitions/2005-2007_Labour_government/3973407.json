            "background": "Conventional light bulbs are very energy-inefficient. The problem with banning them outright is that the alternatives are not always suitable. Compact fluorescent (CFL) bulbs cannot be used with dimmer switches, are only available in a few standard types (so cannot be used to replace the less common types of bulb), and can cause adverse reactions in some individuals. Conventional bulbs should therefore remain on sale until something better is available. For example, a high-efficiency incandescent bulb is under development and will be on the market by 2010. Bulbs using LED technology should also be more widely available by that time.",
