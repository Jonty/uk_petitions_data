        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In line with other anti-discriminatory legislation in the field of employment and vocational training, it would be beneficial to create a Commision by statute to oversee the current Employment Equality (Age)Regulations(2006). Age discrimination is largely tolerated in many spheres of everyday life and in many cases it will be tolertated. Inevitably the legislation will need to be amended to be more sensitive to affected groups. Because the Regulations have (sensibly) such wide scope in that it does not define \"age\" we all can potentially find ourselves in a position where we are treated less favourably than others where age is used either directly or indirectly to prevent access to oportunities to or at work.",
