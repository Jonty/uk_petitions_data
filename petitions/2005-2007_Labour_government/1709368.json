        "background": "We, as members of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, have come to the seemingly\nobvious conclusion that the limited range of Subway sandwiches should be\nextended to include 9\u201d bread.\n \n6 inches is simply too small, while 12 inches is often too big.\n \nBut then there will be wastage, I hear you say. Nut NO. If you bake two\noptions, a 12\u201d and a 9\u201d option, not only do you broaden your range for\ncustomers, as if they would like a 6 incher, you simply cut the 12\u201d bread in\nhalf. \n\nSimple.",
