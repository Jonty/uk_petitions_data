            "background": "Currently inmates are housed and fed at the taxpayers expense. I propose that rent should be charged for the duration of a jail sentence to every inmate. If the inmate or their families cannot afford the rent upfront then a loan can be arranged and paid in installments later in a similar system to how students currently pay back tuition fees/loans. This will result in taxpayers money being available for other areas and also acting as a further detterent to commiting crime.",
