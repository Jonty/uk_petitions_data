        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As someone who has the qualifications and training, but not the experience to qualify as a Chartered Engineer, I am permanently frustrated by my employer's refusal to allow me to gain such experience, as they say it is not \"in their interests\" to do so, and they already have enough engineers of chartered status. I want a law introduced which makes it illegal for companies to write off their staff in this way. In this day and age, with property prices etc as they are, and the engineering industry as it is, it is not easy to \"move jobs\" to find something better.",
