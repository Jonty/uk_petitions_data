Any person convicted of kidnapping a child for sexual abuse, child labour,or illegal adoption,  cannot ever be allowed to roam free in our society.  They should spend the rest of their natural life in prison with no time off for good behavior!I would suggest the people of scotland, indeed the world, should unite  and make their voice heard. Lets make the world a safer place for our children.",
