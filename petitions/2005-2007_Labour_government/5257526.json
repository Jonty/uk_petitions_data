            "background": "As an office worker, i often find it unbearable to work in the office during a hot day. I become sweaty and unable to concentrate on my work, especially as i have to wear a suit. I know that my colleagues really suffer as i do, often having to put numerous fans on or going outside to try and get a breeze.\nIn the UK we work some of the longest hours and should consider bringing in a siesta that other warmer climate countries have in place. Our climate is becoming not far off the temperatures that some of these countries reach, if not the same. A siesta would enable the UK to have a happier and more productive working population.\nDue to global warming and increased temperatures, this is becoming much more of a serious factor, especially as some offices cannot afford or will not bring in air conditioning.",
