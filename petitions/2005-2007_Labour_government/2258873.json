            "background": "The Government talks of creating or reinforcing a national identity. If they really believe this, why is the flag not flown in British schools? Why not fly the flag, as Americans and other countries do? Give schools the right to fly a national flag under the Union Jack, or fly the Union Jack alongside the EU flag, but fly our nation's flag! In my experience, Heads are to scared to be seen flying their countries flag, in case they are seen as racist. Why? It is our nation. Why not help create a sense of identity in our children. Fly the flag!",
