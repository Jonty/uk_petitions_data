            "background": "By definition, surely a dismissal is either fair or it is not. Employees should be protected against unfair dismissal from day one of employment, and employers required to show a good reason for any dismissal, with corroborative evidence. Deterrents by way of fines etc need to be much more effective, especially as many employers currently rely on employees being reluctant to face the stress and stigma of bringing proceedings against an employer.",
