            "background": "Some twenty years ago  if you were in school and stepped out of line you were disciplined. However now they  don't even get told off. How can they learn if they do not get a punishment. We have the nuclear bomb as a deterant so use corporal punishment as a deterent aswell.\nThe youngsters see an Asbo as an achievement. So I say bring back canning as a deterent in Schools.",
