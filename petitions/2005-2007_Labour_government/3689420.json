            "background": "I was unemployed myself for quite some time and the only thing I never got was the kick in the backside I needed. I believe that making benefit claiments, whether they like it or not to earn their benefits will push them on to making the desicion of whether they want to improve themselves and find their own jobs or go hungry and homeless. At the same time improving local areas. But if people waste their time and the publics tax money then they should be punished by a reduction in the benefits according to how much time they didn't waste. Call it tough love, but i believe that it is something that would benefit claiments and the tax payer.",
