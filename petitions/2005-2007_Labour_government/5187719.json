            "background": "A term often used in medecine in relation to blood tests is 'normal' however the general public are mostly unaware that this is a statistical reference. It does not of itself  necessarily mean healthy.\n\nFew of the general public are aware that these 'normal' ranges are derived from blood samples taken anonymously from hospital Pathology lab, often from people who are either very elderly or very ill.\n\nThe fact that these so called 'normal' ranges are derived in this way results in a range that is quite often far too wide to detect any medical condition before it becomes chronically disabling and or life threatening.\n\nCurrently it is possible to be diagnosed with a medical condition by one hospital Pathology lab, whilst another one will report that your blood tests came back 'Normal' ....no treatment necessary.\n\nThe medical community should abolish 'normal' ranges and set about establishing healthy ranges. and ensure that because of individual variability these ranges are used as Reference ONLY.",
