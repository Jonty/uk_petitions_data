        "background": "The Nursery Education Grant is a nominal amount per hour (approx \u00a33.10 per hour.  Placing this value on the education of children is not satisfactory and does not allow nurseries to the best of their abilities.  Do children in the UK really represent a figure that is so low?  To start increasing the value that is put on the foundation stage will have an overall effect on education as a whole.  Lack of government money \"in the pot\" is not good enough reason.  Changes need to be made at grass roots.  Value our children and their education.",
