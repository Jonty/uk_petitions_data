        "action": "allow access to the UK Coaching Certificate solely to associations who are covered by the framework of recognition as implemented by Sports Councils under their system of National Governing Bodies. It is a fact that the huge diversity of Martial Arts can join an association that is  Sports Councils recognised, thus allowing Martial Arts to have a stronger representation, in decisions pertaining to grants and future events such as the Olympics.",

        "background": "The Government has decided to introduce a sport wide \"United Kingdom Coaching Certificate\" as a standard recognised qualification for all sports coaches. However this qualification will only be made available and accessible through those organisations recognised by the Sports Council, meaning that the vast majority of groups and individuals within the Martial Arts industry will be excluded, unless they join a Governing Body. The best way forward for all Martial Arts is to unite under a Governing Body and get the opportunity to attain a recognised qualification",
