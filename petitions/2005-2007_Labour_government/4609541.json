The most effective way to reduce this is by making it much more expensive than other ways of travelling such as coaches, trains, ferries etc.  \nI also deplore the absolute taking for granted of going everywhere by plane; for instance I recently asked a travel agent about going to Amsterdam and the immediate response was \"You can fly from...\" and when I said I didn't want to fly she seemed completely non-plussed.  And weekend travel supplements in newspapers have details of cheap flights; articles about holidays in almost all resorts also always give the information \"flights from...\"",
