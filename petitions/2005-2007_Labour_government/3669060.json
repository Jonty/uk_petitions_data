            "action": "increase the money available to the Low Carbon Buildings Programme, remove the monthly cap on grants and keep the grant for solarPV at \u00a33000 per Kw installed.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "From the 1st April the DTI will reduce the LCBP solarPV grant from \u00a33000 to \u00a32000 per Kw installed, and this is after capping the level of grant to \u00a3500,000 per month. The reasons they have had to do this is because the LCBP is massively under funded. The grants system encourages the use of microgeneration technologies for both domestic homes, business and social projects. In February the money ran out in just 12hrs, in March it ran out in just 1.5hrs. Quite clearly this country could have a greater capacity for microgeneration judging by the demand for grants, and its a shame that not only do those who want to lower the carbon emissions of this country lose out but the businesses which are fueling the demand are also damaged by these ridiculous rules.",
