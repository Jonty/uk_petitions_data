            "background": "The UK currently emits less than 2% of the global output of CO2 emissions yet the government is conning the gullible public into paying carbon taxes stating that we can make a difference to help stop climate change by doing so.\nIn effect, if the UK were to stop all emissions tomorrow, there would be no real difference in the carbon emissions that are currently pumped into the atmosphere by the rest of the world.\nChina, With building up to 2 coal fired power stations per week would soon take up the 2% that we give up and thus, wouldn't make any difference to our stopping emissions in the UK altogether. \nWe call on the government to scrap all carbon taxes as all they are there for, is to boost the government coffers and not, as we are told, to help stop global warming!",
