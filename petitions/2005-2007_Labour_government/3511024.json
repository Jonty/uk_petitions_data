Most have given up even imagining that this will ever change.\n\nNow it seems that they must also accept being used as punchbags at work.  If someone rammed a syringe in the PM's hand, or wrapped a chair around his head, I think it quite likely that the CPS would prosecute the case.\n\nDo our nurses, doctors and auxilliary staff deserve any less as they struggle to treat drunk and abusive patients.\n\nThe PM should ensure that the CPS are forced to stop dropping cases.\n\nWe have a moral obligation to protect people at work, and to prosecute those who abuse them",
