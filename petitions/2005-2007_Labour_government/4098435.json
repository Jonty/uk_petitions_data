        "background": "Why should the Public Pay for criminals to be properly punished? They should pay for it themselves. Prisons are now practically holiday camps with the criminals food, electricy and keep all paid for by the tax payer, this is unfair. If criminals pay for their own incarceration there will be more money available for the services that need it (NHS, More Prisons.. etc). Also it would act as a greater deterant from crime than just a few months in a \"holiday camp\", You'd come out of Prison with more than \"Respect\" from your friends, you'd have a nice bill too. Fees could be deducted from future paychecks/ benefits like how university fees are. Or property could be claimed by the government to pay the fee if the offender doesn't work after release.",
