        "background": "It's very difficult to get funding, if you're an SME, to help with the implementation of an idea for a new product or service. There's plenty of support for R&D, for big ideas and for developed ideas but very little currently for SMEs who need help with evaluating, planning and marketing their idea quickly. \n\nInnovation is the life blood of our future economic success. Encouraging lots of people to take their ideas beyond the dream stage, even if most of them fail, will create more jobs, generate more income etc. and benefit all of us.",
