        "action": "refine the current hunting legislation to ban hunting of any kind with more than 2 dogs",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The weak legislation covering the hunting with dogs has so many loopholes, and is blatantly ignored by some members of the hunting fraternity. Banning hunting with more than two dogs will allow farmers etc to hunt game, and other animals for consumption, while stopping the practice of hunting foxes with a large pack of dogs to 'make them break cover to be shot' or to loose hunting birds on them, and will prevent the so called 'regretable incidents where the pack tears the fox to pieces.",
