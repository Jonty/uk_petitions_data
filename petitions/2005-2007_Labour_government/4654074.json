            "background": "Thousands of Victorian terraces in Liverpool are going to be demolished to make room for a new housing development and road infrastructure. The new development will contain fewer houses than the old terraces, many of which are very desirable homes worth a lot of money.\nResidents will be faced with Compulsory Purchase Orders, forcing them to sell their homes to the government for amounts far less than the houses are worth.\nThis plan undermines the heritage of the city, is going to cost millions of pounds, and result in inferior housing.",
