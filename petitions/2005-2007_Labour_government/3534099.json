            "background": "Blocking call transfer between mobile [cellular] phone masts will by definition make it largely impossible to make & or receive calls whilst moving [including being a passenger on trains, underground].\n\nThe 'footprint' of masts, especially in 'built-up' areas, is a few square-miles at best. In many areas calls will only be possible whilst stationary.\n\nCutting-off calls when a mobile [cellular] phone moves from one mast to another, paired with a free automated message [e.g., 'conversation terminated with moving mobile [cellular] caller'] to all those in that call [with an SMS too [as above]], will create a near 100% compliance.\n\nFines will never stop everybody using a mobile [celluar] phone whilst driving, technology as described will.",
