            "background": "We believe that prisoners should lose any right to early release if they have committed sexual or violent offences or if they have been imprisoned for the same offence more than once.\n\nPrison works because it removes offenders from public harm and deters offenders. \n\nRemoving violent or sex offenders from the streets to prevent them from re-offending must be the main concern of sentencing and parole authorities. Removing the right to early release for these classes of prisoner will greatly help in reducing the sexual and violent crime figures. Similarly, removing any possibility of early release for offenders who have been imprisoned for any crime more than once would greatly help in reducing the overall level of crime in society.\n\nThe public are sick and tired of hearing of offenders committing offences when released early from prison. \n\nIt\u2019s time to be hard on these types of offenders. The public deserve protection.",
