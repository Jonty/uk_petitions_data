        "background": "As a Team member of McDonalds I have seen no recycling happen in the store I work in. McDonalds has started to encourage people to eat healthily, so why not make them recycle too? The paper bags they use, the straw paper, the boxes the food come in, the coffee cups, the list could possibly go on. It would be great to see some \"recycle bins\" in McDonalds. Possibly ones that are bright and colourful that kids can start to understand the importance of recycling.",
