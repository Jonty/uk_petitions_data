        "background": "Why should people be roaming our streets with their faces covered? A fairly recent development, and having checked with some westernised Muslim friends, more of a political than religious statement. My girlfriend is herself a Muslim, and has no problems whatsoever integrating into a modern Britain while balancing her religion, culture and upbringing with her lifestyle. I have a motorcycle and am required to remove my helmet when I enter a bank, post office, shop or a garage. CCTV systems are of no use. If I\u2019m flying into or out of this country I am required to show my face as a check to see that it agrees with my passport, if I was deaf how would I be able to lip read someone who\u2019s lips I couldn\u2019t see? Even within some Islamic countries the wearing of the veil is banned, because it is known that it is worn for political and radical reasons not religous, so why should we have to put up with it here in Britain? and the millions of pounds wasted in Court rulings - ban it",
