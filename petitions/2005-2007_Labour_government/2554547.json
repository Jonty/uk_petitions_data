        "background": "In principle, the idea of helping deserving people, without funds, defend themselves properly in Law is excellent. However the present system is abused by ridiculous compensation, human rights, and other claims. Some members of the legal profession stand to benefit from spurious legal action which not only wastes Tax Payers money but it clogs up our Legal System.\nI would suggest that legal aid is only available to those with no money, no assets and for criminal cases only.",
