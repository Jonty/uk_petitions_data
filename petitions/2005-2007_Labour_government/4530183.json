            "background": "Following Tony Blair's recent 'Am I Bovvered?' appearance on BBC's Comic Relief, with the Catherine Tate character, schoolgirl Lauren Cooper, I would like to petittion Mr Blair to make one of his public appearances after leaving office an appearance as the guest host of the BBC's satirical news quiz show: 'Have I got News For You'.\n\nIt was good to see the Prime Minister exercising a self-depeciating sense of humour and that he is clearly looking forward to the end of his Premiership and leaving the responsibilities of the office behind him. \n\nI would like to see MR Blair appear on the show and talk about politics in a TV show that reaches far more than the Sunday morning politics show. \n\nI believe that, apart from making TV history, Mr Blair will have an opportunity to defend himself and his Premiership and promote his legacy as PM. Appearing on the program will do more for his legacy and the public perception of him, than any lecture tour of North American Colleges.",
