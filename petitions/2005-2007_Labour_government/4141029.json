        "background": "Build a new public transport system that will service people travelling on the UK motorway network.  The service could provide for both short and long haul jouneys between termini at each motorway junction.  Each terminus could provide links into local bus, taxi and cycle routes.  Tailored services could be provided to meet peak rush hour demand for short haul commuter journeys.  Stops could be optimised to speed the service.",
