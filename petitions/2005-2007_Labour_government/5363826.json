            "background": "Digital Rights Managment (DRM) is a technology by which content distributors\ncan dictate what consumers can do with their content to the extent that, for\nexample, the PC that you own at home hides things from you, refuses to do\nsomething because it thinks you're trying to \"tamper\" with it, and potentially\nnotifies the content distributor of this action.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft Windows Vista is pushing this technology on users with\nvarious hardware manufacturers complicit in it including Intel, ATI, NVidia,\nS3 and Matrox.\n\nThis petition asks parliament to make it illegal for software to actively\ndisallow and subvert the operators intention even if it \"thinks\" that it\n\"might\" be illegal -- hardware is owned by the consumer and should remain such\nin the same way as cars do not disallow a driver to break the 70mph speed\nlimit on UK roads.",
