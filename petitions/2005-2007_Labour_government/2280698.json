            "background": "Portsmouths historic dockyard has served the local community for over 800 years. Closure will devasate the local community with the loss of up to 10,000 jobs. What is fish without chips and eggs without bacon...in that respect what will Portsmouth be without the Royal Navy. At a time when other naval bases in the area have closed or been downgraded (HMS Daedalus, HMS Dryad, HMS Mercury) why is this government intent on destroying Portsmouths link with the Royal Navy. Who can forget those images from the Falklands war when the local community pulled so hard together to protect and restore British Sovereignity in the South Atlantic? Please sign and protect our great heritage and local jobs. Thank you",
