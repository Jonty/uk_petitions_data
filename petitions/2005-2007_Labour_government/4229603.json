            "background": "Creationism should not be taught as fact in the modern world; for one thing there are many and diverse creation stories from different cultures (are they not equally valid), but the only ones we hear of provide little by way of testable theory (simply saying something  cannot be explained by other current theories is no argument for invoking an all-purpose intelligent designer).  The state has no business to be sponsoring education IN (not about) specific (and contradictory) faith doctrines.",
