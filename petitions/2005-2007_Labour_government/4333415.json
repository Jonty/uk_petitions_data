This policy of destitution is not working and failed asylum seekers then apply to local authorities to provide them with accommodation and subsistence payments. they only qualify for this help if they have needs over and above destitution. failed asylum seekers usually achieve this threshold by claiming to be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. The government should recognise that the cost of providing services to failed asylum seekers is impacting on services to the indigineous population and should reimburse local authorities for this failure in national asylum and immigration policy",
