It appears to me that lean sentences to relatively comfortable surroundings is not the answer.  I want the criminals to serve tough sentences, no television and complaints.  You should lose all privileges and rights whilst in prison.  It should be a place where no one wants to go, let alone return.  If this means building more prisons in the short term, so be it!  Come on middle England vote with your feet.  Champion the rights of the law abiding tax payer.",
