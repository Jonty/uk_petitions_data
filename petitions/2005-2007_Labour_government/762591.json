        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We need to have some kind of compulsory recycling system in this \"disposable\" society whereby people wishing to buy new furniture and household items etc... must \"trade in\" their old items. These items which are still usable could then be gifted or sold cheaply to needy families in their first homes who would then have items to \"trade in\" when they want to (and can afford to) buy new. We need to do something as all these items are currently going to the refuse dumps at an alarming rate, simply because of changed tastes, colour schemes or minor wear and tear. Obviously this wouldn't apply to electrical items due to Health & Safety Regulations. Something needs to be done to reduce consumerism and this throwaway trend!",
