            "background": "With the 10% income tax rate to be abolished in 2008 many of those who have been medically retired will see their tax bill double. \n\nMost of the Medically Retired will not  be eligible for Tax Credits and, because of their age, they will also miss out on any age related compensatory increase in Tax Allowance.\n\nThis doubling of their Tax Burden will hit hard as many of the Medically Retired have to get by on small pensions.\n\nIt cannot be Chancellor Brown's intention to penalise those on low incomes so let's bring our cases to his attention in the hope that he may come up with some way to help everyone in our situation.",
