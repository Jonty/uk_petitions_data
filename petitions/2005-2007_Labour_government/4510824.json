            "background": "We the British public beleive that the truth behind the war in Iraq has not been revealed. Under the freedom of information act and our right to a transparent goverment we want to know how many pro-zionist's assisted Tony Blair or coerced him into the war in Iraq. It is our intention to force the goverment to sponsor an independent investigation into the true motives of the war in Iraq, including financial incentives the British goverment might have received, not excluding the exoneration of the British debt towards America for world war one and two. The British public want to know details of the British debt towards the US, such as when and where the installments were truly paid and are there any receipts. Also, we want to know exactly what the motives were and where the proof is to back up those motives. The questions this investigation should answer are: is this discrimination against Arabs as the IRA never received this treatment, was this financially viable for Britain, have British people suffered financially because of this, was there a real justification, is there any proof of allegations against Iraq.",
