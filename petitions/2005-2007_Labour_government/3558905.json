            "background": "Fine levels for driving without insurance being significantly lower than the cost of insurance makes it attractive for some people to gamble on not being insured. If penalties where significantly increased to reverse this position ALL drivers would better off with valid insurance. Clearly driving without insurance being illegal in itself is NOT sufficient deterrent at present and fines should be significantly increased.  A simple figure would be a standard quote for third party insurance for the vehicle in question multiplied by 1.5.",
