            "background": "The logo revealed by Olympics 2012 yesterday has created a huge response from the people.This logo does not justify the Committee's expenditure of about \u00a3400000 to get it desinged. Poeple will be much happier to see a logo which shows landmarks of london or something to do with games or players.\nMoreover this logo has also triggered the fear of epileptic fits. Number of people have complained about it.Prof Graham Harding, who developed the test used to measure photo-sensitivity levels in TV material, said it should not be broadcast as It fails Harding FPA machine test which is the machine the television industry uses to test images.\n\nKeeping in mind all these facts,it my request to the Prime Minister to use his authority to ask 'Olympics 2012 Committe to change the logo",
