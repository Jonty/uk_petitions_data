            "background": "Whether you are a supporter or not of the congestion zone, that fact is, that residents in the zone have been tricked into believing that they would get a 95% discount. \nOn closer examination they have been forced to buy and pay for 5 consecutive days at a time. A single journey on one day will cost will cost \u00a34. This is not a 95% discount, but a bulk purchase discount. It is objectionable that departments of state should use such underhand marketing tactics when proposing new policies.\nWe have no objection to paying a min. amount of \u00a34 per transaction, but the days purchased should NOT BE CONSECUTIVE but usable ad hoc. \nThere is no valid reason to make the days consecutive other than revenue collection. In fact the policy as it stands encourages discount users to make the most days purchased and INCREASE CONGESTION.\nAll those affected ask that the \u2018Mayor of London\u2019 and \u2018Transport for London\u2019 change the policy for residents, so that the 95% discount is a REAL 95% discount.",
