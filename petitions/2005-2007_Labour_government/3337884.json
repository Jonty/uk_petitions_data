            "background": "It is difficult for anyone to understand why people would \"choose\" to be gay. At the end of the day we have no control over who we find attractive. Gay people even in 2007 still have to be subjected to vile abuse simply because they like the same sex and some people do not agree to their sexual practices. Gay people deserve and should have equal rights like any other individual. They should not have a trickle of rights here and there. It is wrong and unjust to deny freedoms that straight people have. I urge you to sign this petition that advocates equal rights. This would mean zero discrimination in public life on the grounds of sexual orientation, and to teach an awareness of homosexuality and homophoba in the classroom. This will limit AIDS and hate crime. If people are not taught that gay people exist and that they are subjected often to prjudist views, then the natural reaction is hostility. Please help bring an end to discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.",
