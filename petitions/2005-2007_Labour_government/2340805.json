        "background": "Ideas for road congestion....one car one family, there is no need for a household to have 2,3 4, or more vehicles. You can`t force people off the roads because public transport is so poor. This charge is just another way of the motorist feeding the tax coffers of the government.\n\nThis all boils down to the rubbish about global warming. This is not caused by excessive gases from motor vehicles, this is natural phenomina.\n\nIf our cars ran on water there would be no emissions, but then again there would be a `water tax`....people of the UK are such  foolish people that we accept all this nonsense.",
