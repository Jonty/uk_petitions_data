        "background": "These regulations prevent the public living of a sincerely Christian life by those for whom the Holy Scriptures are the rule for faith and practice. They introduce a new discrimination (against Bible-centred Christians) where there was previously a simple freedom of choice based on personal conscience as directed by God's Word. \n\nIn a country that claims to be Christian, and whose monarch has, by law, to uphold the Protestant (Bible-centred) Christian faith, this is clearly an unacceptable situation. Therefore we call upon the Prime Minister to remove this anomaly by rescinding these regulations.",
