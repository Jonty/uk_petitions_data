            "background": "The motorist is already heavily taxed through car tax, fuel duty, tolls and congestion charges.  If some or all of these charges could be seen to be subsidising the \"greener alternative\" (public transport), it would make such taxation more acceptable to the electorate.  It would also benefit everyone through improved public transport infrastructure and lower fares, encouraging greater use of the same (and hopefully reducing road congestion at the same time).",
