The Panda Bear which is native of China does not deserve to live in a cage which was deliberatly designed for monkeys. For more than 40 years Pandas have been imported and have failed to produce offspring and have consequently died. Ming-Ming, the current female panda was imported from China and was treat like property. Bao Bao was a gift from Berlin Zoo and has been passed form several Zoos now finally resting at London. This current state of Panda cruelty cannot continue.",
