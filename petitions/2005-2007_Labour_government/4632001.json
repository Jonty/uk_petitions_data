            "background": "A decision made only by political parties to use taxpayers money to fund their organisations amounts to a misuse of legislative power as it represents the interests of existing political parties only at the expense of the taxpayer.\n\nAlso, with a model where funding is provided in proportion to the number of votes cast in a previous election it unnaturally supports the ruling party and undermines the democratic process by making it difficult for small or new parties to compete against the incumbent parties as they are at a significant financial disadvantage.\n\nRather than free political parties from undue influence by its sponsors, state funding will provide parties with financial advantages not granted to an independent candidate.",
