Not civilian hospitals that do not understand the military way of  life or death. Our troops are being put in civilian hospitals that do not have the skills or specialists needed to treat personnel that have come to them from a combat zone. They need more than medical treatment.\n\nLets put a stop to the closing of our Military Hospitals and revitalize them or build new ones for our brave Men and Women.",
