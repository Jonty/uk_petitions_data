            "background": "I read in my paper that the average smoker takes a total of half-an-hour per day on these breaks; meanwhile the non-smokers just carry on working.  Not to penalise smokers in the way I have suggested effectively means that the non-smokers are subsidising them since they are doing more work for the same pay.  Even if my suggestion is brought in smokers will still have more time off than non-smokers due to absence caused by smoking-related illness.",
