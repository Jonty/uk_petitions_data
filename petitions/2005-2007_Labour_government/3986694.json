        "action": "enact legislation to ensure that the amount of time smokers take on their \"fag breaks\" at work is either made up by their staying later or deducted from their salary",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I read in my paper that the average smoker takes a total of half-an-hour per day on these breaks; meanwhile the non-smokers just carry on working.  Not to penalise smokers in the way I have suggested effectively means that the non-smokers are subsidising them since they are doing more work for the same pay.  Even if my suggestion is brought in smokers will still have more time off than non-smokers due to absence caused by smoking-related illness.",
