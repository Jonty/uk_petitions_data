            "background": "Education in Suffolk and other counties has been seriously affected by constant changes to education systems and by disruptive pupils being allowed to ruin the education of their classmates. \nThousands of young people have under-achieved and free adult training is mainly  I/T based, which is often unsuitable. It is virtually impossible to obtain funding  for courses such as animal care, plumbing and electrical work and they are not allowed to claim benefits whilst they train. Most remain unemployed or in frustrating jobs but the more determined take on Career Development Loans and commit themselves to serious debt.",
