            "background": "The 'Gaudi Style' shopfront installed in July 2004, has been welcomed by the majority of Muswell Hill's residents, who say it has greatly improved the look of the area. \n\nThousands of people have signed a petition addressed to Haringey Council saying that the new shopfront should stay, adding that the organic curvy lines of the new design, are far more in keeping with the Edwardian/Arts and Crafts style of Muswell Hill, than the very cold minimalist plate glass and stainless steel shopfronts that have been allowed nearby. \n\nWe call on the Prime Minister to intervene in this issue and stop Haringey Council from ordering the demolition of the much loved 'Gaudi Style' Shopfront and to ensure that it is granted planning permission instead.",
