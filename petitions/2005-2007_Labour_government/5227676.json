Now to add insult to injury, the so-called logo which is meant to inspire the world is unvieled, and that too falls short of it's promise.  It was no doubt sent for approval several times during development, surely someone must have thought \"I could get a four year old to do that for free\".  I don't want to pay for that rubbish, and hopefully a large number of you won't either.  Please sign up, and get your friends and family to as well.",
