            "background": "Our country is probably the only one that has encouraged Bank Holiday working for employees but it fails the employee who works for normal pay.\nThis also is true of employers who pay workers single time for weekend working.\nSurely the weekend is a valuable part of the week especially for parents with children so is a Bank Holiday, maybe if employers were made to pay reasonable rates for this there would be a decrease in the ammount of people working giving more quality time for all.\nMaybe the benefits of this could even bring better community spirit and less boredom for children keeping them away from crime.\nThe cultures on the continent are still respected fully and the benefits are clear for all to see.\nSaturday is worth at least pay + half.\nSunday at least double pay.\nBamk holidays at least Double time + day in lieu.(Treble time).",
