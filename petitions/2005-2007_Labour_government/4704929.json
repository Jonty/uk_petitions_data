        "action": "Investigate Microsoft Windows licence-fraud by OEM resellers.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many of the OEM licence-stickers attached to computers with preinstalled Microsoft Windows carry intentionally nonvalid numbers, and will not permit a reinstallation of the software should a fault develop in the computer. \n\nThis is likely to be the case even where the original and genuine OEM version of the software is used.\n\nThis supply of nonvalid keys is allegedly to prevent the copying and mis-application of the number from computers on display in stores. However, this will of course also prevent the genuine purchaser from using the licence to reinstall the software onto the original computer. \n\nWhatever the motives, we believe this sale and supply of invalid and nonworking licence-numbers constitutes fraudulent trading. \n\nOur opinion is that this practice falls into the same category of misdemeanour as the printing of any other kind of defunct or counterfeit bill, banknote, ticket or voucher. \n\nWe therefore petition the Government for a full and impartial investigation of this practice by the Office of Fair Trading.",
