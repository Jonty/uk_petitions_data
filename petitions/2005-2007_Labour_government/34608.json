The individual would be rated on a points system, dependant upon, age, previous illnesses, units of alcohol per week consumed, whether a smoker or non smoker, weight/height ratio and exercise undertaken. It would operate similar to car insurance with a discount for no claims. It would take a burden off the NHS which would continue to offer a basic service for those unwilling or unable to work. It would also encourage people to look after their health or pay a higher premium. Eventually a number of illegal immigrants would come to light who could be sent home.",
