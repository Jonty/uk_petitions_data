            "background": "Most mobile phones nowadays support video calls, so we propose that the police or crimestoppers should be equipped to receive and record them.\nIf the general public had the power to broadcast a criminal act live to the police where it is recorded as evidence submittable in court, people would be more inclined to intervene in violent crime by simply pointing their phone at an offender, and telling them \"smile, you're on live TV!\"\n\nThe perceived risk of being caught is more of a deterrent than any punishment, so if this was implemented and advertised on TV (complete with a catchphrase to shout!) it would act as a deterrent, make people feel safer on the streets, and also give people the power to stop a crime in progress.",
