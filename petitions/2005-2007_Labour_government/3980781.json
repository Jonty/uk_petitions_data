        "background": "I, like many others have been force fed since primary school that global warming is caused by rising co2 levels. Now, we are about to be taxed for our co2 emmissions through aviation taxes and car tax. However, a programme on channel 4 \"The great global warming swindle\" has opened my eyes to the possibility that global warming caused by co2 emmissions is wrong. Since this programme, it seems to have been buried by the news. I would like an independent team of scientists to investigate the theory of the sun driving global warming.",
