I want you to arrest,put on trial and then deport these anti British extremists. Legal action was taken against other extremist groups like the BNP. I say to you Prime Minister as the elected representative of the people you are charged with ensuring our ways of life and laws are upheld. It is not within your remit to have 'double standards' the loyalties of you and your cabinet are to the people who entrusted you with your office.",
