            "background": "With the current increase in living costs I feel it is wrong for schools to constantly send children home with letters begging for money in order to make up the shortfall in the school's funds just because schools do not receive enough money from central government.\nIt is hard enough for a lot of parents to meet the demands of day to day living expenses & for the schools to make children feel obliged to go begging to parents is wrong. This is no better than aggressive begging on the street with the stress it causes family's especially those on low incomes.\nI know a lot of the activities the schools provide to organise events to raise school funds are optional but this still creates added friction with families if children feel they can't take part in events. I propose that all schools should be given the monies they need to meet all their needs instead of imposing this stealth tax on parents. \nIt is good of schools to also want to raise money for charity aswell but again this is begging & causes the same results as the funding issue.",
