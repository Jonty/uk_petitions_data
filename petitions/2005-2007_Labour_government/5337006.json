            "background": "The push from the Franco/German axis for a federalised European state will continue until they succeed. UK policy has been to avoid confrontation but attempt to exempt itself in selected key areas. The original referendum on 1974 confirmed our country's intent to join an economic union. It is time that our politicians ask the electorate if the people of this country want political union. Until this question is answered in the affirmative, UK will always be at the periphery of the EU, and can never benefit and always risks loss. A negative response should result in withdrawal from EU preferably to the same status as that held by Norway and Switzerland.",
