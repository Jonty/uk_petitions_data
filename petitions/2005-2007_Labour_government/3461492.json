            "background": "Dog attacks are normally the fault of the owner. It's nothing to do with the breed. If a golden retriever is trained to be vicious, and attacks a kid, what happens if a nice pit-bull terrier comes to help the kid, and people will call the police, get the pit-bull destroyed, and give the golden-retriever a pat on the head and a doggy-biscuit. That's just like racism, because we expect a golden retriever to be friendly and a pit-bull to attack kids at every chance. It is not about the dog, its about the *owner*. Pit-bulls were originally trained to fight *bulls* in *pits*, see the name. They didn't want to be like that, someone made them like that.\n\nWe should jail the owners instead, they're to blame, not the dogs. Like, if you teach a small kid a swearword and say \"tell this to the teacher next week, she'll be really impressed\", its not the kids fault.\n\nDogs are meant to be man's best friend, so we shouldn't put them down for something we made them do.",
