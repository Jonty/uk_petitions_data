        "background": "The increasing problem of uninsured drivers could be drastically reduced by requiring insurance companies to issue insurance certificate discs for display in vehicles in the same way tax discs are. Every vehicle on the road is required to be insured whoever happens to be driving it at the time. At the very least it would display to the Police and the public that the vehicle was insured. It would also save Police time when trying to verify insurance details.",
