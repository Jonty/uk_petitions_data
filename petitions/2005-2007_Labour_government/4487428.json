            "background": "Just because someone has passed a driving test, it does not necessarily mean that they will be competent to drive for the rest of their life, and while they may not be directly be involved in a road traffic accident, they may indirectly cause one, as well as raising the stress levels of other road users who have to react to what can sometimes be very dangerous actions. This may not be down to actual driving ability; it can be simply from being unaware of updates to the laws of the road and the highway code. By introducing a retest or compulsory refresher training every decade or so, the roads could be made so much safer for us all.",
