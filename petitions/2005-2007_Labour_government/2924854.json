            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We had an issue with a local headteacher, unprepared to consult those who are involved in our sons special needs at school, making changes that would effect his education. Unmoved by the facts that legally he should consult all involved parties including parents. It was deemed necessary to pull our 3 children out of the primary school, they were off for 3 weeks, luckily, we managed to get them into another school (13 miles away), so we knock up 52 miles a day for this school run. The Local Education Authoristy stated the only course of action was the governing body, we went through them and they did nothing. So more power needs be from a higher position to stop this from happening again, and it should be the Local Education Authority. It sickens us to think this idiot is allowed to run a school in such a way, with arrogance, many parents are afriad of him after what he has done to others and yet he is still in control of a school.",
