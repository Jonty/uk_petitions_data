            "background": "Stop the requirement to sell family homes to finance care for the elderly. It is an unfair practice to penalize people who have worked hard all their lives in order to pay for their homes (and thus leave an inheritance for their families), those who have paid their National Health Insurance contributions with the expectation of being \u2018cared for\u2019 when they become ill. They may require 24 hour care which families cannot always provide due to a variety of circumstances.  To see the family home having to be sold, to finance this care as well as their State pension being taken in payment, is totally and utterly unjust and makes a mockery out of home ownership. What right does Government have to say \u201cbecause you are a home owner, you must sell your house to pay for your care\u201d.",
