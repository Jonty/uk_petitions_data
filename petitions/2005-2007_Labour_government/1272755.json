            "background": "eBay has chosen to ignore the fraud that is being committed through their on-line auction system. 1000's of FAKE MP3\\MP4 players are being sold to unsuspecting buyers worldwide.Players are being listed as having 2GB-8GB (Gigabyte) of storage capacity but in reality they have much smaller memory modules that have been hacked so that they read as larger than their true capacity.These memory modules can be as small as 128MB. Most buyers do not realize they have been scammed until it is too late.There have been no reports of authentic cheap no brand 4GB or 8GB chiPods as they are referred to. 2GB is reported as the maximum memory size supported however players as small as 512MB have been hacked.Many sellers advertise their items as being located in the UK, though in reality they are shipped from China.This practice defrauds not only buyers, but also HM Customs as no duty is paid on these items.Buyers are engaging in criminal activity,as they are liable for import duty on these goods",
