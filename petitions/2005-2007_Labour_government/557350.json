        "background": "Any job application requires you to disclose any unspent criminal records you may have. This puts the applicant at a disadvantage and are unlikely to be offered a position within any company if you disclose you have any. If you don't disclose then you can be prosecuted. I propose that this is removed from Job application forms apart from those jobs that involve the young or vulnerable. This will help ex offenders get employment, help them stop re-offending and reducing the load on the prison service.",
