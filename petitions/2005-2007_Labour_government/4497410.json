            "background": "The proposed \"carbon offset\" tax that county councils would be allowed to levy against barbecues should not be allowed for 4 reasons: \n1. Neither the principle nor the practice of carbon offsetting has been conclusively shown to be effective \n2. There is no guarantee that the cash raised will not be environmentally ringfenced\n3. A barbecue is a simple and innocent pleasure which should not be ruined by financial penalty\n4. The carbon saved is minimal as the food will simply end up being cooked in the kitchen: a process that generates CO2 anyway",
