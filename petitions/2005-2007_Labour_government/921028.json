        "background": "The NHS and other services are seemingly snowed under with targets, quotas and large amounts of paperwork.  Only today, 17/01/2007, I have heard that 14,000 patients in North Cornwall will be left without NHS dental care due to a practice closing down due to inability to meet NHS targets.  I have heard of similar things in other parts of the country as well.  We want Labour to scrap these targets in all areas in the interests of better providing for the community and the people of the United Kingdom.  We have them in many areas, and they are just a burden and a drain.",
