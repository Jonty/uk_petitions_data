Tag's are used to identify the dead and livestock.\nwhat happened to  good nursing care should involve some sort relationship with the patent!\nDo you want to know the actual truth about this? Pin back your ears ... it is connected to the govt wanting to know how much YOU cost to look after (remember, once you are bar coded, all time spent on you, bed days occupied by you, theatre time used by you, drugs used by you etc etc) can be 'charged' to your barcode). It's called 'patient level costing' and no-one except a select few seem to know about it.",
