        "background": "The clocks currently change from British summertime to wintertime at the end of October, 2 months before the shortest day. They change back to summer time at the end of March approx 3 months after the shortest day.\nI propose bringing the change to summertime in line with that to winter time by changing the clocks at the end of February when the daylight hours are similar to those at the end of October.\nThis would represent a small compromise to those who wish to scrap wintertime  altogether.",
