            "background": "I want the Government of Great Britian to allow Tul Bahadur Pun to be granted permission to reside here in Britain by giving him a place at the Royal Hospital Chelsea or a decent residential home.\n\nTul Bahadur Pun served 18 years in the British Army winning more than 10 medals including the Victoria Cross in 1944 for singlehandedly charging a Japanese position in Burma under heavy fire. He had an exemplary career risking his life in Malaysia, India and Hong Kong.\nHe now lives 16,000ft up the Himalayas in a hut with no roof, no running water or sanitation. He suffers poor eyesight and hearing and also has diabetes, high blood pressure, asthma and heart problems. If he and others are prepared to lay their life on the line for Queen and Country then they meet all the requirements to be allowed to enter and stay here in Britian.  \n\nI want the government to allow all Gurkha's to be given the rights not only to receive the same pension rights as a British soldier but to be allowed to live their life here in Britain after they finish their Military service.",
