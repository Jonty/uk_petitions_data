I propose then that this same technology can and should be utilised to give us REAL Democracy - Direct Democracy - whereby every adult legally resident in the United Kingdom can have a DIRECT  say in the running of this country. Representative \"government\" is a thing of the past, it is a relic of a time when communication was difficult. We no longer need people to represent us, especially when our so-called \"representatives\" so obviously, regularly and egregiously abuse their positions of elected (and inherited) power. No more! We can represent ourselves. Direct Democracy - NOW!",
