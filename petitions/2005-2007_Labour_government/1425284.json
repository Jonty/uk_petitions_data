No one is doing anything to help them.  We need more Police on the street with powers to arrest these people.  We need Magistrates with the power to punish them fully.  We need more prison space to accomodate them.  Minor offences can be punished by community service, the criminals can be used to sweep streets, clean graffiti etc.  This can be paid for by making efficiency gains across the board in Government.",
