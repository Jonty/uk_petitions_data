            "background": "I am 59 years of age and have just purchased a 124cc Motor Scooter. I use this for work and no longer suffer traffic jams consisting of 1 person per car going nowhere and burning up fuel. I propose that the government abolishes VAT on motor cycles, offers free road tax, free insurance, free lessons and test and free use of bus lanes outside London. If the government is serious about road conjestion and the reduction of carbon emission, this is a simple and cost effective way of doing it.",
