In 06/06 the Govnt launched a review of the facilities & facility time provided to workplace reps. The consultation document presents: \nWhether new methods of working at modern workplace seriously affect the ability of workplace representatives to function well; \nWhether the effectiveness & efficiency of workplace representatives can be enhanced in order to optimise the net benefits brought to employees, employers & society more generally.  In 01/07 the govnt issued its consultation, Workplace Reps: a review of their facilities and facility time. The consultation ends 29/03/07. Many consultation documents are not only sent to unions, the majority are sent to businesses. We urge the govnt to act following this consultation to protect & improve the current regs in relation to workplace, H&S & Union Learning reps.",
