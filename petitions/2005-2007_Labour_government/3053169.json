        "background": "92% of union reps feel that their careers have been sacrificed for helping members, many of these reps are on low wages, and become reps out of desire to help colleagues. In 06/06 the Govnt launched a review of the facilities & facility time provided to workplace reps. The consultation document presents: \nWhether new methods of working at modern workplace seriously affect the ability of workplace representatives to function well; \nWhether the effectiveness & efficiency of workplace representatives can be enhanced in order to optimise the net benefits brought to employees, employers & society more generally.  In 01/07 the govnt issued its consultation, Workplace Reps: a review of their facilities and facility time. The consultation ends 29/03/07. Many consultation documents are not only sent to unions, the majority are sent to businesses. We urge the govnt to act following this consultation to protect & improve the current regs in relation to workplace, H&S & Union Learning reps.",
