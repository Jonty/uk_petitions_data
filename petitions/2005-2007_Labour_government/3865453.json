They are in the community without precautions such as a Stab vest, Radio (communication), or safety training at all and this puts them at risk. The government should invest in giving these safety measures and training before someone gets killed or seriously hurt. They have no identificational pass of any type to identify themselves and where either the same or similar uniform to police officers, if police officers need all the safety stab vests and radios whilst in the public so do police cadets, this puts them at more risk than police officers.",
