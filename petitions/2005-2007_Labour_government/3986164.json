Increased Solar activity as seen in the past 30 years is causing the temperature rise. In addition humans CO2 production accounts for less than 2% of total atmospheric CO2 levels, decaying leaves produces 100 times more CO2 each year! In fact volcano's produce more CO2 than humans!STOP the CO2 nonsence now, its damaging both the UK and 3rd world economies!",
