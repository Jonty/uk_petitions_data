            "background": "It is a rare law that you have to pay to agree to obey. Most laws we have to obey just because they are the law. The problem with the DPA is that most of the effort goes into registration and the policing of registration rather than the core of the Act - Data Protection itself! Most people know about registration, and most registrants find the process pretty impenetrable. It is an unnecessary piece of bureaucratic clutter which stops people from concentrating on the real, very sensible issues that are behind all that!\n\nBy repealing the parts of the law creating the registration process, the Information Commissioner's Office can spend all their time making sure that everybody obeys the law, rather than chasing around over people who don't quite have the right clauses in their registration.",
