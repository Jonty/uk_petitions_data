            "background": "The government are in the process of closing one of our dockyards. I feel if there is to be a closure it should be one of those in Scotland. The history of the Royal Navy is the same history as Portsmouth Dockyard and England. \n\nBefore the Signing of the Union with Scotland The Royal Navy, Portsmouth and England were interlinked for 300 years+.\n\nThe Scots have a population of 5 million compared to Englands 53 million. If the scots get complete independence the nationalists want to close 2 bases anyway, so why pick on England?\n\nIs it because the defence secretary is scottish and wants to curry favour with the scottish electorate at the May elections and doesn't give us English any regard because we're not scottish?",
