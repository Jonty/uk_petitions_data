            "background": "The Forth Road Bridge is a vital link between Midlothian and Fife. The bridge carries 11 million vehicles a year - 4 times more than it was originally designed for. Without it, the counties of Fife and Perth & Kinrosshire will effectively be cut-off from Edinburgh. \n\nThe bridge has an ongoing structural problem with the main cables corroding. It is estimated that the bridge will be closed for heavy traffic by 2013 and possibly all traffic by 2020. A plan to stop the corrosion by fitting dehumidifiers will take 7 years for an assessment of its effectiveness \u2013 by then it will be too late!\n\nIf the bridge closes with no replacement, an economic disaster will occur. Company haulage costs, house prices, work forces, Kincardine bridge etc etc will all be adversely affected. \n\nIt will take at least 10 years to plan, construct and test a replacement bridge/tunnel. Thus, we must act now, make a decision on the future of the bridge, and ensure that a pending disaster is averted.",
