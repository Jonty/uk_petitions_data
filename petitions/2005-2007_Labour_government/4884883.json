In these instances the victim and family members are often subjected to further anguish and pain for sustained periods of time by having to endure almost daily contact with their attacker/s. \n\nIf you believe this to be discriminatory to the human rights of a victim and their family members and wish the current law pertaining to the release of perpetrator/s charged with violent crimes to be reviewed, sign this petition.",
