            "background": "This petition calls on the Prime Minister to arrange for the establishment of a working party, to include Muslim Clerics and Muslim community representatives, to produce guidance for those who follow Islam in the UK as to how the Koran should be interpreted and practised in 21st Century Britain. \n\nThis working party within its terms of reference should have regard to our traditional UK culture and confirm that our legal system does not recognise Sharia Law, enforced marriages, sexual discrimination, nor honour \u2018punishments,\u2019 each of which is totally alien to the British Rule of Law and the definition of \u2018acceptable behaviour\u2019 within the UK in the 21st Century.\n\nThis will ensure that there are no excuses offered for any misinterpretation by radical Muslims and thereby aid the majority of Muslims who are moderate to be just that, moderate, tolerant and understanding of their fellow inhabitants of this small island, regardless of their religious belief, or not, as the case may be.",
