            "background": "Due to the duty on bio fuel, manufacturers are finding it difficult to make a profit. This petition is asking the government to remove or substantially reduce the vat and or the duty from such fuel. \n\nThis would increase the number of suppliers (in what is a cottage industry), and make the product available to more of the public.\n\nThe benefits are huge; action now could have an immediate effect on pollution. People who need to drive four wheeled drive, or any Bio-fuel powered vehicles should also be given a road fund rebate as an incentive to use these fuels, as their vehicle will then be cleaner than the cleanest mineral fuelled car.\n\n1.\tReduce duty on Bio-Fuel.\n2.\tReduce Vat on Bio-Fuel.\n3.\tProvide a road fund rebate for people who can prove that they use only Bio-Fuels.\n4.      Offer incentives to small producers, increased use of bio fuels will help our farmers.\n\nThe benefits are huge, for our children.\n\nDominic M\u2019Benga, York.",
