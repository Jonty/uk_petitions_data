            "background": "Sir,\nI have never felt so strongly about a subject in my life, as I do about the lack of response from the Portuguise Authorities in the Maddie McCann case.  I understand, as do a lot of British people that they are unable to give us a lot of information, but the little that we are being given leads to the question of \"what is being done, if anything\" about bringing this little girl back to her family.  Why can our government not insist that more is done to help in this fight for her? You NEED to insists that the Porgual authorities accept our help. I believe that the population as a whole feel very strongly that not enough is being done about this, and I think this is what makes it all the more frustrating. Please help to bring Maddie home.",
