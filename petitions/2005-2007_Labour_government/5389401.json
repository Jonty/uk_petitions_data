            "background": "I have worked in schools for last 5 years and I have found at times it to be unsatisfactory. I have worked with some lovely people whom I have met and who have never been appraised in years! I would like to see the Government make it compulsory for Headteachers to appraise, review and offer training to school admin staff as operated in other Local government jobs or private sector. School admin staff are undermined and often perform tasks outside of their job description without recognition. It would be nice to see besides teaching staff receiving training days & pay reviews, that admin staff equal this as well. Also that inspectors check to see this has been performed.",
