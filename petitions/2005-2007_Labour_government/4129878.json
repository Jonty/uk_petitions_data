            "background": "The Aston Villa v Liverpool game on 18th March 2007 was, without question, one of the worst football matches ever played in the history of the great sport.  A game totally devoid of any incident, excitement or attacking intent from either side.  As such, I feel it is the responsibility of both clubs, who sent out teams with horribly negative tactics in order to ruin the game as a contest, to give a full or partial refund to all paying spectators after they were robbed of an afternoon's entertainment which they had paid to see.",
