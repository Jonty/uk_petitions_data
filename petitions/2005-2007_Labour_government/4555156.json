            "background": "Many people suffering a bereavement receive mailings or telephone calls from catalogue companies, loyalty card schemes, book clubs etc. for the deceased that are almost impossible to stop. They provide a number to place orders, or a return if undelivered address but calling or writing to these do not stop the mailings. This is very distressing, particularly to partners of the deceased. One British High Street  Store provide a number for a call centre in India to take orders and an agent who demanded to speak to the deceased  before they would cancel the store card and stop the mailings.",
