            "background": "The Chancellor in his Budget of 21 March 2007 abolished the 10 percent lower-rate of income tax, pertinent to incomes not exceeding \u00a315,000 per annum.  This will also affect everyone in receipt of a pension including old age pensioners. In effect, this has increased my income tax level by 100 percent and is an affront to those who are not in a position to earn anymore.",
