            "background": "bureaucatic pressure!\n\nThe amount and complexity of the targets and monitoring of objectives by government hinders the acheivement of these objectives. Targets are also frequently unrealistic and under-resourced. \n\nExamples include: equality impact assessment - a new requirement set out under the discrimination acts that asks all public sector organisations to review \"all policy and procedure, formal and informal, written and unwritten, for potential discrimination\".\n\nProblems:\n1. If you did this, you would need to shut down all public services to conduct a full review.\n2.It is practice not policy that matter, work is DONE by people.\n3. There are no further resources for public sector to carry out this activity or to follow the needs identified.\n4. Only civil servants care about these numbers.\n5. Bureaucrats could work in partnership with practitioners to set realistic and useful targets and resource action taken to meet them. \n\nSpend on the sector, the end user, not the bean counters!\n\nthanks!",
