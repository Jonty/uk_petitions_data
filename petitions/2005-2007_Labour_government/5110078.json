            "background": "Organised religion is by definition divisive. Societies have been riven by sectarian violence and dissention throughout history and religion has offered nothing but a continuation of their own repressive agendas in response through violence, torture and coercion. Logic and science dictate that all religions are based on a fundamentally flawed precept. Therefore adherence to this precept is fundamentally useless, a waste of time and its promotion is essentially immoral. Therefore indicating one's allegience to any religion whether by symbolic jewelry or dress must also be immoral. Therefore we, the undersigned press this and future governemnts to ban the use of dress, symbology, jewelry or publication to promote the divisive, sectarian and immoral agenda of all religions within the UK.",
