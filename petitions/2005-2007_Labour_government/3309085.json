            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In order to reduce the risk of serious accidents involving young inexperienced drivers, there should be a compulsory \"P\" plate to replace the \"L\" plate on  passing the driving test. This would indicate to other road users that a) the driver has passed the driving test  b) the driver is young  c) the driver is inexperienced.\nThe \"P\" plate would only be available on \"lower-powered\" cars, say less than 1.2 lt.\nAt the end of 2 accident free years,  a further test could be taken and then the restriction could be lifted.\nIf a culpable accident occurs then consideration would be given to extending the duration of the P-plate.\nAnyone who should be on P-plate use and caught driving without would have their licence withdrawn and would need to be put through the standard test again.",
