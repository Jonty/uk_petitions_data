            "background": "Under European law, all HGVs are speed-limited to 90kph (56mph). However, not all speed-limiters are equal and this results in a 56mph moving roadblock as one HGV overtakes another with only a 0.5 mph speed differential between them.\nBy preventing HGVs from overtaking on motorways and dual carriageways, a major source of restriction would be removed resulting in a more constant speed for the remainder of traffic. This would reduce congestion, decrease travel time and decrease vehicle emissions.",
