            "background": "The Second Severn Crossing has the highest toll per mile of any bridge in the UK.\n\nThe toll is an unfair burden on businesses and residents in Wales and places them at a disadvantage to other areas of the country.\n\nAny argument that the bridges would not have been built without the tolls is without substance. Far more has been spent in recent years repairing the M5 bridge over the Avon and widening the M25. Current plans to widen the M1 are not subject to the introduction of tolls to finance the work.",
