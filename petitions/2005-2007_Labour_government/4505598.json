            "background": "People living in the UK in receipt of benefits are falling deeper into poverty because benefits are no longer linked to wages! \n\nGordon Brown has made a pledge to eliminate child poverty by 2020. Benefits need to be raised in line with wages rather than prices to help eliminate poverty in low income, workless households and those households in receipt of incapacity and sickness benefits. A failure to do so will push millions of households across the UK further into poverty and debt. \n\nIf benefit levels were linked to average wages each benefit applicant would recieve at least \u00a330.00 per week more.  The UK has one of the lowest ratios of benefits to average earnings in Europe! We cannot allow this poverty trap to continue year on year. This flawed policy needs to change NOW!",
