            "background": "In its use of grain from the third world to feed british cattle, we are depriving equal human beings their absolute right to life. The government should be strong and ignore its fear of loss of the farming electorate, in view of the absolute devestation that has been happening in underdeveloped nations for hundred of years. One field used to graze cattle is a waste of increasingly precious space and human resources. Invest in harvests of grain, expand the range of vegetarian products, market the vegetarian diet in its true light and cease to deny Africa the basic human right to food. After all Mr Blair, greed is also one of the seven deadly sins.",
