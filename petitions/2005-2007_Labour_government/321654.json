        "background": "As a person with a disability and through no choice of my own i also have to claim for Incapacity Benefit. I have been deemed unfit to work by the Governments own medical examiners.\nThe reason for my petition is that while i am deemed unfit to work i still have to pay for my monthly prescriptions. These currently stand at 13 seperate item every month. Therefore over \u00a3100 of my state benefit goes toward my medication. If however i was idle and couldn't be bothered to get out of bed to go to work i would get everything handed to me on a plate. This is surely wrong in this day and age.\nPlease show your support for this petition.",
