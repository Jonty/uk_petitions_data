        "background": "The British people already pay very high levels of general taxation.  The costs of \u00a315,000 to \u00a320,000 pounds per student for 3 years which recent changes have imposed are intrinsically unfair. Parents are often in their 50's or 60's and are moving towards retirement, sometimes with pensions which are inadequate due to government negligence over the years.  Accommodation in  University towns is often squalid, over-crowded and extortionate because the government has chosen to allow a free market in the rented sector. Make University costs tax free!",
