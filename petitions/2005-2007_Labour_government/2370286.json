            "background": "The police force waste many hours attempting to apprehend minor offenders who skip bail, have arrest warrants issued or escape prison.\n\nThis job could be handed over to private companies who after training become licensed Bounty Hunters.  These companies will earn fees for each offender captured and turned over to the authorities and these fees will be recovered from the offender where possible.\n\nThe introduction of Bounty Hunters will save taxpayers money and free up vast amounts of Police time so that they can concentrate on their real job of fighting crime.",
