            "background": "In the UK, everyone is desperate to prevent global warming through reduced carbon dioxide emissions. Measures have been implemented to try to persuade people to use public transport, but it is too expensive. I propose that a maximum price on Buses and other public transport would encourage a greater use of these systems, as the cost would become significantly lower, reducing carbon emissions and making everyone's life easier, and cheaper.",
