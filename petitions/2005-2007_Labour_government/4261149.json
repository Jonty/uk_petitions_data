            "background": "All the essentials of life are charged by volume, weight, duration or capacity i.e. how much you use it.\nThe goverment needs to ensure council tax is levied in the same way.\nThe tax should be based right to vote.\nThe tax should be charged to the property owner.\nWhere a property is rented out landlords collect the money from the tennent of the property. \nThe problem with the current scheme is that it is not related to the ability to pay. Pensioners and those on a fixed income who were thrifty so as to buy their house are penalised. Some are forced to sell their homes to make ends meet. Even the estate agent charges by percentage.\nBy moving to a scheme where individuals who use council services are registered and pay a charge there are many benefits. Principly in sharing data between government depts. \nReducing fraud, (passports, benefit claims, national insurance, illegeal immigration, car licenses and most of all prisoners who evade custody). This could increase the prospect that ID fraud can be contained.",
