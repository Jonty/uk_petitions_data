        "background": "Fred Trueman was the greatest English fast bowler in history. He gave many years' service to broadcasting and charity after his retirement from the game. He was a great character and wit, a patriot and real Yorkshireman. \n\nHe was never adequately honoured during his lifetime, probably because he refused to be told what to do and say, and never gave a penny to New Labour.\n\nThe failure to honour Fred Trueman during his lifetime must be corrected now.",
