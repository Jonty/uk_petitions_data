        "background": "I am sick of hearing people moaning about how 'easy' we young people have things, because we don't. We come out of uni with massive debts brought on by unfair tuition fees and then have average house prices 10 times our starting salary, and I live in the North West. I think it is about time the Government did more to help us get on the property ladder.",
