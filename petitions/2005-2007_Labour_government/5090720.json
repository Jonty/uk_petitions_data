            "background": "At present it is far too easy for house-sellers to pull out and renege on accepted offers, without good reason. The rate at which house prices currently rise means that sellers can make more money by monitoring the market, pulling out and re-selling it at a later date and higher price. At present buyers stand to lose large amounts through wasted surveying and solicitors fees and this must change to ensure a more even playing field.\n\nScottish law does not allow this and it is time that our law was brought into line with what is a much fairer system.\n\nThankyou.",
