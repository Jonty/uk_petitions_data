            "background": "By removing all current forms of road tax and replacing them with an additional tax on fuel, you are affectively achieving a fair pay as you go scheme.  Although this does not deal with reducing congestion on particular roads it allows a fair tax for those that use their car infrequently and for those that use it a lot.  It also ties in tax to the efficiency of a car, which may be an aid to cutting pollution.",
