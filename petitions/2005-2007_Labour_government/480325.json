        "background": "If anyone with a DES Teacher Pension wishes to implement pension sharing with their spouse after divorce, then Capita (a private company who adminsters the civil service scheme) will charge over \u00a3900. Most companies charge nothing for this service. \n\nCapita, with Government and Union blessing are imposing a hefty charge in order to reduce a pension, typically by half. The admin costs are minimal - there is no justification for imposing such a charge. This facility has previously been administered by civil servants, for whom we already pay taxes. \n\nUnions - supposed to be acting for their member's interests - seem to have voted for this charge without a murmur.",
