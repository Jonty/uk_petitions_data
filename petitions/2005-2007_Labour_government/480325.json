Most companies charge nothing for this service. \n\nCapita, with Government and Union blessing are imposing a hefty charge in order to reduce a pension, typically by half. The admin costs are minimal - there is no justification for imposing such a charge. This facility has previously been administered by civil servants, for whom we already pay taxes. \n\nUnions - supposed to be acting for their member's interests - seem to have voted for this charge without a murmur.",
