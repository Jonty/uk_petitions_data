Yet we are constantly having new taxes (eg \"the green tax\") being imposed upon us to pay for the Government's wasteful policies.  Local taxation rises every year but services are being cut.  We simply can not afford to pay the colossal sums needed to fuel the Brown/Blair egos and pay for the Games.",
