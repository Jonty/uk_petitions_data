            "background": "I have read through the proposals for the new West end development plans. There are many suggestions for making it safer for shoppers. That whole area is incredibly dangerous for cyclists and I want a firm commitment within the plans that cycle lanes, and I mean lanes not painted lines on the road will be one of the highest priorities. It is time cyclists in this city were rewarded for improving congestion and air quality rather than the joke of what is in place at the moment, no amount of green paint keeps a lorry's wheels out.",
