            "background": "Single parent families have had to put up with discrimination from all directions: faith leaders, employers, schools and the government. There is NOT a higher average of children from single parent families failing in school or in jail. Only a small minority of lone parents are un-employed and are on state benefits, the majority are employed.  We wish that the government would realise this and bring in legislation stating that discrimination against single parent families is NOT allowed and to amend their policies to accommodate this. Also we wish the government to sort out the Child Support Agency so lone parents can have financial support equivalent to that of two parent families.",
