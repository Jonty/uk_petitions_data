        "background": "Typical carbon offset programmes claim that offsetting carbon production from privately owned cars can be done at a cost of around \u00a325.\n\nThe \"typical motorist\" was defined to be someone who \n\ndrives his/her car in such a way that it averages 35 mpg, and drives 10,000 miles per year.\n\nThe CO2 produced is estimated at 3 tonnes.\n\nHowever, 10,000 miles / 35 mpg = 286 gallons or thereabouts.\n\nIf petrol is about \u00a34 a gallon (so we're only paying \u00a33 or 300% tax on it) the tax charged is \u00a3858 or thereabouts.\n\nAs it only represents 0.03% of the revenue raised, could the government please lead the way on CO2 emissions offsetting by spending \u00a325 out of this \u00a3858 on offsetting the carbon produced by \"typical\" motorists ?",
