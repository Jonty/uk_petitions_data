            "background": "Friedman was the most influential economist of the second half of the 20th century\u2026possibly of all of it.  He made major contributions to the fields of macroeconomics, microeconomics, economic history and statistics while advocating laissez-faire capitalism. In 1976, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Economics for his achievements in the fields of consumption analysis, monetary history and theory and for his demonstration of the complexity of stabilization policy.  In 1962, Friedman wrote 'Capitalism and Freedom', which  advocated minimising the role of government in a free market as a means of creating political and social freedom. In his 1980 television series 'Free to Choose', Friedman explained how the free market works, emphasising that its principles have shown to solve social and political problems that other systems have failed to address adequately.  His views of monetary policy, taxation, privatisation and deregulation influence government policy across the globe from the US to the UK. His ideas were studied throughout the world.  Without Friedman, the world would be less free. Sign the petition if you value liberty and the right to choose.",
