            "background": "I'm starting this petition to stop touts buying tickets and then selling them at vastly inflated prices, which is therefore stopping genuine fans being able to buy tickets at reasonable prices. The only touting that is illegal at present is that of tickets for football matches, due to hooliganism. Even Wimbledon Tennis tickets obtained through the national ballot are not allowed to be re-sold. If touts were stopped altogether, and sites such as eBay, stopped the sale of tickets for ridiculous prices, and if they must, only allowed the sale of tickets for nothing more than their face value plus incurred booking fees, people would have a fairer chance of being able to purchase tickets for events. Touting for the Olympics tickets for 2012 is set to be made illegal, so why can\u2019t this be made applicable to all events?  It shouldn\u2019t matter what event a ticket is for, there should be a blanket ban on all forms of touting. Let's stop satisfying someone else's greed.",
