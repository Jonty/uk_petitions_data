To do this it will have to overturn or ignore two High Court Judgements allowing the Chagossians the right to return.  This is in spite of Home Secretary Robin Cooks position of not contesting the decision to allow repatriation in 2000.\n\nIt seems the continuing ''War on Terror'' allows for the contiued theft of these Islands, simply for their strategic position in relation to the Gulf and any future campaigns.",
