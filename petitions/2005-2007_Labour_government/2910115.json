        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently I attend an Integrated school, the teachers must be the most caring, kind and considerate of all. The only thing stopping students at my school reach their full potiential is lack of funds for educational equipment to assist in the delivering of the syllabus. We have old O.H.P while state funded schools have interactive whiteboards, personally this i find very bias. In Northern Ireland their has been a big divide through secterianism, people not seeing eye to eye, but in recent years Integrated Schools have flurished BUT with very poor funding for building development and classroom equipment. I want this to change, to help future genberations learn together with the best possible facilities and equipment. Please sign.",
