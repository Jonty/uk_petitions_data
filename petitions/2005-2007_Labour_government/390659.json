            "background": "Hello and welcome to my petition. This petition is to petition the government into getting the laws changed around child protection, care proceedings and secrecy in the family courts. \n\nThe objectives of this petition is as follows.\n\n(a) To stop the barbaric removal of babies at birth just because their mother or parents have a child in care all ready. This is a significant abuse of human rights for the mother and the baby. \n\n(b) To petition the government into opening up the family courts. Too many children are being removed from their parents on a \"balance of probability\". The system as it is now is depriving vulnerable children of a relationship with their parents. \n\n(c) To take some of the power away from social services departments. Many UK social services departments prey on vulnerable families. We need a system where they can't go removing a child UNLESS it has been proven in the criminal court that a child has been harmed. \n\nFreebird",
