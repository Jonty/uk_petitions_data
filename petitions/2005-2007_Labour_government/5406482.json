            "background": "As you will see from today's news (26.06.2007), Quentin Davies has switched from Conservative to Labour.  His constituents would have voted for him to represent them as a Consevative MP - not as a Labour MP.  It seems unfair that he can continue as an MP until the next General Election to find out if his constituency still support him.  I believe this may not be the case, and feel that any MP who switches party should stand for re-election in their constituency immediately, to see if they still have the support of the electorate",
