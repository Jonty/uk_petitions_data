            "background": "Due to the fact that Sky has doubled the cost of its non-premium channels Virgin Media Customers are to lose them on Thursday 1st march 2007. This is just one more battle in the war between Virgin Media & Sky for control of UK digital TV but this time Virgin Media customers are the casualties. We are set to lose Sky News, the Sports Channels and some of the most popular programmes on digital TV: Battlestar Galactica, Lost and 24. This is manifestly unfair. We don't support either side in their bids for supremacy and we believe that there is a need for more regulation to ensure that consumers are not abused in this way.",
