            "background": "Far too many times have I lifted up the paper or turned on the television or radio to hear of another young British soldier tragically killed as a result of the bloodshed in Iraq. It sickens me to see British Army recruitment targeting the schools in under-privileged and working class areas, glamorising the image of the armed forces and snapping up prospective soldiers that are still only children. Having experienced first-hand what it is like to grow up in such a place, I realise that due to their often criminal surroundings, and the poor education that they receive due to the class-ism which has always been an underlying issue in this country, that these children often have little or no other choice of career. As a member of the British working class youth and as a human being it saddens me to the point of tears to know that this issue is being overlooked and denied by both the British government and public.",
