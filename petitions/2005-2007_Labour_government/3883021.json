With DVB boxes available from just \u00a320 the upgrade is within reach of everyone.\n\nAreas with full digital reception should have the analogue signal switched off now.  Areas where digital cannot be commissioned until analogue is removed should also be converted now.  Everywhere else should aim to be transmitting digital at full power by the end of 2008.\n\nThe public have embraced digital television much quicker than expected, so lets bring the switchover dates forward.",
