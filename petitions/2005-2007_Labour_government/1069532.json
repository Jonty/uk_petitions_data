Many of us are qualified and believe that we can give our children the best education possible, while teaching them to be good and proud citizens of Britain.  We are a peaceable people and want only that our children not be distracted by the trappings of many things that go on in the public schools (drugs, sex, etc.) that prevent kids from being their best - in academics and in personal character.\n(This is not to be negative about the established school systems' education - but the school cannot control the kinds of people that attend their or the ways that they have been raised).",
