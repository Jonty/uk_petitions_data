        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "following the recent program on ITV 999 Lotery (Tonite with Trevor Macdonald)it has come to light that in many parts of the United Kingdom people are not receving the best care possible. Instead of a qualified paramedic atending the scene, a less qualified an EMT (Emergancy Medical Technition is being sent. This has lead to tragic results in where threw no fault of there own the EMT's are not able to administer the requred drugs or  perform the procedure needed in order to give the patient the best clinical care available.  Also i wish to petition to disolve the 8 minite rule as this is also not in the patients best interests, altho it means they will try to have ambulance personel on scene quickly they will send the closets unit who may not be trained to the scene to meet this target.  This means a paramedic in a fast response car may not be sent becouse they will not arive in that time.",
