            "background": "The Payment of Wages Act 1991 repealed the Truck Act of 1831-1896.\nIt was alleged by the then government that workers wages were safer being paid by cheque or into a bank account, rather than in 'Coin of the Realm'.\nSince that date the majority of workers have been forced, to suit employers and banks, to have there wages paid directly into a bank. \nThis also applies to pensions and those on benefits.\nIt now apears certain that, despite recording billions of pounds in profits, banks are to impose charges on bank accounts.\nThis appears to be an indirect imposition of the 'Truck'.\nWith the repeal of the Payment of Wages Act 1991 all persons, so inclined, will be able to have wages, pensions and benefits paid, again, in 'Coin of the Realm'.\nThis will also allow all to make an informed decison on whether they wish to hold bank accounts.",
