            "background": "I believe that the health and safety of our nation demands a household refuse collection at least weekly - in the summer months perhaps more frequently. Nobody wants our citizens, especially children, the elderly and vulnerable groups to endure unpleasant odours, a risk of disease, or the discovery of maggots or rats as a result of their waste not being collected. It\u2019s also a false economy from a Council Tax payer\u2019s viewpoint, as I suspect that fly tipping will increase as a result of infrequent waste collection. Sign up if you agree!",
