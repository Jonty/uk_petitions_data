            "background": "Currently the UK wastes 2 thirds of the electricity it generates in transmission alone, via a rapidly ageing centrailsed power grid.  Having recently just watched the documentary \"what are we waiting for?\", I was alarmingly awaken to this shocking waste of ever more expensive fossil fuels.  Many of our european partners have been perfecting the use of small/medium scale CHP schemes, bio fuels and greater use of renewables.\nMany of which give 95 percent efficiency compaired to our best which is 35 percent.  This would reduce the carbon emmisions and give us more time before fossil fuels run out.  The current view in the UK seems to be the need for more energy via nuclear instead of using what we have more efficiently.  \nGreen taxes on luxury gas guzzling vehicles, in-efficient fuels, and long distance flights.  Part of the money generated could be used towards more grants to incorporating renewables into homes and offices than is currently.",
