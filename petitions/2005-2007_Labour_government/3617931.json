            "background": "EU Radio Amateurs are allowed up to 1000 watts output, this causes extreme interference to others on the band.\nThe rest of the EU should therefore REDUCE their maximum power levels to 400 watts, which is the maximum allowed in the UK.\nThis would make contesting more equal  and cause less interference on the amateur bands in general.\nIt is possible to work the world on less than 5 watts so high power levels are unnecessary.",
