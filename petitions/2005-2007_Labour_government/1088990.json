            "background": "One good reason to really enjoy life is that one day we will be dead.No physician can actually \"save\" any patients life so we need to clarify our language and lower NHS expectations.  Death makes room for the wonders of the next generation so it has a strong positive side. \nWe need education to be responsible for our diet and exercise but also to teach that life is not fair, and we cannot choose our genes or tell our mother to stop smoking during pregnancy. The NHS has a smaller role in a British person's well-being than other factors. However, healthcare is taking an increasing share of our countrys resources. You pay taxes to the NHS instead of education, transport, and scientific research which directly improves our lives today and rescues us from ecodisasters in the future. \nHealthcare must be rationed: no unfortunate individual should take a disproportionate share. Basics should be available forever, but expensive drugs & surgery should be limited to 100000 pounds.",
