We are always being told by the Government that we should be doing our bit to cut down on fuel emissions but exactly where is the incentive when you have buses (and trains) that hardly ever show up, infrequent services, dirty carriages and anti social behaviour going on all around you? Come on Mr Blair it's time to do something about this.",
