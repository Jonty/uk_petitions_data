            "background": "Time and again I read reports in my paper of accidents caused by banne drivers and yet these drivers only seem to incur punishments or penalties in respect of the accident they hsve caused.  If they are banned from driving surely they are committing an offence by continuing to drive yet nothing seems to happen about THAT.  In some cases I've read about individual drivers have been banned for numbers of times in double figures! e.g. for one driver it was 37 times! It's obvious to me that some drivers simply ignore their ban and continue driving with impunity.",
