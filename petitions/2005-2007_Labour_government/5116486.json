            "background": "Increasing the age from 16 to 17 stopped many people taking the motorcycle test.\nEither reduce the age for motorcyle licences back to 16 or allow car licence holders (eg more than 5 years) to drive motorcycles.\nSimilarly, the HGV licence is far too expensive.\nHowever, most people only need a weight limit of 7.5 tons (car and trailer, car and horsebox, car towing another car). This should be included automatically in any car licence (at the time of the test and certainly after having held a licence for five years)",
