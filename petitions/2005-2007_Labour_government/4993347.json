Why is this the case? It is not as if the BBC is airing any other shows of value. I for one will be reluctant to give my license fee to fund programs like Doctor Poo & Joseph and his Techni Colored Dream Sh*te when wee could be experiencing the TV extravaganza that is Superstars with the lovely Suzi Perry.",
