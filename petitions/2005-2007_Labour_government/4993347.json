        "background": "Superstars\" The legendary TV program which has seen such highlights as a Permed Kev Keegan eat Tarmac and suffer horrific skin burns after falling from his Raleigh Racing bike only to get back on it and qualify & Brian Jacks dominate the Gym test - Has been off air for far too long? Why is this the case? It is not as if the BBC is airing any other shows of value. I for one will be reluctant to give my license fee to fund programs like Doctor Poo & Joseph and his Techni Colored Dream Sh*te when wee could be experiencing the TV extravaganza that is Superstars with the lovely Suzi Perry.",
