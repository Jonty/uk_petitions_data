Yet we know that breast is best for the health of mother and baby.\n\nWhat we need is an environment where women are comfortable with feeding their baby anywhere and at any time. We need to create an atmosphere of support from friends, family, partners and health professionals. The more vocal this support the stronger the encouragement to new mothers to take up and carry on breastfeeding their infant.\n\nWe call on the Prime Minister to take a public role in promoting National Breastfeeding Awareness Week 2007, 13 to 19 May, for the good of the nation.",
