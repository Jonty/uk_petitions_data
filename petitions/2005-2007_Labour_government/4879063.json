            "background": "The additional time contraints that marriage imposes on the average working housewife often means that Pubic topiary may sometimes become lapse and almost non-existant. This can sometimes lead to lack of libido on behalf of the husband as his wife becomes less sexually attractive to him. The knock on effect is that this puts strain on a marriage and may often lead to the husband straying, ultimately resulting in the marriage falling apart, difunctional families being formed resulting in feral children wandering in hoodie gangs carrying out unsociable behaviour. Therfore the community as a whole will suffer as a result of the failure to wax-on-wax-off every few days.",
