        "background": "We wish for the ban of reality TV shows as it has spoiled TV viewing and the people of such shows spoil TV with bad language. TV shows should be entertaining and fun for all the family, shows to make people laugh again and not switch off. We pay for the licence so we should have our say and make TV channels bans these from main line TV. Give them their own channel & if people wish to watch pay per view so this is not on the licence fee. The people of the shows go no where, if they do it's not for long. Let\u2019s have real entertaining TV by real entertainers.",
