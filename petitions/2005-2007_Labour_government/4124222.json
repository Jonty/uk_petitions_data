            "background": "Many people, including the Govt., are aware of the benefits that interactive whiteboards and other technologies, have brought to the classroom.  Yet there are all sorts of degrees of deafness in children, who are being denied this simple aid because of lack of funding, resources, and a lack of knowledge of the LEA.  Many of us enjoy surround sound systems on our home tv systems, or conference facilities for presentations at work, while deaf children in classrooms are not given the same support.",
