Children under the age of 18 are taken away from families and subjected to torture, interrogation, physical beatings, deplorable living conditions and no access to fair trial, according to reports by human rights groups and legal observers.\n\nAccording to the latest figures offered by an independent group, there are 398 Palestinian children currently inside Israeli detention centres and prisons.\n\nPalestinian children in the Israeli prison system are not given any legal advocacy and are denied most of their rights, involved lawyers say.\n\nwe are lucky in this country that we are not subjected to these conditions but when you hear things like this it breaks your heart.\n\ni hope that the government would take action on this petition.",
