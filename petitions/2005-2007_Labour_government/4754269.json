            "background": "London Borough of Lewisham, the Council which funds Community Education Lewisham, wishes to impose drastic cuts in CEL's funding. This would mean the closure of Holbeach Adult Education centre in Catford, as well as other cuts to CEL's service. This would adversely affect the community, preventing access to education for single and working mothers and the unemployed in the Catford area. Alternative services are either too far away or would involve greater cost.",
