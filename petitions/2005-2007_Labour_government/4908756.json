        "background": "The South East region of the UK Youth Parliament firmly believes that the voting age should be reduced to 16. As our main regional campaign, this aim will be the focal point over the next year. \n\n   There has been enthusiastic support and encouragement from local MPs who have embraced the campaign and local events to promote the campaign are shaping up to be very successful. These will be extended nationally to raise awareness of the importance of 16 year olds being granted the privilege of voting for their Government. \n\n   Lowering the voting age to 16 is an essential step to ensuring that young people have an active role in democracy. With more support for the campaign, both from youth and adults alike, D/MYPs for the South East are optimistic that votes at 16 will be achieved in the near future.",
