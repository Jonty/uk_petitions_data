        "background": "At present the plaintiff's solicitor owes no duty of care to the defendant to ensure that information provided by the defendant is not given to third parties not involved with the case, either by negligence or design. A plaintiff's Solicitor can lose, misplace or send the information to anybody they want without the defendant having a recourse if he/she should suffer any loss. Remember that at the time of this action the defendant is \"innocent\" as the case is still ongoing and indeed may provide a sufficient defence that the Plaintiff's case fails. If this were to happen in a criminal case the defendant would have the protection of the law. That is all we want for defendants in civil cases.",
