        "background": "Nobody is the colour of coal ie no one is black. Nobody is the colour of snow, ie no one is white. These inaccurate labels polarise society and makes it appear we are more different than we actually are. They are a carry over from the days of slavery. \n\nThere are so many negative uses of the word black, that the moment it is used these other meanings come into ones attention span, and may introduce a negativity into ones thinking. As an example looking at the native American term for Europeans \u201cpale face\u201d, that can conjure up ideas of being unwell or sickly from the other uses of the word pale. \n\nThese labels make us divided and separate as a society and to stop using them would help society be more harmonious.\n\nAs using terms such as black and white attempt to differentiate varying levels of skin pigmentation, I also propose we use the terms lopig, mipig and hipig to describe people having low, medium and high pigmentation. These would be neutral with no intellectual baggage.",
