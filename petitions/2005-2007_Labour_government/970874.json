Law and order in our country must be upheld and criminals must be punished properly.\n\nI want to feel safe in the knowledge I can go to hospital when I'm ill and be seen to immediately and come out better than I went in.\n\nI want to feel safe knowing my child is getting a proper education and he is not being let down by his school or it's teachers or the poor standards set by their government.\n\nThese three things are the basic needs of any uk citizen and are a right to us all. We demand that this government gives it's people a country they are safe in, educated without prejudice and a health service we can be proud of.",
