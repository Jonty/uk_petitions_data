        "background": "Although we appreciate the need for older people to remain independant, some continue to drive when their ability to do so is often impaired.  At present all that is required is a doctors note to say that there is no medical reason that a license should be renewed.  This is putting other drivers at risk from at times eratic driving.  In Australia all renewals have to undertake a driving assessment to confirm suitablility to have the licence renewed.  This has cut accident levels signifcantly.",
