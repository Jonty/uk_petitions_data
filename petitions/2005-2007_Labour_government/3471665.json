Recent figures suggested there could be as many as several million untaxed vehicles on the road - possibly up to 10% of all traffic. As all these vehicles are using the roads illegally a concerted effort to remove them would free up a lot of space for those of us who play by the rules. Who knows it could even lead to sensible priced insurance premiums as we no longer have to pay for the uninsured as well.",
