            "background": "Currently NATS and the CAA can realign routes and stacks for aircraft without any form of public consultation. They are considering making changes to increase capacity at Luton and Stansted and allow for the implementation of Terminal 5 at Heathrow. These changes will have a devastating effect on large swathes of Cambridgeshire, Suffolk and Essex. Such changes should be subject to the same planning regime as is required  for building new airports.",
