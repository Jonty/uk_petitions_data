            "background": "Over the last 20 years schools have been used as a political playground. Constant change undermines the good work that could be done. A consistant framework will allow teachers skills to develop and children to understand what is expected of them. I propose education to be taken out of the party political system and managed by a bipartisan group of experts and parents rather than politicians with vested interest in the next election. Lets separate education from politics.",
