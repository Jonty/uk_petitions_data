            "background": "Since the unveiling of the official logo of the London Olympics and the associated news that this logo cost \u00a3400,000 there has been an overwhelmingly negative reaction to it. Comparisons have been drawn between it and the popular 80's TV show, Tiswas' logo. Other people have suggested that the logo looks akin to someone sneezing blancmange and custard on a piece of paper and writing London 2012 in it.\n\nEither way, this logo is in danger of causing humiliation to Britain in the lead up to the Olympics.\n\nI petition the Prime Minister to call for a redesign of this logo, maybe even to open the design to the public as some 'alternative' logos submitted to the BBC are of a truly different class.\nThis way we can have a logo which represents the spirit of the Olympics and one of which we can all be proud.",
