        "background": "Within the UK it seems that hard-working people are viewed as \"cash cows\" who can be milked to provide increasing revenues for the Government.  Indeed, there are many instances where hard-working people who have \"saved for a rainy day\" find this works against them if they become unemployed as they qualify for very little, if any, state support.\n\nWhile it is understandable that the Government needs to raise revenue it should also limit support available for those that have chosen (by their words or actions) to contribute little or nothing to the exchequer\n\nThere is a growing trend where hard-working people are deserting the UK and, if something isn't done about it soon, the hard-working people who are left will be expected to contribute even more.\n\nThe supporters of this petition believe that the current tax and benefits system is unfair to hard-working people and that the Government should reform it at the earliest opportunity.",
