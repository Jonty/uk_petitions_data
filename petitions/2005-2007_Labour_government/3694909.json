            "background": "I have just watched Several Hours of valuable debating time in Parliament, about Registering Mini Motos, being  wasted, that could have been used to debate Important Issues that currently get ignored through lack of time.\n\nMini Motos are a Diabolical Nuisance both in towns and in the countryside. They are also Dangerous in the hands of most of the yougsters who race them around our streets late at night. \nThey serve No Useful Purpose, and pump out Carbon Emissions and LOTS of Noise !\n\nSome MPs have argued for Local Authorities to provide \"Special Facilities\" where Mini Motos could be ridden, along with all kinds of other Controls and powers for police to enforce them ..... all of which will cost Tax-Payers a Small Fortune !!!\n\nI believe that the whole nation would be better off if the Manufacture, Importation, Sale and Use of Mini Motos were made Illegal, with Immediate Effect.",
