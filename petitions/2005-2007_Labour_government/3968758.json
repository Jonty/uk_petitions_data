        "action": "Consider the closure of the Stafford Day Service which caters for mentally and physically handicapped people.   The council have decided with very little consultation with the Parents/Carers to close this much needed facility.   The people who attend have varying degrees of handicap but are all mentally handicapped.   They need this \"special place\" where they can meet with, what is in effect an extended family, the Staff are dedicated and caring and enrich the lives of the Service Users.  Apparently there will be money available to \"buy in\" care/help - but there is excellent care available at present.   Can't think who said it but \"why mend it if it aint broken\".  The Service Users MUST be shown the same level of human rights as the rest of the population, otherwise it smacks of the dark days when they would have been hidden away.",
