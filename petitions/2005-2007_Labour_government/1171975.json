            "background": "The environmental damage being caused by industrialised nations is increasingly disproportionate to the small percentage of the global community that it economically benefits.  The USA is a major contributor and has refused to sign up to the Kyoto treaty.  This treaty signifies a meaningful desire to address the damage that is being done to the global environment that we all live in.  Our children and our children's children will suffer the consequences of our ignorance.  Please sign this petition in an attempt to make the voices of the normal person audible to the business interests of the current Presidency in the USA.",
