            "background": "It has been stated that the NHS is considering having only 1 general hospital to serve the whole of West Sussex.  This is ludicruos, especially when we have no hospital emergency or facilities to accommodate a possible crisis in the Gatwick (Crawley) area. Government requirements for the building of more homes in the area makes this suggestion even more crazy considering the population/commercial growth which would arise here.  Please stop the NHS from having to make this decision.",
