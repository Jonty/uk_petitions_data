Many were soldiers, who were either taken alive as undeclared prisoners of war or went missing in action in areas now under occupation.  Also missing are many civilians: men, women and children who were rounded up by the Turkish army from their own homes and villages but never released.\n \nTurkey ignores UN, EU and Council of Europe resolutions calling for an end to this humanitarian problem.  Refuses even to comply with the decision of the European Court of Human Rights (Appl. No; 25781/94-10 May 2001) and interim resolutions by the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe backing the Court\u2019s decision.",
