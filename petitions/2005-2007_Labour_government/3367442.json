            "background": "Since August, air transport has become very frustrating for travellers.British and European Union rules mean that tourists cannot bring back wine from their holiday without breaking it in the hold.Carry-on luggage is the only option because travellers have no confidence that their suitcase will arrive at their destination without being lost or damaged. So cosmetics and shampoo are confiscated by officious airport officials, who are discourteous to passengers, then yawn and do not look at the contents of the bags as they pass the X-Ray machines.To add insult to injury, just the other side of the security check, airport shops are ready to sell us back the Shampoo or lipstick they have confiscated at twice the price.The same is true in other European Airports, instead of buying a quality bottle of wine at the supermarket for 3 Euros, you have to buy a nasty bottle of wine in the airport priced at 30 Euros.The restrictions merely serve as an opportunity for profiteering by airport shops.",
