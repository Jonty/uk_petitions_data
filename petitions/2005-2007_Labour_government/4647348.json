This stands at 4.8%.\n\nThe Bank of England uses the Consumer Price Index to measure inflation. Currently 3.1%.\n\nThere is nothing stopping the RPI rising above the Bank of England base rate. So student debt could eventually become more expensive than other forms of debt.\n\nThe SLC should use the Consumer Price Index. Thus keeping student debt as \"cheap\" debt, as was originally intended.",
