            "background": "As there is only so much Oil in the ground and it will all be burnt sooner or later we may as well let the british motorist burn it rather than foreign countries benefitting their economies while we restrict our citizens and drive the cost of goods up (most products travel by road or rail) by trying to reduce our carbon emissions. Britain will fall behind the global economy if we continue to restrict carbon emissions. We should start to reverse this trend.",
