            "background": "Widening the M6 and building additional capacity on all motorways will just lead to more traffic and further demands for more motorway construction in the future.\n\nBetter solutions to traffic problems must be considered, such as home working, better railways and improving alternative routes.  For example, motorway status for the A38 and A14 to divert through traffic from the M6.  A wide range of solutions could help prevent Britain grinding to a halt (But not road use pay per mile, that would encourage road users to seek out \"rat runs\").  \n\nAs can be seen during school holidays, there only needs to be slight variations to work and busines traffic to achieve reasonable traffic flow.",
