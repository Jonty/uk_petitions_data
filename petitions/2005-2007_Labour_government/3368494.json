            "background": "Privatisation = giving the customer choice to increase competition and therefore reduce prices.\n\nPrivatisation does not do that for the railways. We cannot choose what company to take from London to Birmingham like we are able to choose our gas supplier. Therefore, we have no choice but to travel with the private company serving our route and thus we have no choice - there is no other alternative. \n\nNationalising the railways to form British Rail will mean politicians are accountable for the service provided by the railway. No longer will there be the faceless chief executive who isn't there to take the wrap for poor performance. A public-owned railway would also mean profit would be invested back into the railway unlike the current situation where part of the money made goes to greedy shareholders.\n\nSign for a public-owned railway and sign for bringing back some common sense to the railways!",
