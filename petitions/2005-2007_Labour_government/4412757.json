            "background": "The overall tax burden has risen exponentially since this labour government has come to power.\n\nI would suggest that most reasonable people would accept that additional money is required to improve services and would generally be content to pay this additional tax for better services.\n\nHowever, whilst most people would accept that there has been some improvement in some areas of public services, these improvements have not been sufficient to justify the huge amount of extra money that has been generated.\n\nTherefore, the government should be, in future, considerably wiser about how and where this additional public money is spent so that real and substantial improvements for the tax payer are delivered.",
