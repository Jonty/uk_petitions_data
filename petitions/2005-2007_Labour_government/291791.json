        "background": "Every year 17 year olds pass their test and immediatley jump into very powerful cars and more often or not have an accident that results in death or serious injury.\nI would like a new law that prevents new drivers from driving such vehicles and be limited to 1.2 litres with required test passes for higher cc cars with a minimum time limit of 3 years before such test is allowed.\nThis will reduce the number of boy racers and will reduce the number of deaths on our roads.",
