            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "To away from the Mon to Fri 9\u20135 work day (bank hours), and into line with the private sector week.\n\nA office worker losses 4 mins of work time when distracted by a phone call. How much time is lost when the same worker has to take an hour or more off to see a member of the civil service because of there working hours.\n\nTo help the UK\u2019s industry in reducing lost working time, change the civil service\u2019s working week to include Sat mornings and a morning and afternoon shift system, 7am \u2013 3pm and 3pm \u2013 11pm. \n\nThe shift system and the Sat morning shift, will allow normal workers in the private sector to visit a civil service worker with out losing time from work. This will also allow workers who do not have fixed working week hours, like truck drivers who start at 5am and finish at 8pm, to sort out issues like tax ect, with out having to make plans around there work commitments.\n\nThe shift system would also increases the amount of work being done by the civil service.\n\nThe morning and afternoon shift system will also help with road congestion as it will move people who work in the civil service from being on the road just before 9am and just after 5pm, to earlier and later in the day.",
