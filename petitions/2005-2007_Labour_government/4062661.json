            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Currently, if someone receives repeated phone calls in a way designed to harass, for example, one phone call a minute for a period of time and if the number is withheld then when the victim contacts their telephone provider, the phone provider is unable to pass the number of the person harassing on to the victim due to the data protection act.\n\nOfcom will not deal with this issue and will refer the victim back to either their phone provider, where they will be met with the above issue, or the police. \n\nThe police are equally powerless, in that they cannot request the phone number from the victims phone provider without a warrant to bypass the data protection act, however as a silent anonymous phone call cannot be separated from a mis-dialling company fax machine for example there is no grounds for a warrant to be issued.\n\nIf the victim is forced to change their telephone number, the amount of hassle that is caused the victim in doing so amounts to the victim suffering regardless and the person doing the harassment succeeding in their goal whilst protected by the data protection act all the way.",
