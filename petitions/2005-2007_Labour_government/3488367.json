This being a potentially serious issue, needs to be sorted urgently but I am unable to book an appointment. I would like the prime minister to respond directly to me in the first instance and additionally, the rest of the citizens of England on this issue and explain the exact reasons why this incredulous situation is allowed to continue. Has he lost the ability and direction as an elected person to carry out the will of those that elected him. I'm glad that I am at least not responsible for his or his party's election and never will be.\nPlease do your job or give the reigns to someone with the will to change this.",
