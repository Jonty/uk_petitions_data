            "background": "Tony Blair has had ten years as Prime Minister to introduce any improvements to society that he is capable of implementing. Sadly, he has absolutely nothing positive to show for his time in office.\n\nEducation standards are plummeting (which is why no Labour politician wants their children in a state school), virtually all public services are at disgraceful performance levels despite billions of pounds spent on them and prisons have no more room for criminals.\n\nWe are paying far more taxes for much worse public services. Transport, health services, policing, security in general, personal freedom, education, housing costs, utilities and even the BBC are worse under Blair. Can anyone honestly say their quality of life is better thanks to Tony Blair's policies?\nThe UNICEF report that shows Britain\u2019s children have the worst quality of life is the final straw. It\u2019s time for Blair to make way for someone who does more than just talk and make empty promises.",
