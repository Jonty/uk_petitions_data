            "background": "We all too often see the use of children in government campaigns, from anti-speeding to environmental issues. Why burdon children with worries in this way? We create anxiety for our young people at a time when they should be enjoying life. Worries can come later! We should not use children as pawns in this way. Campaign for what you believe in by all means, but do not coerce youngsters into agreeing to take part when they are too young to make rational decisions for themselves.",
