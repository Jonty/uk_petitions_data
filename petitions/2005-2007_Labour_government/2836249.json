I enjoy cultural diversity in our community. Like musicians, pedlars bring something different & entertaining to the streets. \nThe Bills are unfair. \nPlease Prime Minister forget about harming this pedlar by back door legislation and concentrate on keeping our street culture dynamic and alive. \nI endorse this pedlar's activities.",
