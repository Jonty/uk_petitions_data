To mark this auspicious occasion, we ask Tony Blair as one of his final acts as Prime Minister to make the 28th May National 'Kylie' Day, so this great nation can celebrate her birthday every year. It is further requested that he announce this at the Kylie Birthday Party in aid of Cancer Research taking place at the Gardening Club, Covent Garden from 6pm to 11pm on May 28th. Unfortunately he will be required to pay the \u00a35 entry fee as all proceeds go to charity.",
