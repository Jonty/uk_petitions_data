        "background": "Millions of people across the country are connected to dsl broadband (which comes through the BT line) but hundreds of thousands of these are not getting full speeds because of\n\n1) Copper quality is too poor due to it being very old\n\n2) Wire length (from exchange to house) is too long\n\nWhat we want is to make BT do a test on copper quality (in your house) if it is not of such high quality to recieve at 'least' 40% of the \"UP TO\" speed. Then they (BT) should be required to re-wire to try and increase speed and quality, even if they are not the ISP, as long as they provide the line and the customer pays line rental\n\nIn a ever advancing world how can we not have fast and good quality broadband?",
