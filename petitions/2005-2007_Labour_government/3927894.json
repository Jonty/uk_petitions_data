            "background": "The EU is about to draw up new industrial policies which will mean that the traditional lightbulb will be phased out of shops by 2009.\n\nThe removal of the traditional lightbulb is an infringement on British traditions of the past 100 years and also is likely to cause increased levels of blindness as people strain their eyes with the weaker light.\n\nSign this petition and put a stop to the EUs increasingly authoritarian manner to its citizens",
