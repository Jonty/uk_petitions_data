            "background": "At present the residents of Islay and Jura only have their household waste uplifted fortnightly. This change was forced upon us in August 2006 whilst the remainder of Argyll & Bute Council area carried on with weekly collections. The time has come for council officials and employees to realise that they are employed to provide a service to all council tax payers irrespective of where they live. Coucil officials and employees should remember that their wages and pension payments are paid for by council tax payers and without them they would be jobless",
