            "background": "On 19/06/2007, A Statement was released from the BBFC denying an official rating  for the Videogame \"Manhunt 2\" Which was due to be released on 13/07/2007 For The Nintendo Wii & Sony Playstation 2 Consoles. This forces the game to be unavailable in the United Kingdom. \n\nThousands of people are feeling very much let down by this. Buisnesses will lose huges ammounts of income due to the loss of sales.\n\nTherefore, We urge that the BBFC take another look and consider the people it serves. Understandably the game will Carry an 18 rating, and that would be perfectly acceptable.",
