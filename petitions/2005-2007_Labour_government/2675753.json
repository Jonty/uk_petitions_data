As a member of the two wheeled community also, this is getting more and more serious with every year. Bad roads kill people. Even the best drivers, no matter how skilled can be caught out by bad road design and poor road surfaces. As a motorcyclist this is even more severe  - a poor road surface is lethal to a two wheel user, there are many reports available corroborating this.\nWe petition the Prime Minister to stop siphoning off funds from the collection of road tax and use the FULL amount for what it is intended, fix our roads, and help keep us alive.",
