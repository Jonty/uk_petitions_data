Using our current resourses our forces would be unable to leave thier postings to return home, or go off to and protect ground troops anywhere else in the world, are country is built on proud and powerful naval traditions however the new plans will leave us looking weak to any opposing country and open to any threats to are home security.  I urge you all to sign up and allow our boys (and girls too) to continue to protect us.",
