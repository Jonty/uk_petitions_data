            "background": "Britain needs a natinal day, and what better day to pick than VE day which could be renamed British independance day or British national day. I think this day is perfect as it was the day independance was recognised with the victory of WW2. It united our Island and was one of the biggest parts of our history.\n\nI think this should be our national holiday for Great Britain and it would even have themes as on this day, in LOndon alone, over a million people celebrated in a carnival. So the day would be a day off for familys and we could have carnivals all over the country.",
