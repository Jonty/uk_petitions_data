        "background": "Hospitals used to be able to put morbidly obese patients on a restricted calorie diet- in order to allow them to benefit from significant weight loss during their hospital stay (in which time the patients calorific needs are reduced anyway- since they are confined to a hospital bed).\n\nThey are now required to provide all patients with food of the same calorie content. \n\nRe-legislation on this issue would allow hospitals to help morbidly obese patients to regain their mobility, reduce their dependency and improve their overall health.",
