However, when referendums and debates are taking place, there is hardly ever a representative of humanist views for example, meaning that many people's values are not being appreciated, in favour of religious ones. I only ask that Atheist ethics are given fair and preportional representation in the consideration of legislation.\n\nWe also ask that legeslation protecting religious views from attack, are equally applied to atheism and that remarks such as \"Atheists are immoral\" are treated in the same way as if 'Atheists' was replaced with 'Jews', 'Muslims' or 'Christians'.",
