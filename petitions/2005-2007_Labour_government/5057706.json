            "background": "Part of childhood and growing up is experiencing and exploring the world around us. This involves taking a few risks and probably receiving a few bruises, but so what? They are important and fun experiences that we learn from. In fact, a boy who receives an impressive bruise or even gets a plaster cast will show it off to all his mates as an achievement! But it seems like every year more restrictions are put in place until we get to today's Britain, where children cannot do anything remotely adventurous without masses of forms and lawsuits, even to the point of teachers and scout leaders refusing to organise trips.",
