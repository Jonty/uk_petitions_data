This is an unacceptable situation and one in which the future lawyers and members of the United Kingdom's judiciary are starting their professional life deep in debt with when adding accomodation and living costs total soaring to \u00a318,000 all for their one year of study at the LPC Providers.\n\nWe LPC Students feel that we should be granted all our tuition fees for free by the British Government as our future of law is jepardised by the current farce that restricts so many students who have graduated with Law degrees from completing their legal training",
