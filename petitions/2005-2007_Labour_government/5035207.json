The student population will be divided into 4  houses:\nBilleslet\nGreville\nOversley\nRagley\nThe second big change will be with the tutor groups. Each house will have 10 tutor groups making the groups smaller. In each group will be approximately 5 people from each year group. Making a group of 25 people in each tutor group.\nStudents are being seperated from life long friends and being imprisoned with people who they do not get on with.\nEvery single pupil at the school opposes the idea. Please show your support to the 850 students who from September 2007 will have to suffer.",
