            "background": "Rewarding those who work is important so the working tax credits are good in that respect. However, I work very hard and my wife stays at home to look after our son. We struggle to make ends meet. If a childminder had our son or we got divorced we would get extra money. Surely being cared for by your own parent is of at least equal value to childcare, (provided standards are met). There are families all around us who do not work and can afford to go to the pub, smoke, have Sky and a fancy car.  While, because we want our family to fit a traditional structure we struggle to do any of this. \n\nPlease support the family and stop forcing those who are providing adequate standards of care to their own children to leave their children with strangers. Stop rewarding lazy scrubbers and pretend cripples and help those of us who still have a little respect for society. Thanks. \n\nI do not want having 20 children to be a way of dodging work. I just think good parenting should be rewarded.",
