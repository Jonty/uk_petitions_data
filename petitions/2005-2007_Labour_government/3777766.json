            "background": "Carbon cards will be like mobile phone top-up cards. Every person will be given for example 1000 carbon points to start the year. As you fill up your car with petrol a certain number of points will be deducted, points will also be deducted if you take a flight according to the distance of the flight. Basically any environmentally polluting activity will cost carbon points. If you require more points you can buy them (environmental tax for those who pollute the most) or you can recycle to gain points. (Of course this is to be used as well as money). Also carbon cards could be combined with the ID cards the government wants to bring in.",
