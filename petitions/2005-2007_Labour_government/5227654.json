            "background": "The 2012 Olympic logo was revealed yesterday (5th June, 2006) as a \"vibrant\" and \"innovative\" icon for the 2012 games. With a \u00a3400k price-tag, is this not a little too much for something that is so easily created on microsoft word (http://www.b3ta.com/board/7253579)? \nThe budget is already more than initially projected, isn't it wise that we should be cutting corners? It is for this reason I propose a national competition where people of all ages and creeds design the logo, with the final top 10 being put to the public vote. Let's at least give someone an opportunity of a lifetime and help fund the games in the process.\n\nSo I ask you. Does the logo show an English pride? No. \nDoes it show off our wonderfully vibrant culture and society? No. \nMost importantly of all, do \"we\" as a nation like it?\n\nIf you feel the same way, please sign this petition to rethink the 2012 logo.",
