It is time to put an end to this.  Religious beliefs are no grounds to engage in such abhorrent behaviour, and we call for ANY group which promotes or supports such discrimination to be outlawed, and for legislation that ensures that religious beliefs cannot be used as a defence for such behaviour.",
