The wheels can mount the bonnet, and the front bumper/grille can enter the passenger compartment.\n\n4x4 /SUV drivers will be safe and sound in most instances, but the other vehicle's occupants are placed in terrible and avoidable danger. \n\nIts similar to being hit by a standard car, while you're driving a go-kart.",
