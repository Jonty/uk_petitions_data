        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "When abusive ex partners decide to launch malicious applications for child contact, resident parents should be entitled to legal aid, particularly after a Finding of Fact, where abuse has been found. Frequently provable malicious applications by absent parents (particularly where the absent parent fails to maintain contact awarded or frequently takes resident parent to court for changes in contact agreements) are forcing resident parents and children into poverty so that they can provide representation to protect themselves and their children from abusers. Legal aid should be provided on behalf of the minor in every instance. Children deserve their Human Rights to be protected where they risk being placed in contract with an abuser in every instance, regardless of whether that abuser is genetically related to them or not.",
