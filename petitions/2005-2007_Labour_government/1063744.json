Every child should be given the chance to experience a wide range of flavours at an early age and become familiar with a diversity of produce. They should learn about healthy eating and balance. They should be shown the basics of food preparation and be inspired to try for themselves.\n\nGood food is central to health and happiness, so inspiration and education should start as young as possible.",
