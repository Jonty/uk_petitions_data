            "background": "Did you know that any movable piece of our heritage can be sent to America and that much of it is being shipped abroad.  Anything worth less than \u00a332,000 can be sent to America and anything worth less than \u00a365,000 can be sent to Europe.  The trade is a lucrative one because once in America these items are sold for cash without going to auction there atall and the cash without tax or tariff deducted comes back to the shippers who then buy for cash at auctions in the UK and ship abroad again.\n\nIt strikes me we are losing our national heritage for the sake of short term gain.  The shippers are pushing up prices at auctions so that local buyers cannot purchase furniture for example and as prices are high many households are selling furniture to pay bill and debts.\n\nThis is all bad new for work.  Work is lost permanently by exporting.  Work of restoring and renovating, work of reselling and moving.  Work for generations to come is being lost year for year and it is time to put a stop to the whole sale export of our national heritage.  Shops buying and selling furniture locally have all but disappeared.",
