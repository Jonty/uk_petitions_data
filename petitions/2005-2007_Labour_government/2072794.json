Employers who are found guilty of bulling in the workplace at an empolyment tribunial do not have to pay any compensation except out of pocket losses due to bulling and harrassment not being included as discrimination. Therefore no compensation is awarded for the anguish, distress, and stress of being targeted and forced out of your employment. An employer can treat an employee as they wish as long as its not based on skin colour, culture, sex, sexual orination or disability. If your manager desides they dont like your face bacuse of there own private prejudices, they can intimidate you, scrunatise you, make threats about your job, belittle you infront of people that you work with and teams that you lead. The can make you life as uncomfortable as they want because if you go to an employment tribunial you will not be awarded compenastion as it is not classed as discrimination.",
