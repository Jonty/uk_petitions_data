Our soldiers who were taken by Iran on the 24th of March 2007 are being illegally held hostage, the evidence you have backed tells us that they were in Iraqi waters at the time of their illegal arrest and detainment.\n\nWhy are we seeing a Royal Navy marine paraded on TV without her combat fatigue's? They are making fools of the UK in front of the world. We want our soldiers back. No strongly worded memos passed between embassies. We want our soldiers back by force if necessary, no more words.",
