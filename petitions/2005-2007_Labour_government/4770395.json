I refer to local councils and the decisions that seem to be made in our absence; decisions such as building applications and other item that you are allowed to have a say on but because it is buried in the town hall rarely notice until they have been implemented. I propose that the government look into on my behalf the best way to make anything that can be which is handled by local government, online, accessible and \u2018votable\u2019 on by the general public. We should be able to vote online and make objections known online at the technological  stage which we are at and that\u2019s what this petition is about, anyone agree? Thanks for reading.",
