We have them at Christmas and New Year (3 in a week), 2 at Easter, one early May and one late May, then one at end of summer in late August. Why not have national holidays that will help our tourist industry? ie in the summer, when people can enjoy them, in the UK. We do not have one in our potentially best weather period from end of May to end of August. Mid summer bank holidays would be great. Christmas and New Year just drags and Easter is invariably not UK beach weather!",
