            "background": "Girls who are under 16 should not be allowed to get an abortion without parents consent.  No girl is in a reasonable state of mind when she finds out she is pregnant to make a decision about having an abortion without her mother knowing about her being pregnant.  The long terms affects of abortion are not explained properly.  No girl should be allowed to make a decision like this on her own.  There are enough girls out there living in secret/shame because they dare not tell their parents what they have done.  When are people going to wake up and realise that abortion is murder and a life is involved when someone becomes pregnant.  This has to stop.  It also undermines parents authority.",
