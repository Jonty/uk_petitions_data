            "background": "Our Government, and hence us, have spent huge amounts of money having a comprehensive system of motorways built throughout the country. Whenever a 3-lane motorway is reduced to only 2 lanes, the congestion caused is immense. There is a considerable minority of drivers who think it is their God-given right to sit in the middle lane, causing untold congestion and frustration. If the govenrnment had intended us to use just 2 lanes, then that is how the roads would have been constructed. Surely it must be a cost-effective exercise for motorway police (and surveillance cameras) to spot those drivers who drive so selfishly, and issue suitable punishments. An advertising campaign on televison and in the press would help to educate these drivers. Those drivers who do not have the reactive skills to move in and out of the left-hand two lanes should not really be using these relatively high speed roads.",
