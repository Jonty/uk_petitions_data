        "background": "Rail fare prices have spiraled out of control and it is forcing the environmentally conscious public into their cars to exacerbate global warming and unprecedented congestion levels\n\nFor example: \n1 Adult single journey from Hull to Aldershot (1 day notice)\nStandard single: \u00a392\nOne-way hire car and fuel: \u00a389 (\u00a369 Car + \u00a320 fuel)\nDriving own car: \u00a320 for fuel\n\n2 Adults + 1 Child Return journey Leatherhead to Manchester (1 day notice)\nStandard return: \u00a3607.50\nHire car and fuel from: \u00a375 (\u00a350 Car + \u00a325 fuel)\nDriving own car: \u00a325 for fuel\n\nIn order to get people out of their cars and into trains the current fares must be reduced sufficiently less than the costs of driving our cars. I urge the Prime Minister to remove his focus from road pricing and tolls and to take action against the embarrassingly extortionate fares that are pricing willing public transport travelers off the trains.",
