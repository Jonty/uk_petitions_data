Its about time the governments stopped using it as an excuse to extort money from law abiding motorists, to line their own pockets.\nStop telling lies, stop the propganda campaign against motorists. Enough is enough.\n\nIf you want to reduce CO2 emissions that strongly, and save the planet.....stop breathing. That WILL have a massive effect on CO2 emissions, both directly, and in-directly.",
