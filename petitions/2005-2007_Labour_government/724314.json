Our spirits need to be lifted at this time by an Autumn holiday and the end of October would be ideal as there is a good chance of fine weather and there is still warmth in the sun, and, furthermore it is shortly before the clocks go back,\n\nAs a nation we should take more pride in our glorious history and remember that we were then saved from invasion by the strength of the Royal Navy and our command of the seas around Europe.   The Government should take note of the many public re-enactments of the battle around our coasts and the huge surge of interest during the 200th anniverary. \nWe should keep alive this national pride by celebrating the anniversary annually.",
