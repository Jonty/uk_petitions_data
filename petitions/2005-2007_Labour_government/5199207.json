Not the symbol of the world's biggest sporting event being held in one of the world's great cities.\n\nC'mon - we can do better than that.\n\nIf the government is paying for the games, can we not spend money on an open competition for the public - to aid \"participation, stimulation, access, and inspiration\", the alleged \"brand pillars\" of the games.\n\nThen a vote on the winner from a shortlist.\n\nIs that so much to ask?\n\nFor the public to have a say in the key symbol of an event that will be publicly funded, representing London and the UK to the rest of the world, and that we will be stuck with for the next five years at least?",
