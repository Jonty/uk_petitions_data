            "background": "Our local (town) council are trying to build on a designated flood plain which floods currently every 1-3 years. It has been suggested that they may build anyway regardless of any risk or objection from the Environment Agency (EA), as they do not have to adhere to EA recommendations. The EA are best placed to understand affects of flooding or any other damaging factors on our environment (such as the destruction of local open areas originally set aside to residents). The EA must be given these powers to help stop this. For me the year 2007 is the year of global warming and we must now act. The BBC have recently run a science programme to highlight how we should stop now building on these flood plains. Please support this appeal.",
