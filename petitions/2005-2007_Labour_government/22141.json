Why not pay patients for treatment given by a private dentist, at the rate it would be if they had been treated at an NHS dentist. It is appreciated that the scale of charges are different and the materials used may be different but that could be taken into account. Give patients the choice to pay the difference if they go to a private dentist. Surely that would help clear the backlog and could be put in place very easily. After all, most people don't like changing their dentist so if they can afford to pay the difference they surely would",
