            "background": "Insisting weddings take place in a building is directly contrary to some peoples religious beliefs (eg: many druids feel that all important ceremonies should be held fully in sight of the sun) and some people just prefer it and feel it's a more honest place, therefore, on the grounds of religious equality, to avoid unecessary discrimination, and for freedom of choice, we ask that the government\nforthwith change the law to allow registrars to solemnise marriages which take place outdoors (in approved venues) as well as indoors and that they no longer require a separate legal ceremony which belittles the significance of the outdoor spiritual event.",
