        "background": "In 2004-2005 the difference between Scotland's revenues and it's spending was \u00a311.3billion, while in Wales this deficit was \u00a38.9billion.  \n\nEssentially, \u00a320billion is paid per year by English tax payers to prop up Scotland and Wales' public sectors.  \n\nGiven the well known animosity to English people expressed by many Scots and Welsh people, it is galling at best that England is forced to subsidise them. \n\nGiven that the Scottish parliament now has tax raising powers of its own, it would seem only right that England, Wales and Scotland should have seperate treasuries and separate budgets.",
