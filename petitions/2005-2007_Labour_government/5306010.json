        "background": "The government has tightened control on bogus language schools who provide attendance certificates for cash. However, many \u2018agents\u2019 in the UK who recruit students for UK universities or assist with visa applications do so by providing fake documents such as academic transcripts, attendance, IELTS scores, graduation certificates, dissertations etc. They advertise openly in the UK-based non-English press and provide a wider range of illegal services than bogus language schools. If the government is serious about border control and immigration then we recommend establishing at least a Register of UK Agents (similar to the DfES Register of Providers) or even an accreditation scheme that would allow both universities and students to discern the legitimate agencies from the law-breaking agencies allowed to freely operate in the UK.",
