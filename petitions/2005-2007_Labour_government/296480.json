The sufferer progressively loses the power of virtually everything until they are left wholly powerless while at the same time their mind and spirit remain wholly unaffected. In its final stages it is no exaggeration to say that it becomes like a 'living death' akin to finding yourself buried alive.\n\nBy way of contrast the condition strangely sometimes brings 'out the best in people' - I have heard Dicken's phrase 'it was the worst of times; it was the best of times' used without any sense of contradiction.\n\nI strongly urge you and your ministers to look favourably on the Petition.\n\nI take the opportunity of thanking you for all you do for our country; thank you.\n\nDavid McNaughton",
