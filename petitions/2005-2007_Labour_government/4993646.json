        "action": "Scrap the Eu's CAP (Common Agricultural Policy)",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The original intentions of the CAP were to (set out in article 39, Treaty of Rome): increase productivity, ensure a fair standard of living for the agriculural community, stabilise markets, secure availability of supllies and provide consumers with reasonable prices. Instead it condemns 3rd world farmers to poverty, means EU consumers pay higher food prices, subsidises inefficient farms, promotes overproduction thus damaging the environment, prevents the free market allocating goods efficiently, and wastes much of the EU budget which could be spent on more important areas such as education, training, scientific research and economic development.",
