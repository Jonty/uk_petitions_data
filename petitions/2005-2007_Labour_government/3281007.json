            "background": "People can find out about gambling through more obvious means and advertising is not neccessary to support it and draw the most vulnerable members of society into it, i.e. the poor and the young. I grant that gambling is as harmful, if not exceedingly more harmful than cigarette smoking; and so its subsequent associated advertising should be made illegal. Gamblers with problems do not need any further encouragement. In addition this will prevent excerbating problems with new large and super-casinos.",
