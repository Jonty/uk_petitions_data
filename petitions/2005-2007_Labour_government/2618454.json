            "background": "With the cost of living going up all the time and various stealth taxes imposed upon us by the goverment, the minimum wage is not enough to live on. As a single person, having to pay the bills, rent and run the car is a constant struggle. The goverment claim that they have made work pay, but this is simply not the case. Is it any wonder that so many people rely on benefits to live. If you work full time, but for low wages, you are just as well off on part time hours and then you can claim a certain ammount of housing benefit and council tax benefit. This isn't right. The goverment would save a fortune in adminastration if they made work REALLY pay and then they could scrap benefits as people would not need to claim them as they would be earning enough. Tony Blair, make work REALLY PAY!",
