            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Huge floating concrete structures built, perhaps, in the redundant docks previously used for the construction of North Sea oil rigs, and providing jobs to the redundant expertise on the banks of the Clyde, could be built ashore, floated out to sea and linked together. Being so massive, these floating factory platforms would support wind turbines, PV arrays, wave and tidal energy generation machines and float as anchored, stable giants, avoiding the difficult to solve problems of being built on the bottom of the sea, and maintained from ships, as off shore wind farms now are. Situated at sea some of the electricity generated could be used onboard to produce hydrogen, from sea water, to be piped ashore for cooking, water heating, space heating, electricity generation, welding and cutting, the synthesis and purification of other chemical materials, and fuel for automobiles and aeroplanes. All the technology is current, tried and tested.",
