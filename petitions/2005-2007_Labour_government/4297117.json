            "background": "I believe Snoop Dogg should be granted a temporary visa to visit the United Kingdom to perform his planned series on concerts. Thousands of fans of hip-hop music have already paid upwards of \u00a330 per ticket to see this living legend and the government have seen fit to deny him access to the country for no good reason. Although i am in favour of us being more scrupulous of who we allow to enter our great country i truly believe this man poses no threat to our safety. He is here to entertain through music and culture that is all.",
