They want to turn the former Maze prison into a Sports stadium and some kind of terrorism shrine/conflict resolution centre.\nI am all for redevelopment and investment, but not under any ill thought out political agenda. \nThe idea of turning a notorious symbol of our troubled past into a symbol of the future of Northern Ireland is probably a very appealing idea to those at Westminster, but the idea is based solely on Politics and not the hard economic facts.\nThe vast majority of Sporting fans who this stadium is supposedly going to cater for (Football, Rugby and Gaelic Football) do not want a stadium \"out in the sticks\"; they want it based in the city centre of Belfast. \nThe bill for this \"white elephant\" will of course be footed by the tax payer. I suggest they listen to the tax payer and deliver us a Stadium that we want, without the politics of our past.",
