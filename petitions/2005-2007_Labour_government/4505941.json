            "background": "This petition is in support of Mr Abdulhakim Gellani a British citizen from London and Mr Abdullah Hassan a Libyan citizen living in Ireland. Both brothers were detained in Saudi Arabia without any charges against them, and were later released but prevented from leaving the country without any good reasons. Mr Gellani and Mr Hassan travelled to Saudi Arabia as Hajj Operators and entered the country legally. \n\n \n\nMr Hassan, who is partially disabled, was admitted to hospital 2 weeks ago and his health is deteriorating as a result of the poor living conditions in Makkah where he and his friend Mr Gellani have no support from the Saudi Authority or anyone else.\n\n \n\nWe urge you all to support both, Mr Gellani and Mr Hassan by calling on the Saudi Authority to allow them to come home to heir families and children.",
