Amazingly British officials in Nepal told the man who put his life on the line for King and country \"You have failed to demonstrate that you have strong ties with the UK.\" Explaining his reasons for the application, he said: \"I take a substantial amount of medication daily, without which I would die. There is not always a constant supply. When it runs out I feel vulnerable. It involves a day's walk - and as he is unable to walk that far, he has to be carried in a basket by several men.  On 23 June 1944 almost all his comrades were wiped out by heavy enemy fire. He seized a Bren Gun & firing from the hip while running through ankle deep mud, he ignored Japanese fire to single handedly storm enemy machine gun positions. His official citation read: \"His outstanding courage and superb gallantry in the face of odds which meant almost certain death were most inspiring to all ranks and beyond praise.\"",
