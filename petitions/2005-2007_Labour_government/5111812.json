        "background": "By extending the A428 dual carriageway from the Caxton Gibet, A1198, to the A1 south and west of Huntingdon and call it the A14, traffic using the existing A14 from Cambridge to Huntingdon would be reduced.  The A14 traffic could continue on at Junction 31 and the traffic using the M11 could continue onto the existing A14.  Thus the traffic would not merge at Barr Hill causing the problems of congestion and accidents.  It was also have a good knock on effect at Huntingdon.",
