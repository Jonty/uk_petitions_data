        "background": "Make it compulsory that all owners of temporary allotment sites make them statutory sites.  All new sites to automaticly be registered as statutory sites.\nTemporary allotment sites may have been in use for over 60 years, but it is very easy for the owner to take back the site and use it for something else. i.e. building land.\nStatutory sites wanted for other uses must have ministerial permission before they can be taken back. Security of tenure means a plotholder could make long term plans. Such as planting fruit trees, making raised beds & spending money for long term benefit.",
