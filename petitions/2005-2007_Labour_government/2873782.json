This amounts to selling off the country lock stock to another country which should never happen.\n\nFor example P&O was bought by a government in the middle east, London electricity is owned by EDF which is controlled by the French state.\n\nWhat I would love this country to do is to say that no British company is eligible to be owned or bought into by any foreign company/fund which is controlled or owned by a foreign nation.",
