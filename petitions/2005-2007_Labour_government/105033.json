        "background": "It seems obvious to me, with my limited knowledge of physics, that the answer to the worlds energy and environmental problems is the sun. It is already, in the words of monty python, the source of all our power. It seems ridiculous to attempt to create another sun (the International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor) when we already have one. Concentrated Solar power would seem to be the obvious, safe, efficent, solution to this problem and i urge you to look at it more seriously.",
