I have come up with a solution that will deal with all these.\n\nWe must be given mechs.\n\nImagine, if you will! Men, women and children, traversing the country in robotic walking battle tanks! See a terrorist? No more running and hiding; blast them apart with plasma dischargers! Neighbour growing their hedge to tall? Use your on-board flamethrower to deal with it yourself, and then duel it out... no court action needed here! Cars jamming the roads? Use your built-in ramjets to leap over traffic, buildings and obstacles to carry on your way!\n\nI think we all know that this would propel Britain to a brighter, fuller, far more INTERESTING future.",
