            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The govenrment should allow transfer of tax allowances between married partners. Everyone has a single persons tax allowance, the amount they are allowed to earn before they pay tax. At present if one married partner works and the other does not, the unworking partners tax allowance is wasted. Usually there is a reason for one partner not working, such as child rearing. If the working partner were allowed to use the unworking partners tax allowance, it would go some way to supporting those who choose the traditional married family setup - i.e. 1 breadwinner and 1 carer. This could be the difference between being able to afford to be at home with the children and having to work to pay bills and therefore using child care.",
