        "background": "EERA is a unelected, undemocratic quango pretending to be the \u201cregional government\u201d of the geographically absurd \u201cEast of England Region\u201d. This comprises East Anglia (Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire and Essex) plus two adjacent Home Counties (Hertfordshire and Bedfordshire). It makes no sense from any historical or current perspective and has no resonance with the people who live there. \n\nThe Government promised a referendum on these \u201cEnglish Regional\u201d assemblies until voters rejected the \u201cNorth East\u201d assembly. But the EERA has continued to work without such a mandate.\n\nThe EERA's Plans to build over 500,000 new houses and expand Luton and Stansted Airports would destroy much of the countryside and Green Belt. They appear to have no regard for new infrastructure needed (transport, hospitals and schools), the environmental damage or the views of existing residents. \n\nEERA should be abolished immediately.",
