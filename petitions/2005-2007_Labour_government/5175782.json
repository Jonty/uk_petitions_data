        "background": "Our current enthusiasm for recycling overlooks the fact that plastic bags shouldn't be handed out in the first place. In many French supermarkets they are not. Guess what. People take their own bags. Those who don't can buy them. Because the shop sells them. That's what shops do. The current mantra about recycling misses the point. Unfortunately it looks extremely unlikely that any major supermarket chain will voluntarily withdraw free plastic bags. Someone who bought one of the trendy \"I'm not a plastic bag\" bags in a supermarket reported that it was carefully placed in a plastic carrier bag before being handed over. Absurd.",
