I am also opposed to the idea of having to collect one's post rather than having it delivered; how would one know until one had got to one's local (or not so local since so many have closed) post office, and stood in a queue for however long it would take, whether or not one actually had any post?  And if any letter needed an urgent phone call to sort the specific issue out this might have to wait till the following day, or possibly even the following Monday, if one was unable to get home to make the call that day (one might not want to use one's mobile re not wanting everyone within earshot to know one's private business).",
