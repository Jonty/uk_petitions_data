        "background": "The reduced speed limit on this strectch of road from 70 mph to 40 and 50 mph is farcical. There are no pedestrians anywhere near this by-pass and the new speed limit is causing drivers to drive through Kimberly instead of taking the by-pass, therefore increasing the risk to all road users.\nI believe that the limit should be raised back to the national speed limit.",
