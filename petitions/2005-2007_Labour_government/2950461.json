It would be better for the country if MP's were limited to the national average, as this would make them more liable to get the national average pay increased. Cbinet ministers should get 1.5 times the national average and the PM should get no more than twice the national average. There was a time when being an MP was a matter of duty and national service, not to line there own pockets",
