            "background": "The mental Health Services have been denuded of funds in favour of more \"glamorous\" parts of the N.H.S. People with severe and enduring mental illness and their carers, including those with schizophrenia have been short changed. The media have been quick to report cases of schizophrenia who have not received the treatment they require, and have fallen into the florid state of mental illness, which at times has caused them to commit crimes, even homicide. The carers have a great burden to carry, and even when such above happenings occur often receive blame, when their sick relative has been unable to access the services they require. At times they do not recognise the need, and relatives are not taken notice of, even though they are the people with day to day contact with the patient. Many with mental illness get lost to the Mental health Services, and become missing persons. It is not for the police to have to take these people to prison, but they may take them to a suitable psychiatric centre. Often there are too few, and no beds which are required for assessment and establishment of treatment.",
