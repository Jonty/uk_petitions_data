        "background": "The police/motorist relationship is under constant pressure because the police are only associated with negative issues. There is no mechanism for rewarding good driving. By allowing police officers to issue 'bonus' points for good driving, (a) the balance would be restored and (b) motorists would view the police more positively. They would also (c) benefit from evidence that could be taken into consideration in the event of any subsequent motoring offence.",
