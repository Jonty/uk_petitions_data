Combinations elected/appointed are sham tinkering from sleight-of-handers. Let it be a house for EVERY clear thinking Briton to attend at will IF he/she can show qualification. The only way we can show such qualification is IQ measurement + experience. Qualification shall comprise a current (and proven) IQ rating PLUS an extra point for experience, for every year attained between the ages of 25 and 50. The qualifying total shall be, say, 170. Claimed qualifiers liable to immediate random testing.\nThis is true democracy (of the smarter, in the name of all); would be a house with serious gravitas and authority; free of parties of the lesser house.",
