        "background": "Britain has been carried too far already into the EU ethos without consultation with the people who are then deeply affected by the legislation imposed upon us by those who do not live here.  We have a workable and flexibible legal and social system which has proved very adaptable to varying conditions over time.  We do not need to have new conditions or laws imposed by unelected bureaucrats, or even elected representatives of other countries.  One size does not fit all.  All countries are unique.  Eurocreep legislation needs to be stopped.  No new charter or laws should be adopted without a referendum.",
