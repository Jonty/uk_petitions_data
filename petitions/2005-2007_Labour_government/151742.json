        "background": "SMA is extremely slippery in dry conditions for up to two years after it has been laid.  It is considered so dangerous in a number of countries that it's use has been banned yet it is becoming the surface of choice for motorways and trunk A roads in Britain. We call upon the government to ban its use until its safety has been proved under all conditions. Note: The TRL only tests road surfaces under wet conditions, yet SMA is very dangerous in the dry when motorists least expect such danger to exist.",
