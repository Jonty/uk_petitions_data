            "background": "Ever since Weston-super-Mare left Somerset there has been a steady decline in the fortunes of the town. The incompetance of first Avon, Woodspring and now North Somerset councils have all contributed to the slump of the town that was once a great place to live. The combination of poor property planning and use, traffic management and decision making regarding major projects e.g. Tropicana, Knightstone Island, Banwell By-pass have all contributed to its demise. There appears to be either corruption or incompetance in the North Somerset Council and now enough is enough.",
