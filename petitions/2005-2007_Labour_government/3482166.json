We don't fly on broom sticks, have warts or green coloured skin, we are an old, pre-Stonehenge religion that was passed as legal in 1951 in british courts of law, we therefoe have the same rights as Christian, Jew, Muslum, or any other religion and we would like to see our religion given room along side all of the others, and now taught in all British schools. Witchcraft is legal. Many pagan children, with pagan parents, now some 700,000 in England, I am sure would like their children to stop being Bible bashed and indocunated in the class room. Malcolm Tearle, Hereditary High Priest of 'Freeman Witchcraft.'",
