            "background": "Dog licenses were scrapped 20 years ago this year meaning that anyone can now basically own any type of dog and not have to tell anyone.  This leads to cruelty and dogs being bread for inhumane purposes.  I believe that dog licenses should be reinstated, along with the new legislation coming into effect on 6/4/07, in order to regulate dog owners as well as their pets.",
