            "background": "I live in a tatty village in Cornwall, and have a small two bed bungalow.  My earnings are low and my mortgage is high. The Council Tax on my home is \u00a3900 per year! I am having to juggle mortgage payments and borrow more money just to keep the council tax payments up to date. On top of all the other extortionate outgoings I'm struggling just to find the money to eat!! This tax is so unfair. I will lose my home if it goes up any more!  Charging 1% of house value will make it even worse as it will put the average tax up to \u00a31,600 per year! Scrap the Council tax and replace it with an affordable and fair (link with wages?) payment. I am making this statement as an example of many thousands of people's predicaments.",
