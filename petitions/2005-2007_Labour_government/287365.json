History has proven that prohibition is ineffective, all it does is drive up the price and place the distribution of the prohibited commodity in the hands of organised crime. The imposition of censorship for adults upon the written word or images (still or moving) produced with the full informed consent of the participants is both an affront to the notion of a free society and an insult to the intelligence of the electorate.  Censorship was originally brought in by the \u2018upper class\u2019 because they feared that if the \u2018common man and woman\u2019 was exposed to such material they would sink into such national depravity that the workforce would cease to be viable and the country would descend into sexual anarchy. The advent of the Internet over the past 20 years has meant that all of those images have been available, the social experiment has been conducted and no such sexual disaster has ensued. Censorship laws are redundant\u2013repeal them.",
