            "background": "Given the rise of the mainstream conspiracy theories regarding September 11th in the US and the impending release of a movie called Loose Change, it is time the government acted to prevent a similar situation in the UK.\n\nA search for \"July 7th truth\" or \"london bombings\" will reveal a growing movement who believe that we the public are not being told the whole truth regarding these terrible acts.\n\nThe government could step in now by answering the questions raised by such movements in an open and public debate. With the introduction of the Inquiries Act removing the power to enforce governmental investigation in the matter an open public forum would be best.\n\nKey questions;\n1. No credible explanation has ever been given for the lack of CCTV footage from Luton and Kings Cross stations, despite there being numerous references to CCTV in the official report.\n2. The official report has been discredited owing to a factual inaccuracy, namely the departure time of the train the accused are alleged to have taken from Luton to Kings Cross. This error was announced to Parliament by the Home Secretary on 11 July 2006. \n3. Prior knowledge and the involvement of Visor Consultants.",
