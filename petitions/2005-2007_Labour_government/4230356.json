            "background": "Change the way the National Lottery is both administered and it's overall structure.  The National Lottery should now be run by a Non-profit organisation.  Camelot have made their millions!  Further, make the lottery easier to win, but with lower payouts.  Instead of 1-5 people winning millions, why not have 400 players winning \u00a320,000 each and spread the rest of the winnings over a larger part of the players.  By reducing the number of balls and the number needed to win the jackpot, it would make it much more interesting to participate and watch.  Many players would rather have a decent chance of winning enough for a holiday and a new car, than an almost impossible chance of winning the millions.",
