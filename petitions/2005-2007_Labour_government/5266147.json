            "background": "I write in disgust about comments made by Lynne jones MP for Sellyoak following an incident whereby a serving soldier was abused by 3 muslim women. Comments by her such as \"quote\" \"The soldiers seem to want a little empire consisting of their own designated staff and facilities, a fiefdom\" are unhelpful and to be honest damned disgusting. The labour government seem to forget that they sent these personnel to war in the first place so therefore they should receive the best possible care and attention should they be injured. Further comments such as  \"When I\u2019ve visited the military ward it has been cluttered with staff.\" are possibly correct. You are the MP for the said hospital, therefore the NHS will lay on a show for you in order to attain future funding etc. You seem to forget that there was a recent episode where a soldier was left lying in his own excrement for hours which in my experience of working in an A&E ward points to understaffing on this particular ward. On this matter i respectfully ask for a retraction/apology from Lynne Jones or indeed an immediate resignation..",
