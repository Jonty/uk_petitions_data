            "background": "Footballers get paid stupid amounts of money to kick a ball around a field.  Half of the time they do this they do it badly.  The huge increase in clubs ability to pay these massive weekly pay packets has caused some players, Ashley Cole, to be disgusted to be only offered \u00a355k per week.  How petty, how greedy and selfish and how unnecessary.  There was a time where managers got paid more than their players, not now.  In which other profession is that the case? None.  Wages must and should be limited and the money put to better use, millions could be donated to charity each WEEK if something was done.\nSign!!! Make a difference and stop greedy footballers getting more than they deserve for doing less than they should.",
