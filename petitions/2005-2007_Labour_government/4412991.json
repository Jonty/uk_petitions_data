            "background": "After signing a few important petitions I have noticed that the confirmation email never arrives.  These never seem to be in the junk mail, they just seem to not exist at all.  I am brought to wonder if numbers on certain petitions are being artificially kept low.  e.g..  I don't want a massive mosque built with my taxes but as hard as I try my signature won't go on that particular petition.  So I ask that, if these petitions are to be taken seriously, please take our contributions seriously.  Otherwise the whole thing will just look like a 'fobbing off' of the people.",
