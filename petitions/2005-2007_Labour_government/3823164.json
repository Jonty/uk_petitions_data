            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "A report from the carbon trust showed that tidal power could provide 20% of Britains electricity. Of about 20 sites in the world where tidal power stations could be placed 8 are around Britain. \n    Building the severn barrage could provide 7% of the energy needs for England and Wales, and could be used as a replacement for many of the ageing nuclear reactors. Previous governments have abandoned the project because of initial costs which could be percieved badly by the public. It will be a brave decision to back this project, but the sooner it is taken, the better.",
