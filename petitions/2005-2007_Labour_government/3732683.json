            "background": "After Banning skating in many towns and cities in somerset and other places around the uk. I wish to prevent this becoming more commonplace, whilst the local councils may think that there are sufficient skating facilities in the town or the surrounding area there are not enough. Even if there are skate parks they are badly maintained ( i have had to have a tetanus shot after landing badly on a protruding screw in a skate ramp.) i agree that there are cases where skating could be banned for a set period of time (eg for a funeral or state event) but i think that banning the sport for an indefinite amount of time is not right.\n\nI am sure that many of you have seen the \"heelys\" which many children are on these days, why are they allowed to ride them in the streets and yet an older more mature person is not allowed to be on a skateboard or on inline skates, they do the same amount of damage when hitting someone.",
