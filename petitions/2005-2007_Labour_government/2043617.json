            "background": "There is no known cure for HIV, although treatments to control the virus and to delay/prevent the onset of Aids are improving all the time. However, there is a treatment available which - if administered within 72 hours of exposure to the HIV virus - has a very high success rate in preventing infection. This is a massive cost saving to society and to the NHS. It can cost up to \u00a31million to treat someone who contracts HIV over their lifetime, and that is only the financial cost, not the suffering and stress. PEP can eliminate this expense.\nThis is a 'no-brainer'. Just do it....please.",
