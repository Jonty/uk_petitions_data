            "action": "Create a level playing field for green energy suppliers, by banning anti-competitive 'dual-fuel discounts', since they are biased towards energy companies who include carbon based sources (gas, oil, coal).",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The existence of dual fuel discounts is a recognised bias against green energy suppliers:\n\n\"Increasingly the gas and electricity supply markets are being characterised by \u2018dual fuel\u2019 offers, with almost half of electricity and gas switchers supplied on \u2018dual fuel\u2019 contracts.\"\n\n\"Ofgem (led by Callum McCarthy) remains concerned about the barriers to entry in the electricity supply market, many of which it plans to address over the next eighteen months. However the job of the regulator is changing away from monitoring the performance of the single privatised utility \u2013 towards assessing the performance of a competitive market as a whole.\"\n\nIf you choose to switch to a company only supplying green electricity, then you will loose any dual-fuel discount since they won't be supplying gas.",
