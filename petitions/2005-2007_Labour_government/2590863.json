            "background": "Why is it that in this country, we spend out millions by providing newly entered immigrants to the UK with benefits that the UK tax payer is having to pay out for.  Every immigrant should have to pass a means test, and if they have not been paying into the system for at least 3 years, they should not be entitled to claim.  This includes immigrants brought over by relatives who are then living on hand outs by us Tax Payers.  Most tax payers will not reap the benefits of what they are paying into, but we are paying for people who have not earned this\nright.",
