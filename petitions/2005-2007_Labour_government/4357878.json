I thought the independent committee was surposed to help the government avoid the risk of  appearing influenced by third parties or local loyalties. What is the point of appointing an independent committee to decide who gets the Casino licenses, make a big public announcement and then a couple of weeks later overturn it in the Lords.",

            "background": "This vote effectively means the independent committee was a complete waste of time. It devalues the entire process and just leaves the public feeling suspicious!! So now the Culture Secretary wants to reflect on the Lords announcement and prepare new proposals. I've got an idea why don't we have and \"independent review\"!! It's a shame when the government concentrate more on the process than they do actually achieving the objective.",
