            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In many countries, a system of exchange operates for unwanted household items. Every 4 to 8 weeks, householders are invited to put out their unwanted items on a designated evening. The dates are publically available, so that anyone who is looking for items can go around and help themselves. The residue is collected by the council in the morning. I have seen such a system in operation in Germany - I was working as a Telecoms engineer, and for days after one of these evenings, people would be wandering into the labs with Videos, Hi - Fi's, etc, that they had picked up and wanted testing and repairing. Much of this stuff had very little wrong with it, and was easily put back into use, thus saving landfill. I think the councils in the UK should introduce a similar system, in order to make it cost neutral, the operating hours of the household waste tips could be reduced.",
