            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Scottish Parliament has voted for voting system called Single Transferable Vote for local government. Under this system individual wards are no longer represented by a single councillor, but larger wards are represented by several councillors. This system breaks the link between a ward and its councillor and could also lead to lack of accountability, division of responsibilities remains undecided.\n\nSTV is less democratic, If a ward has 4 places and party A puts forward 4 candidates but party B puts forward 1 candidate it is quite likely that party B could get one elected candidate and party A none, because party A's votes are more evenly spread though more in total. Labour will lose out but it is also bad for small parties.\n\nI'm confident when asked to keep the current system or have several councillors and not know who is accountable, the public would choose the current system which has worked well for centuries.",
