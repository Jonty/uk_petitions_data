            "background": "Ken Livingstone proposes to introduce a Low emmission Zone within the M25 for older vehicles not of a certain age. Those vehicles not complying will then be charged an extortionate sum, \u00a3200 per day is being proposed  and a \u00a31000 fine if not paid daily to enter into London. Why should owners of older vehicles be subject to any charge especially when they pass strict emmission test at their annual M.O.T stations annually? I suggest that by bringing in this proposed L.E.Z all Mr Livingstone will do is push the older vehicles out into the suburbs and make the emmission problem someone elses which is very selfish. Surely it would be a more sensible method to increase the emmission controls at the MOT stations and save everyone a lot of money.The proposed introduction of cameras as in the Congestion camera method to catch older Lorries is just another way to make money",
