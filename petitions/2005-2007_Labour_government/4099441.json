            "background": "Since lenders have allowed more than 3x income  to be borrowed house prices have shot up and has made it impossible for 1st time buyers to get on the ladder. The lenders have artificially inflated the housing market at the publics expense. The lenders should lend more responsibly. This may lead to a drop in prices initially until wages caught up again. Most pay raises are only 2-3%.The only person wining is the lender who uses this tactic. They can't loose just the borrower who looses everything",
