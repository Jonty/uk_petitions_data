            "background": "Road travel is a necessity for many and investment in improving the road system should be a priority.\n\nCurrent investment seems to be directed mainly toward anti car measures - namely road charging, congestion charging and speed traps rather than real investment in improving road travel.  When will the government actually use this road related revenue for the benefit of road users as apposed to constantly penalising them?\n\nThe car will continue to be the number one choice of travel for many; the government should accept this fact rather than trying to force the population onto substandard public transport.  Effort needs to be spent on improving the infrastructure and encouraging car manufacturers to switch to cleaner fuels - rather than introducing further methods of stealth taxation.",
