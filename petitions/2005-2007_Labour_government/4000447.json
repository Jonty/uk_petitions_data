            "background": "Whale meat is a luxury food in Japan. An opinion poll conducted in 1999 showed that only 11 percent of Japanese adults support whaling, with a similar number of 14 percent of Japanese adults opposing it. If the present trend goes unchecked, the IWC will once again sanction commercial whaling, putting the world's remaining whales at risk. The reason why the whaling in Japan stopped in the first place was because they had caused the numerous populations to dwiddle to dangerously low levels. THIS MUST STOP !!!!",
