Half a billion people still live in absolute poverty. \nThis tragic situation mainly occurs due to the simple fact that clean water and electricity is sparse in third world countries.\nWhilst our fund raising efforts and pressure from high profile celebrities helps, we must all get behind our government and encourage them to commit to a long term strategy that will empower third world nations to develop their own economies for the future. To achieve this, the west must support a long term objective of supporting access to all technologies that will help the third world develop clean water facilities and sustainable, cost effective power solutions.",
