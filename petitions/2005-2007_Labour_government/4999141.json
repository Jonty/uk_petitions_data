With youth, vigour and a whole heap of good ideas for or once great land, he was duly elected as prime minister.\nSince then this man has turned his back on the people that elected him, in favour of mass immigration, globalisation and become a puppet for 'Big Buissness' in order to maximise profits and drive down wages.\nHe was elected to serve the interests of the British people, and he failed to do so.  This Country has never been in so much turmoil and its all down to Mr Blair.",
