        "background": "Recent independent scientific research has shown that the current system of drug classification, and therefore the penalties for their misuse, is out dated.\n\nIf drug classification was based upon the damage that particular drugs can cause both physically and socially, then alcohol would be reclassified as the equivalent of a Class A drug.\n\nMany drugs that are currently Class A drugs are far less damaging than legalised drugs such as Alcohol and Tobacco.\n\nLet\u2019s revise the system to reflect the facts, rather than basing the drug classification system on outdated and ignorant propaganda.",
