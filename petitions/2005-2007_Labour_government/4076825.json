People all over the UK will be celebrating the Patron Saint of Ireland, drinking, parties and a national holiday in Ireland.\n\nOn April the 23rd it will be St Georges Day yet there will be no real celebrations, no stupid hats and no national holiday. \n\nAs a nation we should celebrate who we are, every other country on the planet does it so why not us? Are we ashamed? For those who live in or are from England we should celebrate the fact without the media calling us xenophobic or racist, we just want to celebrate who we are.\n\nMake St Georges Day a national holiday, if not only to give us some national pride but also remind people that we have a rich and great history.",
