Before creating any petition I look right through all those on the relevant issue; having been informed that one of mine is similar I have to spend varying amounts of time, sometimes a very LONG time, looking through ALL the petitions on that issue to try to guess which is referred to; and then resubmit mine accordingly.  I realise there are over 7,000 petitions but if it is possible to identify the fact that a new one is similar to a previous one why isn't it possible to specify the petition that is similar?",
