            "background": "Before compelling home and business owners through tax schemes, the government and local authorities must set an example.  Many people are now ready to accept that they \"need to do their bit\" but feel that unless the government is going to lead the way and set an example, then why should they bother or be forced to pay yet more money through taxation.  As an example, too many local authority, public and government buidings can be seen with lights, heating and office equipment switched on when no one is working after hours.  By demonstrating strong leadership, setting a great example and showing genuine CO2 reductions, the public may be more inclined to follow suit.",
