            "background": "Currently whenever an animal is in need of care because of ill-health or injury the cost to the caring owner is increased by the addition of VAT at the standard rate 17.5%. This means that the government is benefiting from the suffering of animals and the goodwill of concerning owners. Surely the care and welfare of animals should be deemed an essential service and not treated in the same way that luxury items such as clothing and cars are.\nAnimal owners should not be penalised for responsible and caring behaviour in ensuring their animal is treated well. All medicines are charged VAT so even preventative vaccines that are used to combat disease throughout the pet population of Britain are used to supplement the Government policies. \n\n             DON'T VAT MY CAT",
