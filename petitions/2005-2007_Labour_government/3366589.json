            "background": "I feel it is unfair that as a single parent who works hard to provide a decent lifestlye for 2 children I do not receive any benefits bar a 1/4 reduction in Council Tax and \u00a341 a month towards WTC when childcare costs me \u00a3225.00. I have always worked and after my divorce continued working, although this has been a struggle at times. I have a mortgage, standard bills, 2 children to keep and yet I receive no help from the goverment.  Single parents who do not work are receiving all their benefits plus an incentive to get back to work however the single parents who do work well appear to lose out when it comes to WTC. We are being let down as when my ex remarried the maintenance payment was reduced as his new wifes children from a previous marraige received priority which is disgraceful.  So we lose out if we work hard and we lose out if a man choses to provide for someone elses children bar his own.  All issues need to change for the better.",
