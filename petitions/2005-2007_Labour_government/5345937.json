            "background": "We ask that a law be introduced which would ban the use of sidelights as the only form of illumination on motor vehicles in times of poor visibility. Sidelights have no effect on the visibility of the vehicle by other road users. Nor does it improve the ability of the driver to see the road better. They seem to provide a false sense of security for those using them and so should be banned from vehicles.",
