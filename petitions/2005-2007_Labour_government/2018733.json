            "background": "As a tenant and an employee of a privatised housing association (formally council housing) i am disgusted at the treatment of the tenants and in particular the treatment of the staff and subsequent job lossess, not to mention the complete distain for the unions. Redcar & Cleveland Borough council and now Coast & country Housing Association have badly let us all down not to mention the corruption within the management and total lack of value for money. As i have heard with many other stock transfer associations its all money money money now they have moved over and the staff that have been there for years, even decades with the wealth of knowledge they possessed are being victimised bullied and thrown by the way side. Let me put it this way, when was the last time you saw over 600 strapping tradesman close too and in some casses crying because of the treatment delivered to them by our so called managers?????",
