            "background": "With an increase in congestion charge (in London) it is not feasible to increase public transport costs as well. With lower ticket costs as it has been (the price of a bus ticket has gone up 80p in about 2 years) the public are more likely to use it. I know I would. I like public transport, I just don't like its prices. If people were to use Public Transport more often (having been attracted to it by LOWERING PRICES) there would be LESS CONGESTION consequentially HELPING THE ENVIRONMENT.",
