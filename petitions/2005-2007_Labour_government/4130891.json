            "background": "Prior to 1975 RAF servicemen had to serve for 22 years before any pension was payable. This is unlike other public servants who recieved a pro-rata pension after only a few years.\nI, like many other servicemen, served for 13+ years and now have a gap in my pensionable years. During the 60's it became the industry norm to have pension and redundancy rights. I left the RAF in 1972 and it is unfair that the rules were changed to cure this anomaly in 1975 without regard for those who had served before. Also a severence payment on leaving was greatly increased to reflect the redundancy rules of the time.\nPlease make use of the forthcoming Pension Bill and the Early Day Motion 67 to restore our pension rights.",
