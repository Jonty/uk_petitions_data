This is discrimination (since it will not apply to cars), and also a security risk, since someone can walk past a garage and know that there is a bike inside. The DLVA proposal is to stop failings with (ANPR). These could be overcome by better policing, not additional expense which will decrease security, and still fail to solve the problem.",
