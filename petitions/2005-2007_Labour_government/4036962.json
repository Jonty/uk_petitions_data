            "background": "We the undersigned believe that the military covenant is a cornerstone of our democracy, a mutual obligation between the nation, the armed forces, and every serviceman and woman. \n\nIt is a common bond of identity, loyalty and responsibility that has sustained the armed forces - and the country - throughout an often difficult history. \n\nIn practice, this means that governments make the decisions, and the armed forces implement them. In return, the armed forces have:\n\n* the right to expect any war to be lawful;\n\n* the right to have adequate resources to carry out the tasks the politicians demand of them;\n\n* the right to be properly cared for in the event of injury;\n\n* the right to know that, in the event of their death, their families will be looked after properly.\n\nWe call on you to reconsider your approach towards our military personnel, to restore the vital covenant, and to deliver to our men and women the just and proper treatment they deserve.\n\nYours sincerely,",
