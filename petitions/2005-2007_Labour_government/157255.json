            "background": "With budget airlines reducing their prices and making aircraft travel so reasonably priced, why do the government seem so intent on finding ways to push the price up? Is it to discourage people from finding out how much better life is in other countries or do they know that people like to get away and like motorists it's an easy source of income for them. Bear in mind they have just doubled the charge....ie increased it by 100%. How can this be justufied???",
