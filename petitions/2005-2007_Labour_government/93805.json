        "background": "People on Benefits that have morgtgaes are suffering severe hard ship because they are getting \u00a3300 (aprox) less per month than those renting.\n This is causing severe hardship and making illness's to worse. Suicide rates are higher because of the geovenments' policy. Obesity becomes a problem because they cannot afford buy/ eat proper food.(I live on cereals and porrige) And eventually homelessness due to debt and having to sell their home.\nWe need a system that will give equal money to all. Those with mortgages must have the same help as those that rent,ie rent paid for them. We need the same amount to live on, not \u00a3300 short, because of mortgages.I believe this is discrimiation.\nBanks will not help even though we are told to go to them. They should be made to. \nSurely a scheme that the government gets a return of % of payments when house is sold, could be divised?\nThe payment of interest offered, after a year on benefit, is so biased, that very little is given out.",
