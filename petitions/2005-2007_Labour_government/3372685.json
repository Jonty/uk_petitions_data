            "background": "As we are currently taking so much from the European Union we should be allowed to use the European standard of numberplates (TUV Approved)\n\nThe other countries allow us Britians to have our plates in their countries we should be allowed to have their plates on our cars.\n\nA fellow Vdubber found this on DVLA site...\n\nRules for the display of number plates are set out in law, briefly these are: -\n\nA number plate must be displayed at the front and rear of motor vehicles (with some exceptions).German plates meet this requirement\n\n\nNumber Plates must be easy to read and meet the British Standard. German plates are easy to read, and meet TUV - good enough for rest of europe, why not here?!?!\n\nLettering should be black on a white plate at the front and a yellow at the rear. Can get yellow German plates for rear.\n\nThe background surface should be reflex-reflecting but the characters must not. German plates are reflective.\n\nI hope this helps your decision",
