        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Current toilet facilities in public and private places currently do not provide equality of service as the queues for women\u2019s toilets demonstrate.\nSecondly, the provision of unisex toilets for both disabled people and families (e.g. babies needing changed) are insufficient. As a father, I have been in some of the biggest shops in the country and had to queue to take my 3 young daughters to the sole unisex toilet. This inequality of access is unacceptable and with an ageing population, the needs for disabled toilets are only likely to rise. \nBuilding regulations need to be changed for new buildings so that men, women, adults with young children and the disabled have a roughly similar probability of having to queue. The same should also apply for access to changing facilities in gyms, pools etc. This week my daughters were sent to the men\u2019s changing room due to a lack of family changing facilities and saw naked men showering there. This is inappropriate, please do something.",
