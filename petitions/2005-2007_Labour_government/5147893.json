        "background": "How many drivers have been caught speeding in 30mph zones becuase they were unsure what the speed limit was? To truly slow down speeding traffic in 30mph zones why not have repeat signs that say the limit, and have them at regular intervals.\nTo pay for these additional repeat 30mph speed limit signs divert some of the money generated by the Gatsometers etc.\nProve to the British public that the Government wants to promote road safety and not be the beneficiary of another stealth tax raised via speed cameras.",
