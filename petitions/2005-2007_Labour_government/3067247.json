        "background": "The smoking ban to be introduced in England on 1st July 2007 is unenforceable, as has been demonstrated by European Members of Parliament whose protests have resulted in a smoking ban in their own buildings being reversed. They are unwilling to be told by PC people what they can and cannot do and so should we, the British public. Local councils must be stopped from wasting millions of pounds of tax payers money training 'spies' in an attempt to enforce the ban in a KGB style operation. This is Britain not a communist country.",
