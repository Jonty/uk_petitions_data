        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Staffordshire county council plan to close all the council run residential homes by march 2008. Care would go to the independant sector, many of the private homes do not meet the very high standard of council homes.Hundreds of staff stand to loose their jobs, even worse is the plight of staffordshires  old and vulnerable. Frail and vulnerable older people will have to leave the safety of their homes. Many have already endured this upheaval once before and were told they would never have to move again!!\nThe council can not possibly do this in the time scale they have set out, let alone assure residents and carers that their needs will be met by the private sector especially those people suffering from Alziehmers Disease. We were assured at the start of the changing lives agenda that some council run care would continue for the most vulnerable. These promises  have been broken in the name of cost cutting. Its not CHANGING LIVES ITS DISTROYING LIVES!!!",
