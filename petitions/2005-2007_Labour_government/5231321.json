            "background": "Many greyhounds at the end of there racing career are poisoned, shot, drowned or put to sleep. these dogs deserve better. gryehounds potentially make there owners tens of thousands of pounds in there racing career, we ask that the owners of these dogs pay for them to go to kennels or keep them themselves as pets. They deserve more than to just be \"disposed\" of. Why should many healthy dogs be put to sleep every year? greyhounds are not just for financial gain. they are animals that deserve more when they give so much. I'm sure the number of people bying greyhounds for racing, would dramatically reduce if people were made to be responsible for them for there lifetime. Greyhounds are for life, not just for racing!!!",
