            "background": "I have two issues with the policy regarding the 'Britishness' test.\n\n1) 'Britishness' is not a word and before you begin judging hard \nworking citizens of this country on the basis of their language skills \nor cultural background, we really should reconsider using terms like \n'Britishness'.\n\n2) I have just sat a sample test and scored 3/10, does this mean I should \nbe deported? This is my big problem with this test. The questions are absolutley ludicrous \nand clearly designed to exploit more and more money out of people who \nare clearly trying to make their way in life.\n\nThis is clearly another money making exercise fresh out of the Labour \nportfolio, designed to exploit the under-supported in our society. If \npeople such as myself do not speak up, nobody will. As a country we are \na disgrace, as a government, this one is beyond the limits of human \ndecency. If we insist on 'testing' those who choose to come to our \ncountry, bringing not only skills but also economy, then we must also \ntest the British people; otherwise what is the benchmark? By what \nstandard are you measuring thses people: their knowledge of this once \ngreat land or the size of their wallets?",
