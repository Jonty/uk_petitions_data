        "background": "The physical infrastructure of the RNOH at Stanmore is in a disgraceful state of dilapidation. The buildings are a ramshackle collection of unsuitable conversions, old army huts and sundry cheaply-built bits of tat. By current standards, the whole place is uneconomic to maintain (which might explain why it isn't maintained) and unfit for purpose. A visit is like time-travel to a forgotten corner of the DDR circa 1975. I defy the Prime Minister not to be ashamed of the place.",
