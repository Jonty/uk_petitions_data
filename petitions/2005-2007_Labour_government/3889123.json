            "background": "Current policy regarding illegal and legal drugs is confused, contradictory, damaging, and not working. The RSA Drug Commission suggests wide ranging reforms of the entire regulatory framework with relation to drug use. Recommending, among other things, that all drug related legislation should be brought under the control of the Department of Communities and Local Government rather than the Home Office and that all drugs including tobacco, alcohol and prescription drugs be regulated by the same bill. Any pursuit of drug traffickers should concentrate on the organisations involved rather than making seizures or trying to inhibit supply. Emphasis should be placed upon treatment and education, making rehabilitation places easier for non-criminal users to get, and reducing the harm that illegal drug use does in communities, families and society in general. That this petition is in the Public Order, Justice and Rights section illustrates the flaws in current legislation.",
