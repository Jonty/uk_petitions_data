            "background": "I am blind and teach braille on a voluntry (unpaid) basis. I do this as it is unfair for people to be unable to read there own mail. It is very difficult got blind people to afford simple low vision aids, Including talking watches, Liquids level indicators, and simple braille slates.  None of these are supplied by social services.and i know of many blind people who have burned themselves because they have overfilled cups. Also to make IT equipmenmt for the blind more affordable so that we may study and get the qualifications and careers we want. I would like Low Vision Aids to be made affordable and Braille displays to be made cheaper so that blind people can access a computer equally.",
