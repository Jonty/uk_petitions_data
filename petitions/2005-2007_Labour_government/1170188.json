We used to be able to), you have been a Prime Minister that will go down in history as being one of them.\n\nNo doubt you are looking forward to your retirement, we certainly are.\n\nYou deserve a Peerage for what bravery and fortitude you have shown against people who know better than you over matters like the NHS, Iraq and education.\n\nSuch detachment from voters deserves a seat in the House of Lords.\n\nKudos to you Tony, Kudos.",
