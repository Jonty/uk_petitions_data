The men who look at these pictures are very often sick and depraved men, who may cause real girls harm or even death.  \n\nMen like Ian Huntley, and the more recent group of three internet chat room men, relied on this kind of filth to feed their thoughts; and had the police not intercepted their internet communications, the two young sisters they were plotting to rape and murder would almost certainly be dead now.",
