        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Home Office recently reviewed the Highly Skilled Migrant Programme (HSMP) requirements causing delays to the entire HSMP application process.  Overseas doctors applying for jobs via MTAS were lead to believe that if they had a valid HSMP in August 2007, they would be eligible for interview.  After the MTAS application closing date, the Department of Health and Home Office revised this so that only doctors with HSMP before 5th February 2007 would be considered eligible for interview. Hence, MTAS applicants with new HSMP approval after 5th February 2007 have now been informed they are not eligible, with no prospects in Round 1 and no guarantee of interviews in Round 2.  This leaves the careers and lives of doctors in ruins.",
