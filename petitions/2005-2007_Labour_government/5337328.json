            "background": "I speak for the British Muslim community on this issue. The majority of Muslims agree that it was a direct insult on the Muslim faith for allowing Salman Rushdie to pick up a knighthood. We agree everyone has a right to freedom of speech. But when you attack people\u2019s faith it is felonious and hurts which is what Mr Rushdie did in his book The Satanic Verses. This has caused rage to millions around the world. By giving Salman Rushdie a knighthood it has outraged the whole Muslim world and this certainly isn\u2019t the way to build bridges with anyone let alone Muslim communities. If this knighthood is stripped from Salman Rushdie it will show tolerance and possibly help build ties. This may also compensate for some of the anguish that Muslims have suffered as a result. It is now a big test for the UK to show its true nature on how it acknowledges the feelings of not just its Muslim citizens but Muslims worldwide. The Muslim world is watching very closely.",
