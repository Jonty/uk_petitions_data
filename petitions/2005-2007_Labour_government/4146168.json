        "background": "The idea for free travel during the day makes sense regarding reducing school car runs however even this causes problems with packed buses, children just getting on for 1 or 2 stops, older people not able to get a seat and intimidation of other passengers. However, free travel is not needed in the evenings where on numerous occasions I have seen gangs of children from areas they do not live in, pour off a bus and start vandalism, kick bins over and hang around intimidating the local public.",
