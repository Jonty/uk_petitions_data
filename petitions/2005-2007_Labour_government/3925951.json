        "background": "Today many families have for example an utterly ungovernable teenager and ask for help. However if those families seem to be acting to improve the situation themselves regardless of their success, the social services have been known just to dismiss their pleas for help although in some cases there has been repeated criminal behaviour that looks likely to continue. i should like for it to be very difficult for the social services to dismiss any case especially if they ask for the help they need to keep today's youth from following a criminal trajectory.",
