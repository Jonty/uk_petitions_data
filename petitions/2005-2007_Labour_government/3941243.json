            "background": "Local Education Authorities are able to reject free travel of pupils to local schools on grounds of a persons religion. \n\nThe rejection of free travel on the grounds of faith is wholely wrong. It has no place in a 21st century world, and certainly not by a public body which is also responsible for ensuring such abuses do not occur (religious discrimination).\n\nOnce a pupil has been accepted into a local school we believe they should have the same rights as any other pupil attending that school, and not be discriminated against on grounds of faith.\n\nAllowing free travel to school for all would also be consistant with reducing congestion (and accidents) around schools and fit a joined up thinking approach to a councils planning.",
