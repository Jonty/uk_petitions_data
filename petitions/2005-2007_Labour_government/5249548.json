            "background": "Israel: the only Middle Eastern country that shares our democratic rights and ideals. Scrutinized and demonized, recently the NUJ and UCU decided to boycott Israeli goods and academics. \nThis is certainly not the attitude that a developed Western country should be taking towards a country like Israel. Not only is it ill thought-out and stupid, it is also highly detrimental to the peace process and reeks of discrimination.\nIt does nothing for the British public. It does nothing for Israelis and certainly does nothing for the Palestinians.\n\"38 journalists arrested in Iran; 700 activists detained and tortured in Zimbabwe; 400,000 murdered in Darfur... and BRITISH UNIONS have singled out ISRAEL for BOYCOTT. THAT'S ANTI-SEMITISM.\"\nWhen will these so-called academics - supposed to be the most intelligent in our society - realise that the most brutal human rights abuses are occurring far outside Israel? When will Britain accurately see the facts?\nI thank the Prime Minister deeply for his recent condemnation of the boycott, and urge Government and all Members of Parliament to follow suit, joining this voice of disparagement in denouncing this biased and unfair attack.",
