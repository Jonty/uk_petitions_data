            "background": "Dear reader, many thanks for taking time to read this.\n\nI have been nursing for 17 years and whilst a person does not enter into the \nprofession of nursing for the monetary rewards, isn\u2019t it reasonable to expect to \nreceive a moderate wage with pay rewards that are at least in line with the \nrate of inflation?\n\nMany would agree that we enter into this profession because we want to make a difference to the lives of those people that we come into contact with. It is the right of patients to receive whole-hearted, compassionate and conscientious care not only on an individual basis but for their families and carers also. \nOn a personal basis, my care does not stop when my shift does. I have never \nput my excess hours down as overtime, neither have I asked for remuneration \nin any way from our glorious NHS. Isn\u2019t it therefore reasonable to ask for a \nfair wage increase?\n\nIf you agree, I ask for your support by adding your name to this growing \nlist, and once again thank you for your time.",
