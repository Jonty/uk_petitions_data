            "background": "Former Australian cricket player Ian Harvey has had his application to become a British citizen rejected due to a very minor offence committed in April 2007.\n\nDue to this offence the Home office rejected his application to become a British citizen despite having lived in the country for now over 5 years with no previous criminal activity and despite having a British wife.\n\nThis rejection now threatens to make him unemployed as he is not registered for Derbyshire CCC as an overseas player as he thought he would gain his citizenship. This also prevents him from representing England if he were required, which could be the case during the 20Twenty cricket world cup later in the year as he has proved he is highly skilled in this form of the game.\n\nSo to save his career we the undersigned petition the government to reconsider his application for British Citizenship.",
