            "background": "This petition is designed to reduce road congestion, which is a fact beyond arguement. The Government's proposed method of tackling the problem is viewed as being unacceptable by a large number of people. By introducing a greatly increased minimum driving age, we will initially reduce congestion and as a secondary benefit will curb the growing trend whereby young drivers are responsible for a disproportionate number of serious/fatal accidents.\nThe increase in the minimum age should be annually incremental.",
