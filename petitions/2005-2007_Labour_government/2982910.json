        "action": "Rather than use Road Charging to reduce road congestion, reduce the number of vehicles on the roads by increasing the minimum driving age annually in one year steps. The eventual aim being to prevent anyone under 21 from driving on UK roads.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is designed to reduce road congestion, which is a fact beyond arguement. The Government's proposed method of tackling the problem is viewed as being unacceptable by a large number of people. By introducing a greatly increased minimum driving age, we will initially reduce congestion and as a secondary benefit will curb the growing trend whereby young drivers are responsible for a disproportionate number of serious/fatal accidents.\nThe increase in the minimum age should be annually incremental.",
