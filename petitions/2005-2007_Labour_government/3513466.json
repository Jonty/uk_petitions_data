            "background": "After some Ipswich games you can be waiting for up to an hour in traffic. However if more Park & Ride services were running just before and after games (particularly evening games), that would get Ipswich fans to and from an area near the ground and back to the Park & Ride Station it would be used by the majority of people who would otherwise come in by car. Not only would this mean more money going into public transport and a less congested Ipswich but it would help decrease pollution and even further help Ipswich Town Football Club\u2019s current bid to become the first carbon efficient club.",
