            "background": "I believe that house and flat prices are too high because there are too few properties for sale. Homeowners are reluctant to move because of high stamp duty costs, particularly in the South-East. If stamp duty were abolished then homeowners would be more willing to move (trading up and down), property prices would stabilise, the economy would become more flexible (as people moved for work) and we would all be a lot happier.",
