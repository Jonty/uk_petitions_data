No matter how much the jury are directed to ignore anything they read in the papers and concentrate only on what they have heard in court, in practice most people can\u2019t identify which bit they gleaned from where, and they assume that what is in the papers was what they heard in court \u2013 even if the papers have misreported evidence. Banning any reporting before conviction / acquittal will automatically stop this happening. It will also have the effect of protecting the accused but unconvicted from vigilante attacks.",
