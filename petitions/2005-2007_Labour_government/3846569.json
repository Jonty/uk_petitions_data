        "background": "make it compulsory for all curry houses to employ there quota of ethnic minorities eg, English. I am very disturbed that you think that this petition could be humorous. I want to make a very serious point.Businesses are compelled to employ diverse peoples. Indian, Chinese and Turkish restaurants among others can flout this with impunity. This seems to me to be racial discrimination and something should be done about it. It is far from funny it is deadly serious. Please treat my petition seriously.",
