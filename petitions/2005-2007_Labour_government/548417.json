        "background": "Up until recently,UK school children have been routinely tested for immunity of TB and immunised accordingly. This would be the reason why TB does not appear to be prevalent in the UK.\nIt now seems as if the only children who are going to be offered this procedure routinely,are those who may have been exposed to or have relatives that may have been exposed to TB.\nThis does not seem like a safe choice to make due to the amount of immigrants entering the UK at the moment,some of, which come from areas where TB IS prevalent and some of,which are illegal and would not have been tested for TB even if such constraints were in place.\nAlthough it is meant to be illegal to spit in the street,many folk do,hence any germs within that spit could be transferred elsewhere. So,even if your child does not come within close contact of a TB carrier, (who may not even be aware that they have TB themselves), They may still be at risk.",
