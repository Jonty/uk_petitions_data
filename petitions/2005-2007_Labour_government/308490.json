            "background": "As of October 2007 it will be illegal for 16 and 17 year olds to purchase tobacco.\n\nThe government has deemed it bad for their health. Indeed, but it also bad for 18 year olds and 28 year olds and 58 year olds. It should be a personal choice. 16 year olds know the effects of smoking better than older generations from being taught in school. They\u2019re legally responsible for their own medical care and health. If they can choose to reject cancer treatment, they should be able to choose to smoke in the first place. \n\nIf 11 year olds are smoking now raising the age to 18 will make no difference. Only 23% of children aged under 16 who tried to buy tobacco found it difficult to do so. Evidence shows that nearly 70% of 11 to 15-year-old smokers say they buy their cigarettes from small shops such as newsagents and corner shops. Possibly the ban will make the situation worse. Teenagers will feel their freedom is being taken away and might even be more likely to rebel and smoke.",
