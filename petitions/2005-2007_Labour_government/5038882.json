        "background": "Allow Americans resident in the UK the same driving licence exchange as drivers from EU countries have. Drivers from the United States of America should be allowed to exchange their licences for the UK driving licences, just as drivers from other EU countries can.  Drivers from many EU countries overall, are no more qualified/skilled than American drivers. If the driver can show his/her driving record as being safe (police, State, or insurance record) for a period of 5 years or more, than they should be allowed the exchange privilege without the practical driving exam requirement.",
