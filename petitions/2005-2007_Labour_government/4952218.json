            "background": "Many women find that from shop to shop the size of clothing they buy can be completely different. In some instances, different ranges in the same shop can have different sizings forcing women to choose a garment one or two sizes above. Some women can end up buying clothes from a range of shops spanning three or more dress sizes. This encourages low self esteem and faddy and irregular eating patterns as women strive to fit into a smaller size. It can also exacerbate existing eating disorders.",
