Anjamanje is a religion that takes all the best bits from each religion and combines them into one love filled kingdom. The way it works is pretty much when you die you get your 40 virgins then there is a kind of ant/earwig tombolla to see what path you take when you reincarnate. depending on what animal you chosse depends on how long it takes for you to come back, e.g. you pick an ant you come back straight after you have worked your magic but if you pick a lion it takes much longer and you have to spread out your \"time\", why do you think there is so many ants and so few lions, see clever. This will solve all the countries problems, and this is not just my opinion. Tommy McFly, who may exist, says \"Brilli-ANT\"",
