        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Given the vast differences in salaries in the UK, we need a greater number of tax bands to prevent low- and middle-income tax payers from being proportionally worse off in comparison to people earning \"super\" salaries. Currently, someone on a salary of \u00a333,301 and someone earning \u00a3250,000 pay the same amount of tax (40%), placing a disproporionately high tax burden on the lower earner.\n\nAt the moment the UK only has 3 tax bands: \n\nStarting rate of 10%\nBasic rate of 22%\nHigher rate of 40%\n\nCurrently, people earning more than \u00a333,301 pay income tax at 40%. \n\nIt is proposed that the threshold for higher rate taxation should be raised to at least \u00a350,001, and that there should be an additional \"super high\" 50% taxation on people earning more than \u00a3100,001. \n\nPeople earning between \u00a32,151 to \u00a333,300 pay basic rate tax at 22%. This rate should be divided to make the bands more evenly distrubuted. Therefore it is proposed to reduce income tax for those earning under \u00a320,000 to 15%, and increase to 25% the income tax on people earning between \u00a320,001 and \u00a350,000.",
