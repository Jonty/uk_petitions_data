            "background": "By growing oil crops on 'set aside' land, we can produce enough bio-diesel to power 40% of our current diesel requirement.  \n\n\nThis would:\n\n1) Replace carbon emissions from fossil fuel with '1 year carbon neutral' fuel of an organic nature.\n\n2) Reduce the balance of trade deficit by producing a large percentage of our diesel, witihin the country.\n\n3) Reduce the amount of green house gas put into the environment by not having to transport fossil fuels from abroad.\n\n4) Provide farmers with a high value crop, where their land is currently idle.  There will also be a direct knock on effect from the economic multiplier.\n\nAlso....\nBio-diesel is organic and less harmful to the environment in the event of a spillage.",
