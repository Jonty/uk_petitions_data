        "background": "I object to the fact that two main routes from Wales into England are owned by the French.  British structures such as this should be owned by the British.  We all pay a toll to use these crossings which should sustain the cost of maintenance.  If they are to remain French properties, then stop investing british tax payers money in them, and make the owners pay for the maintenance instead of making profit from the poor motorist!",
