        "background": "We want to leave the European Union. Only having a referendum will allow us to do so. We are not against federal unity; in fact that is exactly what we want - We need to be united in the face of this dangerous and turbulent world. \nThe question lies with whom we should be united with, not whether we should be united. Being united with our Commonwealth brothers and sisters, particularly Canada, Australia, New Zealand, is the only appropriate way forward for Britain.\nThe EU is an undemocratic and old-fashioned, outmoded bloc with a similar governance to that of the Soviet Union. Britain needs to get out of that old rut and be part of a real progressive, forward-thinking and democratic federal system, where each Member State is equally represented and Hebeas Corpus is upheld. With us all in the CANZUK having the same culture, the same language and ways of behaving, our unified government would run smoothly and we would be a powerful player in world affairs.",
