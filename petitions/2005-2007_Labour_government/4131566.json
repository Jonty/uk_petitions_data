Fuel costs have risen considerably since then + employees are now not being fully recompensed for using their own vehicle for business use. \nAlso, encourage 'alternative fuel' vehicles by increasing the payments per mile for alternative fuel vehicles. There are costs involved with buying these cars, so employees should be encouraged away from diesels + petrol vehicles.",
