This is the most undemocratic tax of all!\nApparently it is to 'discourage non serious nominations' Surely it's up to the electorate to decide who's serious and who isn't?\nJust consider: If you have a spare \u00a3500 you can dress up as a lobster and get on TV... what a great democracy!\nAbolish the election tax!",
