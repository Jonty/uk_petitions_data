            "background": "Police to actively stop/fine pedal cyclists from cycling on pavements at all times. Pedestrians are increasingly at risk from cyclists who are unable to react to pedestrian meanderings.\nWhereas the sensible cyclist  wears a helmet and protective clothing, pedestrians should not have to do so to walk down the pavement safely. Very few cyclists have insurance and pedestrians being knocked down on pavements who subsequently have to take time off work have to stand the cost themselves.\nReturn pavements to the haven they are meant to be for the elderly, children and the pedestrian.",
