However, on occasion there arises an issue that is so overwhelmingly unpopular that we feel it necessary to speak out.  National Road Pricing is such an issue.  \n\nWe the undersigned pledge that we will not support the Labour Party in any election - be it general or local - if they insist on pushing ahead with plans to introduce road pricing, or any similar new fee-based system levied on road users.  Instead we will cast our vote for whichever party most threatens the local Labour seat.",
