            "background": "The \u00a3200 winter fuel payment for the over sixty-year-olds is very welcome, but has been at this rate for years; not taking into account the steep rise in fuel costs of the last three years. This payment should, therefore, be increased because pensions have only had very small rises each year; certainly not in line with the cost of living or pay rises.\nI am informed that fuel prices for the home have increased by over 93% during these last three years alone.",
