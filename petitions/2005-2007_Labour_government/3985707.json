This set a great precedent for British football with Manchester United winning the Cup a year later. \n\nAlex Fergusson was a awarded a Knighthood for winning the trophy, so why can the Late, Great Jock Stein not be awarded the same? Afterall he did it when the odds were against him with a team of guys from very nearly the same city and no foreign influence. A truly remarkable achievement.",
