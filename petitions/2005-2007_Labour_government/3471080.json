It forms part of a comprehensive set of measures to be introduced in connection with an initial 5 year programme for wide ranging local improvements that has already started. This includes measures to support regeneration, improve safety, promote walking, cycling and public transport, enhance access to the transport network for those with impaired mobility and protect communities from adverse traffic impacts.\nAny body who has been anywhere near the area will know how badly this bypass is needed.",
