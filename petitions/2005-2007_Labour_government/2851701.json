            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\nCB radio users in the UK used to have 2 very distinct frequency allocations; 27MHz, and 934MHz.\nWith the advent of mobile phones, our 934MHz band was taken away from us, but has never been used since.\nThe proposal is that we are given a frequency allocation in the UHF TV band, as the advent of Digital TV will free up some of this part of the radio frequency spectrum.\nA suggestion of 476 - 477MHz is made, this would enable the use of readily available UHF CB radio equipment (subject to approval) such as that used in Australia.\nCB radio is still a very popular form of communication,  and its popularity is increasing since 27MHz CB Radio became license free in December 2006.\nThank you, and 73's (best wishes in CB lingo !)",
