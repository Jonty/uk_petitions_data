            "background": "Would Britain have invaded Iraq without the US? NO. Why did we invade Iraq? Because Mr. Hussein started tradding oil in euros. Why should the US, a country which spends the majority of its money on the military, get more money for doing nothing? What we want is for the world oil trade to now be done in British Pounds. We therefore ask MR Blair to do the right thing and make a bid to the world bank to have all oil transactions made in British Pounds.",
