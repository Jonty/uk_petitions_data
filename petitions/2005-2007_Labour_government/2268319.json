Allow them to be governed in an open, honest and transparent way free from stealth and unwarranted taxes. Allow individual enterprise to benefit society by not persecuting and demoralising the soul of an individual with a system that appears to take from the poor and give to the rich. Put Great before Britain not tax.",
