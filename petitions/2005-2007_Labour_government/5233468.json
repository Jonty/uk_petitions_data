            "background": "To introduce speed cameras within 20mph zones. Every day I see vehicles zooming up and down the road where I live at speeds well above 20mph and I don't see any traffic officers ever enforcing any 20mph speed limit.  Where I live a 20mph zone was introduced because there have been too many traffic and speed related accidents in a residential area.  I'm sure every 20mph zone have these same problems and some sort of reliable speed limit enforcement is needed, otherwhile what's the point in having 20mph speed limits and zones?",
