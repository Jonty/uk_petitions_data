        "background": "Birmingham Council is to sell land adjoining our primary school to build a 3/4 storey block of flats. The land has been used as public open space for 30+ years. It is grassed with mature trees protected by a Tree Protection Order.  The proposal removes the open aspect of the school and builds a 2 m wall along the school boundary.\n40 members of the public, the School Head Teacher, two councillors and the MP formally opposed the application.  \nThe Planning Committee visited the site, meeting the applicants, about 30 members of the public and local Councillors.   Committee members shared residents\u2019 concerns; some wished that the area could be left as open land.  The Committee asked the developer to review the application to take account of local concerns.  The applicants have declined to discuss alternative proposals with local residents. \nPlanning Officers recommend approval. They consider the proposal has no adverse impact on the area\u2019s character and appearance and that it is in accordance with the UDP and supplementary guidance.  Residents believe the guidance has expired and the development will have a deleterious effect on the environment and quality of life locally.",
