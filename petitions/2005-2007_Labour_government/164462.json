        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present no one is being held responsible for the criminal behaviour of under 16's.   Recently I have learned of an unprovoked attack by two underage boys on an innocent youngster.   The boy almost died due to his injuries, yet, neither the offenders, nor their parents have been charged.  I am suggesting a system where parents be held responsible for their child's behaviour, particularly in serious cases such as the above and in less serious instances, such as minor vandalism, theft or breach of the peace, that a system be enforced that the parent recieves one warning to ensure they keep their child supervised at all times - or else face criminal charges if said youngster is found to have re-offended.",
