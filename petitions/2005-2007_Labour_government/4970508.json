        "background": "We believe that the United States of America is too immature to be trusted with its own independence. Their innability to elect an indivudual of suitable intelligence to govern themselves, and in doing so damaging the rest of the world, is initself an example of this fact. \n\nUpon revocation of independence, the USA will be required by law to start using the English language in a manner in keeping with a higher degree of intelligence, and will no longer be able to use words such as \u201cwhatever\u201d and phrases such as \u201cthat is sooo\u201d as they clearly can not be trusted with such things.\n\nFurther more, the newly colonised USA will be alowed no form of representation in government. It might be worth mentioning also that this does not exclude them from the requirement to pay a tax levied on them at the discretion of the British government; which in turn will be elected by the British people only. \n\nFurther to this, coffee will be banned and citizens of the united states will be forced to drink the contents of Boston harbour.",
