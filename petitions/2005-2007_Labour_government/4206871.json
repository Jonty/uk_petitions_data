            "background": "The country is currently experiencing issues in respect of obesity and the associated medical problems which is causing an inordinate burden on the NHS. This trend should be reversed and the population should be encouraged to join fitness clubs to reduce the problem primarily by exercise as well as diet control. Having a tax incentive to join such clubs will go some way to achieving this aim and although costing the government in the short term will significantly reduce the potential cost to the NHS in the long term.",
