            "background": "Women who have worked all their life and paid NI Contributions at a reduced rate, have consistently been robbed by government. I have paid over \u00a370000.00 in contributions and my return in state pension is 10p per week. Women who have worked part time and therefore not paid any contributions are entitled to a full pension. How can that be deemed to be a fair system. This is particularly frustrating when you read of all the benefits asylum seekers and such like receive.   Now I am 60 and only able to get 10p a week who will be responsible for me, I do not qualify for any benefits as I paid reduced contributions, so I have to carry on working until my husband reaches 60 in 5 years when we will get married couples pension.  I would like the government to look into this matter again and do the decent thing and give us back some of their ill gotten gains.",
