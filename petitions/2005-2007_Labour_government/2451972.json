            "background": "The M6 toll road (Birmingham Northern Relief Road) was granted planning permission because it promised to relieve the traffic congestion on the main M6 motorway. However due to very high toll charges hardly any traffic uses the toll road, and the main M6 motorway in the Birmingham area is just as congested as ever. Therefore the M6 Toll road is not fulfilling it's original stated purpose, and consequently it's planning permission should be withdrawn.",
