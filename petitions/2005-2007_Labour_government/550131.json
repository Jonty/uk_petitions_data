By attempting to manipulate the media message, the Government underestimates the ability of the public at large.  By doing so, it breeds the mistrust of the public, and goes a fair way towards undermining democracy in the UK.\n\nOf course, we appreciate that this isn't an issue solely for the Government.  However, it would be nice for once if they lead by example for a change.",
