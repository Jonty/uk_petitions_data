With a population in Britain estimated as in excess of 8 million, domestic cats could be killing 275 million creatures a year.\nBell-wearing cats killed fewer mammals, though bells seem to offer little protection to birds. However, a survey carried out by the British Trust for Ornithology showed that a sonic collar which emits a regular signal, reduced the number of birds killed by 65 per cent.",
