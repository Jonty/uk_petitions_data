        "background": "The job of the monarchy is to watch over the elected officials and prevent them from eroding democracy. The monarchy are the official owners and rulers of England, and serve to remind the government that they do not have absolute power over the people. Instating Jeremy Clarkson into political office would be undemocratic, and also might distract Him from His Top Gear duties. Instating Him as King of England would allow democracy to flourish under His Rule, but also enable Him to restrain, for example, the over-eager department of transport.",
