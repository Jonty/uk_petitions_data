        "background": "The cost of staging the olympic games has spiralled from 2 to 10 billion pounds in 2 years. The Olympic ideal has long discredited itself by corruption,and commercialism. The Olympic games are now just another commercial sporting event which should be paid for by the spectator, not the taxpayer. Get 'Sky' and other international television networks to pay for the games, not the National Lottery and the exchequer. The IOC should be paying for the games, and if that cuts them down to size, so much the better for the whole world.",
