        "background": "On 31st January 2006, Chichester girl Charlotte McKenna was announced as FHM Magazine's High Street Honey.  Chichester, in West Sussex, isn't really famous for all that much so Lloydie from Power FM has had the idea of putting up a statue in her honour.  Joined by his co-host Katie, they are trying to get Chichester District Council to get a statue of Charlotte put up.  We urge the Prime Minister to use his influence to help achieve this aim.",
