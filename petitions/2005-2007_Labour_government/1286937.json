Chichester, in West Sussex, isn't really famous for all that much so Lloydie from Power FM has had the idea of putting up a statue in her honour.  Joined by his co-host Katie, they are trying to get Chichester District Council to get a statue of Charlotte put up.  We urge the Prime Minister to use his influence to help achieve this aim.",
