            "background": "It has long been known that Rhapsody of Fire, innovators in the popular genre of filmscore metal, have been yearning to come from their native Italy to play a series of stadium gigs here in the UK but alas their genius cannot be seen in venues better than music bars in Southend on Sea. The time has come to rise up and bring these metal gods to the great heights where they belong and where better than the newly completed Wembly stadium. And to sweeten the deal further, rumor has it that if Rhapsody are ever to play here they would be accompanied by actor Christopher Lee, who features on some of their albums, words cannot express how important a musical and social event this would be so I urge you, do not let this opportunity pass you by, bring Rhapsody of Fire to Wembly now!",
