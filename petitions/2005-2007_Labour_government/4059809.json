Who else can show such sympathy to old ladies who have just had a one billion pound gas bill?  Who else sells more tickets to his live shows at Symphony Hall than the latest teen sensation?  Who else gets the region looking for lost budgies, dogs and jumpers?  Ed provides so much pleasure to so many people and really is the 4th emergency service in the West Midlands and therefore deserves more than his MBE!  A knighthood is all that will do!  Oh yeah, and one for Boyden please PM....",
