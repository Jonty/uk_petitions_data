HOW CAN THIS BE REASONABLE. Simply the 3% threshold should only apply to the value in excess of \u00a3250,000 therefore for a property purchased for \u00a3260,000 stamp duty should be paid at 1% of \u00a3250,000 and 3% of \u00a310,000 therefore making the total due \u00a32,800 instead of \u00a37,800.",
