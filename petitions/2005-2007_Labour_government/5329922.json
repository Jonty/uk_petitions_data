Since she came into service in 1969, she has undertaken 25 world cruises, has crossed the Atlantic more than 800 times and has carried more than 2.5 million passengers.\n\nWe call on the Prime Minister to stop this sale to Dubai, and place the QE2 in UK waters so that she may enjoy her retirement, and reveal her majestic wonders to the worlds tourists who visit the UK.",
