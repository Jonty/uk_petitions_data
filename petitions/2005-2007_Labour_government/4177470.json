            "background": "Whilst we appreciate it is no one's fault that women are built with the need to use sanitary protection monthly, i am sure you all will agree it isn't the woman's fault either. Why should women have to pay this expense from their own pockets, when it is something beyond their control.Women are tax payers to and why should they be penalised for something they cannot help? If there are any males of this country arguing at this minute why should they help fund this expense, im sure it will be much cheaper than funding the extra child benefit that would be incurred as the result of women preventing this unavoidable monthly occurence.",
