            "background": "The Act of Settlement (1701) specifically discriminates against all of Britain's Roman Catholics, stipulating that the British head-of-state and his/her spouse cannot be Catholic.\n\nAt a time when peace has broken out in Northern Ireland it would be a huge gesture of reconciliation to abolish this Act now.  Indeed, how can anyone expect the near million or so Catholics in Northern Ireland to respect and profess loyalty to the British state and its institutions when they are so blatantly discriminated against?\n\nNo, the Act is an anachronism and should have been abolished long ago.",
