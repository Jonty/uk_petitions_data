        "background": "The ongoing U turn on HIPs has been brought about primarily by the failure initially to attract surveyors to train as Home Inspectors and latterly by the failure to recruit sufficient numbers of Energy Inspectors. Within it's brief the enquiry should investigate whether \n1. the department was aware that they would be unlikely to attract surveyors in the numbers required, in that there was little support for the scheme from day 1, therefore wasting public money\n2. the accusation that the department has been giving false estimates on the numbers of surveyors recruited as Home Inspectors and Energy Inspectors and has consequently mislead parliament and the industry\n3. the accusation that through mishandling of this affair, small business's and individuals have lost considerable sums of money paid on wasted training packages and \n4. payment of full compensation to those who have directly lost money on wasted training and acreditation",
