            "background": "The Playstation 3 is an expensive new games console yet to be released in Europe. Sony has delayed the release in europe to concentrate on Japan and the USA which is blatant discrimination towards the people of Europe.  The PS3 offer very little innovation but has copied a lot of things from existing consoles such as the motion sensing controller technology of the Nintendo Wii.  Many people have said that Sony are using the PS3 to gain dominance in the new DVD format war by incorporating a Blueray drive in the PS3. Help stop Sony from releasing this money grabbing piece of non essential equipment and help those family's who cannot afford such an expensive gift but will give in to their children's demands.",
