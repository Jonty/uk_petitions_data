            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I would like to see the government stop convicted criminals from being able to claim legal aid whilst serving their sentence in prison. If a person has committed a crime and subsequently been sentenced to a custodial term, then their right for the state to help them with any kind of appeal, law suit or compensation in the form of legal aid should be rejected. Why should the tax payer subsidise criminals legal fees when they have disregarded and broken the law in the first place.  If they wish legal representation then as a result of their conviction they will have to pay for the legal aid with their own money. Its too easy for criminals to sit in their cells and think of ways to claim compensation etc. and not have to pay a single penny towards the cost of the legal process. Its time for the goverment to start getting tough on the law breakers of this country.",
