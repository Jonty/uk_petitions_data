        "background": "Working parents are increasingly under pressure to meet both work and school dedalines. Today their is a massive and growing demand for the provision of pre and after school supervision of children, in schools. This could be run by the school or an outside body, in the school and could be funded by parents or a mix of government support. Today, teachers do not see this provision as part of their teaching role and the progress of provision is stonewalled.Parents are not asking teachers to provide supervision, but for some kind of facility to be made at a place where children are already located...the school. Current pre or after school care often means relocation of children, is frequently over subscribed and as a result very expensive and not within the pocket of a great many parents.",
