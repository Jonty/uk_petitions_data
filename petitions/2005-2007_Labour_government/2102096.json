            "background": "Implement a scheme where genuine people can legally pay off a percentage of the debt over a longer period & (providing the smaller payment arrangement is adhered too) the creditor must start to show these payments on the credit record. \nSo helping people reduce the stress surrounding such times, whilst allowing the debt to be paid. \nThis would reduce the horrendous charges put on by some companies, even though the debtor is continually paying an amount they can afford. \nThis would also reduce the use of \u201cbullyboy, underhand\u201d tactics employed by some debt collection agencies, which employ the \u201clack of clear legislation\u201d as a means to add out of proportion charges.\nThis would also help genuine people get their life back in order after such trauma as a marriage breakdown, quicker than if they are forced to become blacklisted/bankrupt & in some case moved to depression/suicide.",
