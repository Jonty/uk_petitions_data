            "background": "For the past couple of years now, many have noticed a change in the UK, and the way it has been run. Much of this, I feel is becasue the Govenment is doing too much to please people of other religions, etc.  One example that springs to mind is Easter holidays/Christmas holidays, these are being changed to Spring break/Winter break. I see no need, this country consists mainly of caucasian, christian people, and in no way am i saying that this is the only people that should be in the UK, but that we should keep this country's traditions, and stop trying to alter them to suit people of other ethnic minorities.",
