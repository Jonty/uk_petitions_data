            "background": "In this day and age the UK is quickly falling behind our colleagues in other countries around the world with respect to high speed data services to the homes and businesses.  By opening up the current UK infrastructure and forcing BT to share ducts and encourage other service providers to lay their own infrastructure offering consumers real choice and competition can we then move forward. \n\nEncouraging the use of technology to benefit the public with eHealth, local community security and access to fast internet services at low cost.\n\nTo long has BT controlled the infrastructure in the UK doing very little to benefit the consumer and breaking the back of the infrastructure while gaining large profits and very little investment.  \n\nRemove the Universal Service Obligations from BT which it users as an excuse for it's own infrastructure being installed on new developments.",
