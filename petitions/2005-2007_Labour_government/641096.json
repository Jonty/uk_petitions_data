This allows one section of motorists carte blanche to flout the law with no way of identifying them. Surely that is an unfair situation allowing most road users to be caught but allowing motorcyclists to be un-policeable.I feel that is an infringement of my civil liberties as a car driver to be persecuted while another group of motorists is untouchable by this technology.",
