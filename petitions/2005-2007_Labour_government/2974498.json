The current speed limits were put into place in the 1960s when 70 mph on a empty motorway would be fast enough, however in the present day, 40 years later i feel that 90 mph if enforced correctly would be more suitable, especially if used in partnership with the variable speed limit technology that is used on the m25. Simalar speed limits in Europe work as a high speed limit is viewed more as a \"limit\" than a \"target\".",
