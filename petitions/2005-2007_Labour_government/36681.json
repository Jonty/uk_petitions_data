The majority of MPs (80 to 85%) would continue to be elected on an individual constituency basis, with the remainder elected on a corrective Top-up basis which would significantly reduce the disproportionality and the geographical divisiveness which are inherent in FPTP\".\n\nThere are some good alternatives to pure PR which combine FPTP and PR to give a workable, more representative system.",
