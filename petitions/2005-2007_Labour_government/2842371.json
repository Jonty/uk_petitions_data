In any free & open society, people must be able to express their views or challenge any accepted wisdom, without fear.\n\nThis government has done more than any other to erode our ancient right to Freedom of Speech. The criminalisation of any view or idea & the application of moral imperatives [political correctness] is inconsistent with Democracy. It should be the people who tell the government what to think & not the other way round!\n\nWhether through arrogance, idealism or fear.. this government has brought us closer than any other to an Orwellian nightmare.",
