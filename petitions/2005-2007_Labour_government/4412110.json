            "action": "recognise that Britain has lost its way in the world by its puppy dog politics vis a vis the Bush admistration and self engrandisement, and therefore request the Prime Minister to (a) announce a withdrawal from Iraq (b)  bolster the funding of our armed forces at home (c) commit positively to nuclear power (electricity stations and trident replacements) and (d) work closer with our European partners who have an equal voice in tackling the so called \"war on terrorism\".",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "(a) The current situation in Iraq where British servicemen/women and 100+ of Iraqis killed every day because of our illegal occupation means that we are in a \"Vietnam situation\" where we have absolutely no control in the region and are playing with the lives of local Iraqis and our service personel\n(b) Our armed forces are being asked to defend your Govt's wars with de minimus equipment; in addition there is limited planning to increase spending given we are \"fighting a terrorist war\"\n(c) this has got to be the greenest agenda; France has no problem with it (d) the diplomacy of our European partners have totally been sidelined in the \"fight against terrorism\".  We have followed blindly behind the Bush administration in believing that the attack on 11/9 was also an attack on European institutions and ethics.  You and your Bush cronies fell into the snare's trap, which has also resulted in the July bombings in London. Incidentally the other city to be attacked was Madrid, previously a supporter of Bush's \"War on terrorism\"",
