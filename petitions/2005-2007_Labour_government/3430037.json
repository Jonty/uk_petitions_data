            "background": "The government wishes to encourage more people to use public transport. However with rising bus prices it is actually CHEAPER to use your own vehicles in a lot of cases. Most companies are trying to make profits. If the government took over the control of this and added more funding it would reduce public transport prices and encourage more people to use them!",
