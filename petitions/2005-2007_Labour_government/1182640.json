If it were a new invention it would never get a licence for public sale in the modern world. \n\nThe government is making steps in the right direction by banning smoking in all public places from this summer but could take it a step further by banning actors (from this point forwards) from smoking on television. This would stop sending the message to youth and others that smoking is acceptable or that it is cool. It is neither, it is stupid and dangerous!",
