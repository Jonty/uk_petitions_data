            "background": "Parental responsability is currently only given to mothers unless she is married to the father when a child is born.\nI propose that this is changed so that bothed named parents are given equal rights to a child.\nThis has a couple of benefits\n1) It would reduce the time it takes to process Child Support claims, as it both parents have taken responsability for the child/children involved.\n2)Currently, if an unmarried father has to leave the child/children in their mothers care, due to a relationship breakdown, the procass for access can be long and drawn out due to the fact that the father would have no rights to the child whatsoever. With parental resposabiity the process can be speeded up, and the child/children will benefit from the presence of both parents.",
