In 2006 a survey of graduate unemployment showed that 86% of the 2006 year nearly 2,500 graduates in England failed to find permanent positions.  In Scotland the figure was 91% and in Northern Ireland 85%.  In Wales the figure a little better, with 68% having failed to find permanent employment.Taking account that a new student cohort will qualify in 2007, the government needs to take urgent action to substantially increase the number of Junior Physiotherapist posts in the NHS.",
