        "background": "Plaistow station have installed new indicator boards on 3 platforms. At first they were working fine, but by after a few months down the line, the indicator boards stopped working for the last year. (don't explain next train info)\n\nWhy would the London Underground maintainence staff take down the old boards that were working & replace them with new ones that aren't working?\n\nAlso most stations near Plaistow have their indicator boards working such as West Ham, Becontree, Mile End, Embankment, etc but not Plaistow.\n\nI have e-mailed the London Underground many times about this problem & their response is that it will be sorted or \"upgraded\" in 2010!!! (What kind of response is that?) \n\nI am asking you, the public to sign this petition to get this problem put right.\n\nThank You.",
