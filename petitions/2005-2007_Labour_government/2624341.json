            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I have had to move from my hometown of Holt,North Norfolk,due to the cost of housing in relation to an average Norfolk salary and demand for holiday homes.The only chance I have of returning has been wiped out by the LPA as my Aunt gave me a plot of land which had OPP on it previously but since then the development plan has changd and the LPA will now only allow a holiday home,not a permanent one. The LPA hide behind policy and Ruth Kelly's department have said they do not get involved with local planning issues. To add insult to injury the LPA have given PP to build a carpark nearby, even though that is outside the development boundary and destroys a few acres of greenfield!!I hope that my petition will highlight the flaws in planning policy, get my case reviewed and help local people like myself being able to live in the hometown that they love and not get discriminated against compared to second home owners.",
