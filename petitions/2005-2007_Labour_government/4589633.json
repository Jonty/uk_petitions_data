            "background": "In March, the Leeds Teaching Hosptials Trust mothballed their 2004 commitment to a new children's and maternity hosptial in Leeds, which was due to open in 2012. The reason given for halting the plans was purely financial, after estimates for the new hosptial escalated and pressure was placed on the Trust to save \u00a330m next year. Representations have been made to health ministers and the Trust, but no further news on progress has been given. It is time to let the Prime Minister know how strongly the people of Yorkshire feel about the need for this new hospital.",
