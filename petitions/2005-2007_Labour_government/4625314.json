            "background": "Daily we experience, or hear of, the devastating effects lack of funding in the Health, Education and Care services have on our own, our loved ones and others lives.  Superbugs in hospitals, \npatients with critical, terminal or inhibiting illnesses being denied the best drugs for their condition on the grounds of expense; schools relying on supermarket vouchers for essential equipment to educate our children and Councils such as Staffordshire closing Residential Day and Respite homes and Centres because of lack of funding.  It is a known fact that every country hosting the Olympics to date has made huge losses with the tax payers and residents bearing the financial burden inflicted as a result of a few kudos seeking individuals. Perhaps if we start spending money where it is needed - in years to come we will have a population healthy, wealthy and educated enough to compete stage and benefit from hosting an Olypics event.",
