Since then the UK has not created a legal framework that allows children (and or their guardians) to exercise these rights.\n\nThe Convention gives children basic rights with respect to education, protection and health services. \n\nIn particular, the incorporation into British law would ensure children have a legal channel to exercise their right to an education that \"ensures the development of the child's personality, talents and mental and physical abilities to their fullest potential\".",
