            "background": "Originally the right to buy was introduced to both allow lower income familes to get a foothold on the property ladder and at the same time plough the monies raised to go towards building more homes to house those who needed them. this hasn't happened and there are more and more people who need homes or better homes and their only choice is to rent from extortionatlly priced private landlords who a lot provide poor housing. (so do some local authorities). Force all local authorities to build a lot more or renovate empty buildings (as they do abroad) to supply more homes for the increasing population who can't afford to buy and to make sure ALL rented properties are safe and suitable at reasonable rents.",
