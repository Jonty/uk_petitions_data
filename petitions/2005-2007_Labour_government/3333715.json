        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Youths are completing their HMP custody and released with their names taken off the education role, often entered into the care system, No mediation between families, Little victim awareness and little, if any anger management issues, are addressed. There is no aftercare unless the child has severe mental health issues or severe substance misuse issues. (Very few children are even diagonoised with this until after the age of 18yrs). Please ensure ex-offending children do not become instutionalised and re-offend because they have not been provided with the after care they require to change their criminal behaviour. IE a education, learning right from wrong, a family. I work with young offenders and see them re-offending continiously. Please change this!!!!",
