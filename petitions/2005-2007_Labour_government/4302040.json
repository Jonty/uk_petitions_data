This deception is an IMPORTANT aspect of bad policy on the Government's behalf and the contempt they are showing for the electorate.\n\nWe petition the Government to either:\n\n1) Give all the money that is raised in fines to charities - so that the motorist will not mind paying the fines, as we will know that the Government is not greedy\n\n2) Make the punishment have nothing to do with money, and everything to do with safety, such as lessons in driving, or having to take your test again.\n\nIf they will do neither of these, then explain why the Government will not, and why these devices should not be called Greed Cameras.\n\nNobody thinks this is humourous, this is very serious.",
