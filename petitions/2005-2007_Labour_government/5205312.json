            "background": "Already a controversial issue within 24 hours of its announcement, the alleged \u00a3400,000 logo for the London 2012 Olympic Games is viewed by many, including myself, to be anything ranging from an embarrassment to our country and our capital, a waste of public money, irrelevant, dated and something that could be outdone by the contributions in a primary school competition.  In no uncertain terms, this logo is poor and a new logo, or a reversion to the much better logo used throughout the bidding process, is necessary if Great Britain and London want to have a logo (or a \"brand\") that reflects the majority's pride in hosting the 30th Olympiad in 5 years time.",
