The assumption that lowering the minimum age at which longer jail sentences can be imposed indicates to people in the UK that the Prime Minister is out of touch with the grim reality of life in the domain under his control.\n\nWe call on him to remove all limitations as the age of the person pulling the trigger is immaterial to the person who has been shot and killed or seriously injured.\n\nWe also call on the PM to remove the burden of bureaucracy from front line police officers thus enabling them to spend a minimum of 75% of their time available for duty physically on the street.\n\nIf anyone other than a bureaucrat considers the paperwork useful then it should be done by properly trained civilian employees and/or retired police officers.",
