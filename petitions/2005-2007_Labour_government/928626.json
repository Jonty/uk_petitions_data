            "background": "to enable smokers to enjoy their rights to leisure and a social life. A more sensible policy would be to allow bars, pubs, restaurants and private members clubs to apply either for a licence to allow smoking or non-smoking establishments and then choose staff who smoke to work the \"smoking\" establishments and non-smoking staff to work the \"non-smoking\" establishments.  This would give everyone a fair choice! This would also create employment for smokers who are being shunned in the workplace because they smoke.  You cannot force people to give up.  Remember prohibition in America in the 1920s.  There are approximately 12 to 15 million smokers in this country and they deserve consideration.",
