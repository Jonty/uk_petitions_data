        "background": "The British Taxpayer should no longer be expected to fund this ego trip for our politicians and the great and the good. The projected costs of hosting the games are now projected at nearly \u00a310billion and given that building works have yet to be started in earnest, these costs are likely to rise even further. The overburdened British Taxpayer should not be expected to fund this project any further and given that is unlikely that private sponsorship or the lottery will cover the costs it is clear that it is time for London to withdraw from its committment to hosting the Games.",
