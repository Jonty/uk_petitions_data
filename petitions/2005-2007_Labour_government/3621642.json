This often means that they (and their heirs) lose their home and all their capital worth.  This is perverse when one considers that a criminal who receives a custodial sentence is not required to contribute to the cost of his/her prison acommodation.  Examples who spring to mind are Lord Archer, Lord Brockett and Jonathan Aitken all of whom had retained their wealth upon release from custody.",
