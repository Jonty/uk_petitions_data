        "background": "Elderly, law abiding people, who have been thrifty all their lives and often own their homes outright, currently have to pay for their residential care if their health deteriorates.  This often means that they (and their heirs) lose their home and all their capital worth.  This is perverse when one considers that a criminal who receives a custodial sentence is not required to contribute to the cost of his/her prison acommodation.  Examples who spring to mind are Lord Archer, Lord Brockett and Jonathan Aitken all of whom had retained their wealth upon release from custody.",
