        "background": "I propose that traffic wardens throughout the uk should not wear hats as part of their uniform.  The reason being that i feel that this gives them a sense of authority that they do not actually possess.  Many a time have i been confronted by these so called traffic officers who acted like they actually believe they are part of some high ranking law enforcement agency,  Me and many people i know belive that this action will bring them down a peg or two and actually make them a little more polite when dishing out parking tickets and fines.",
