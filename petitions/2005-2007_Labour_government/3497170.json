            "background": "Many companies have devised simple methods of breaking down water into its basic components of Hydrogen (H) and oxygen (O). A company in Canada has devised not 1 but 2 ways of achieving this. H is a very efficient fuel source and has the added benefit, when heated, of re-attaching to O making it recycleable. Why is this not the only fuel source we use? Could it be that we would have no further need for Oil, Gas and Electricity companies? How would the government recoup the lost tax revenue? Is this the true reason for the road pricing policy?  Serve the people Mr Blair and not vast Corporations! Do the right thing!",
