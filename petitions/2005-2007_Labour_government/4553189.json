            "background": "After the events of 9/11 the observation decks were closed. These were great for the planespotters who frequently visited them. These decks included a shop where you could buy items such as model aircraft,aircraft videos and airband scanners. They also included a coffe shop. In the summer many people came to these observation decks. Nowadays you are not even allowed to watch aircraft from the car parks. Planespotting is enjoyed by many and is a great way for poeple to get out and enjoy themselves. please repeal any ban on planespotting in civlian airports. Please do something as although terroists do exist the majority of british citizens are not terriosts and never will be. Even if extra safety measures are put into place please open the observation decks and allow planespotting at any civilain airport.\nfeel free to sign if you agree.",
