            "background": "Every year the govenment presents a budget that is unfairly aimed at single parent families, or to a lesser degree, low income families with children, whilst taxing single people to cover the additional income metered out.  The only sensible course of action would be for single men to get married and have children, and for single women to have children. Thus making them better off by means of tax credits and state handouts. This is not encouraging young people to strive for anything better, as the state will unfairly tax them to pay for those who cannot work due to child care commitments, or choose not to as they are better off on benefits. We petition the Government to stop taxing single people unfairly",
