        "background": "Sky have recently announced that they intend to remove Sky 3, Sky News and Sky Sports News from Freeview and replace them with a new terrestrial service that is completely incompatible with existing Digital Terrestrial Television services.\n\nThe majority of the available Terrestrial television spectrum, both before and after the digital 'switchover' should be ring-fenced for free-to-air services only. Legislation should ensure that less than 1/3 (33%) of any available Terrestrial Television bandwidth is available to subscription TV services.",
