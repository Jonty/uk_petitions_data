Claims it will help protect the environment by tackling the greenhouse effect are nonsense. It is simply another tax on holidays and the freedom of movement. The reality is that air travel contributes less than 2% to global CO2 emissions. The sensible answer to cutting pollution from aviation is to tax carriers that fly outdated polluting aircraft and to reward those - including the UK and Eire budget airlines - that operate the latest low emission modern aircraft.\n\nThe Government should accept that budget air travel is no longer a luxury but a basic form of transport that is often more efficient than other forms of transport since plane loading levels are such that they do seldom fly with wasteful empty seats.",
