        "action": "Ensure the national minimum wage applies to all workers and not discriminate against younger workers who are paid less for the same work.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The national minimum wage is a fantastic policy which works to ensure decent wages and economic opportunity for those on low income. It prevents employers from exploiting their workers by paying them shockingly low wage rates. However, the major flaw in this policy is that younger workers are discriminated against purely because of their age. Surely it is not justifiable paying a 16 year old \u00a33.30 an hour for doing the same job as a 22 year old who is payed \u00a35.35 an hour(currently). This is unfair exploitation which indicates that younger labour is less valuable and younger people are of less worth than someone 4 or 5 years older than them. Young people at 16 may be living independently, may have children, may be married (in Scotland) or may be supporting others. This policy also discriminates against older workers in that faced with the choice of paying a worker \u00a33.30 an hour, or \u00a35.35 an hour for the same labour, businesspersons will aim to maximise profits and therefore discriminate against older workers. i therefore petition to eradicate these discriminations and introduce a standard national minimum wage for all workers which values all labour, and people, equally.",
