        "background": "Seriously, speed cameras are not about speeding, but raising tax.  They should be renamed \"Greed cameras\" in all Government documents and on the road signs, UNLESS the punishment for speeding has nothing to do with money (e.g. have mandatory road safety lessons), or unless the government gives the money to charities instead.\n\nUnless the Government can explain why the punishments are about tax and money, then we will continue to believe these cameras are about Greed and not Speed.",
