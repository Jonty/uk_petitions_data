        "action": "introduce legislation to ensure that all power stations, wind turbines and wave, tidal and solar power schemes have the carbon dioxide emission involved in their construction offset in advance by the planting of trees or other biomass crops.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The fabrication of concrete, steel and other materials in order to construct power generation plant, plus transport and assembly of these materials represent a large negative \"capital investment\" in global warming. To ensure sustainability, this should be offset in advance by additional vegetation in the UK, consuming at least that quantity of carbon dioxide before the power plant is started up. In the case of planting short lived biomass crops, this should only be permitted where sufficiently large additional biomass fuelled power generation capacity is created within a reasonable distance.  Power generating companies should be able to count this generation capacity towards their renewables obligation.",
