        "action": "Force printer manufactures or enable competitors to price replacement ink cartriges at cost + small profit margins",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present manufacturers of domestic computer printers price their printers artifically low in order to recoup profits on replacement cartridges. These cartridges are now chipped to show ink levels and thereby cause copyright issues if copied( Epson 600 and Canon 4200 for example and others did not require chips to show ink levels ). This stops genuine competition and legal action is now pending against ink providers stifling competition. Prices of a single set of replacement inks can cost the price of a new printer including a full set of inks. Given the goverments targets on greenhouse gas emissions are strict surely it must be a gross missuse of resources for it to be cheeper to buy a printer complete with full set of cartridges than to replace the cartridges.",
