            "background": "Prices of holidays during the school holidays increases dramatically, discriminating against families.  This is a petition to prevent holiday companies increasing their prices during these times.  \nSchools are currently stopping children being taken out of school for holidays during term time.  Most parents only take children out of school during the term because they cannot afford holidays at any other time.  \nIf we took away the initial problem of the price increase, it would benefit:\n1)schools - resulting in higher attendance \n2)parents - fairer, affordable prices and less chance of prosecution for unauthorised absence.",
