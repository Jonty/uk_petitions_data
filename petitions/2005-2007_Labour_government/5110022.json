The process would require attending an annual interview where a trained benefits fraud team will assess the genuine need for a claimants receipt of benefit and/or note if their situation has changed (as opposed to costly \u2013 surveillance, or random enquiry checks which currently take place).  A mandatory annual interview will help to reduce benefit fraud, by (a) identifying genuine claimants exist, by making sure they are seen in person, checking ID's etc (b) assessing their right to claim, and the effort they are undertaking to \u201cget off benefits\u201d  etc. (c) will \"send the message\" that benefits are something to be \u201cjustified by those is genuine need\u201d (and not just given out to those who think they have an automatic right) (d) generate jobs for people who are undertaking the checking (e) reduce the high cost of surveillance, legal action related to prosecuting fraudulent claimants (who don\u2019t have the money to pay the fines).",
