            "background": "How many times do we as individuals see vast duplication of effort and waste in public sector.  Common sense seems to be the rarest commodity of all.  Why is it obvious to most but not to those in charge who could prevent such duplication and waste.  We need to: \n1. Enshrine a culture of non duplication into working practices\n  2. ensure cross departmental and functional and agency analysis of lessons learned, projects underway to challenge and test existing and new programmes for overlap in objectives, benefits expected and inter dependency\n  3. We should not tolerate the professional avoidance tactics of individuals with vested interests, typically they are \"our requirement is unique\", \"there are special needs\", \"the timescales are different between each intiative\" - on and on it goes.\n\nSimply put there is a lack of realistic integrated planning, this means we pay repeatedly for the same thing over and over again.\n\nLets stop the waste and frustration that duplication brings.",
