Episode to episode shows fighting, arguements and deaths.  I feel that as these are shown in the erly evening, our children are subject to veiwing this.  I do not think that it is suitable viewing, especially at that time in the day when something more productive like documentaries or even a light hearted movie could be shown in its place.  I do feel this is a matter that needs attention.",
