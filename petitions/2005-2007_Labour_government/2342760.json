            "background": "Time and again we attempt to address the consequences of a problem, but fail conspicuously to address the cause. For instance we are now seeking to create more prison places, but failing completely to reduce the need for them. Children are now to be offered operations to control their problems with obesity, but are given no help with their diet, or in resolving the issues that lead them to overeat in the first place. We are able to offer a few lucky youngsters places on drug and alcohol abuse treatment courses, but there are neither sufficient places, nor any attempt to eradicate the root problems that cause them to stray in the beginning. It is costly (both financially and in lost lives) and utterly pointless continueing to treat the symptoms without finding a cure for the problems.",
