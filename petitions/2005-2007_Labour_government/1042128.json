        "action": "Give each citizen a carbon quota which can be traded, if not fully utilised, in order to stop the wealthiest citizens from benefiting from global pollution through non-progressive taxation.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is clear that, whether proven or not, climate change is to be the next mechanism for substantial taxation of the wage and salary earner. When flights and travel are heavily taxed then the essential liberty of free movement becomes regularly available only to the wealthy or the privileged. It is not unreasonable to ask that the wealthy and the poor should contribute to the reduction in pollution but it is unreasonable to restrict the movement of the poor to a greater level than the wealthy. We would like to petition the Prime Minister to think about his responsibilities to all his constituents and give a carbon allowance to each citizen, at whatever age, which can be used or traded for income by them and in this way reduce the inherent unfairness of the anticipated new system.",
