            "background": "The television license system we have in this country for funding the BBC is unfair.  The BBC should fund it's programmes by advertising like the rest of the channels on air.  The TV license is an out-dated idea, we should move with the times and scrap it.  It's getting more and more expensive and is harder for people on low incomes to afford.  A lot of people rely on television for accurate and up-to-date information so it should be free to the masses.  Having to watch a few more adverts is a small price to pay for abolishing the license fee.",
