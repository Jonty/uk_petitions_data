EU Membership has also brought huge benefits to the lives of everyday people in terms of Human Rights and equality issues. This is totally beside the fact that there has been no war in EU Europe since 1945. A vigorous campaign of real education - rather than tabloid misinformation - must be mounted to help those people calling for Britain to leave the EU to realise that to do so would be a hugely damaging step for our nation.",
