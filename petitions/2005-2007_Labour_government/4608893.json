            "background": "Gurkha's have served the British forces with loyality and dedication for many years, yet we as a country treat them poorly and with inequality.\n\nmembers of the regiment who served in the Falklands are not entitled to a pension, after service they are treated like illegal aliens.\n\nThis it totally wrong and unacceptable.\n\nI ask that they willingly risk their life for our well being and should be given citizenship as a matter of principle as no country could ask more from an individual and these people are proven good members of our society and we will deeply benefit us as a nation if we give these men and women automatic British citizenship",
