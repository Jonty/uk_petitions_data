            "background": "It is a perfectly legitimate position to feel that, although one is not apathetic about politics, there is no point in casting votes in an election if none of the available options reflect one's views.\n\nI call for the introduction of an 'Abstain' box on all ballot papers so that those of us who do wish to exercise our right to vote, but who do not wish to actually contribute to the vote count of any candidates/parties, can be included in the figures for voter turnout.\n\nThis would hopefully lead to a rise in voter turnout figures and would give voters a method of rejecting all of the available options should they desire to do so.  Those of us who do not wish to vote for any candidates/parties are currently written off as apathetic and/or uninformed.",
