            "background": "I am opening this petition as I find it extrememly unfair that as a 19 year old male, I am only entitled to \u00a34.45 an hour.\n\nI work and live in London. I am struggling to lead a healthy life on the amount of money I am paid each week.\n\nI like anybody else pay council tax, rent, need to buy clothes/food. Yet because I am under the age of 22 I am expected to live my life on breadline.\n\nI don't receive any special discounts, all my bills, clothes, food and needs are the same. Surely this is a case of age discrimination.\n\nI would be extremely grateful if you people out there can help us \"YOUNG ADULTS\" by backing this petition to have the minimum age for the ages 18-21 to be matched with 22 years plus.\n\nMany Thanks\n\nStephen Walters",
