If anything, it should have come before 'civil partnerships' in the pecking order.It may have gone on as long as 'living together'. I believe couples who have/intend having children should be married, but surely those who are too old or choose not to have kids are entitled to the same securities as those for whom it is biologically impossible.End this discrimination now!",
