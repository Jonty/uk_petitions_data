It needs to be scraped and replaced with a sensible and safe solution to the unaceptably high motorcycle accident rate. The only purpose that the current test scheduled for 2008 will serve is to make it extremely difficult to obtain a licence. The number of accidents during training and tests is also likley to rocket.",
