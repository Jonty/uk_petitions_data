            "background": "2000AD was first published in February 1977.  In its 30 years of publication, ably edited by Betelgeusian Tharg The Mighty, it has published early work of a huge number of artists and writers who have gone on to become major names in the comic industry, such as Alan Moore, Brian Bolland, Dave Gibbons, Grant Morrison, Francis Irving and Andy Diggle and in doing so has helped put British comics talent on the world stage.  It has inspired generations of people, including filmmakers and musicians, with its (seldom preachy) stories reflecting on science, war, politics, totalitarianism, racism and religious bigotry.  Frankly, if a few more politicians read it, the world would probably be a better place!\n\nSo come on Mr Blair, pay your respects to an alien whose legacy you could only dream of having!",
