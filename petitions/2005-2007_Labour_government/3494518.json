BTW, I\u2019m not \"intending to be humorous.\"  I am aghast at the things which appear here.  \u201cWine in restaurants costs me more\"; \"this kids sweater is scratchy;\" my burger doesn't look like the one in the picture\". Oh yes - \"MFI sell rubbish kitchens.\"  I'm not talking about the ill-informed, aggressive views that many people seem to have - usually ending with \"let's put the Great back in Great Britain\" - but the aimless whining. I have attempted three petitions - all rejected. Daily Mail readers have their views accepted no problemo - asylum seekers, single parents, such easy targets, aren\u2019t they? Finally\u2026if this is rejected because \u201cthere is an identical petition\u201d there isn\u2019t because I\u2019ve checked! And yes, I am requesting action! Bet you a fiver this is rejected - again! p.s. - this was initially rejected for being \"intemperate\". Compared to the hate-filled petitions that are accepted? Get a grip!",
