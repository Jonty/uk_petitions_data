            "background": "Initiate the establishment of a memorial to the child labourers of the era of UK industrialization - perhaps in the form of a statue of children, boys and girls, from the cotton mills, coalmines, agricultural gangs, and other industries, indicating the direction of the House of Commons. \nHundreds of thousands of British working children - often described as child politicians by contemporary observers - lived their short lives in the most abominable of circumstances. The purposes of the memorial include:\n i) The recognition of the immense cruelty inflicted upon children in the UK until parliamentary legislation led, by the end of the 19th century, to nearly all children under 11 years of age being in school and therefore excluded from full-time labour.   \nii) The recognition of the immeasurable enhancement of public welfare brought about by dedicated reformers despite often hostile public and parliamentary opposition.\n iii) The possibility that the memorial will assist in focusing national and international attention on reform in the many countries of the world where child labour persists.",
