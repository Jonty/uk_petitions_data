Having come from an battlefield environment, these troops will find themselves in surroundings which are alien to them as well as disorientating.  The special needs that they have both medical but just as importantly psychological will not be met.  Often they find themselves surrounded by people who have no understanding of what they have gone through or worse are positively hostile to the aims of the particular campaign the soldiers have been involved in.\n\nOur injured troops not only deserve the very best treatment for their injuries suffered whilst serving their country they deserve that treatment in specialist units which are staffed by military staff for soldiers .",
