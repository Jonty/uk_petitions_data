            "background": "Many people who take class A drugs like ecstacy/cocaine/crack are just normal individuals looking to have a good time and maybe at times get caught in the wrong crowds. I am petitioning as a plea to our government to not just tar everyone with the same brush. i.e. all class A drug useres are horrific people always out for their next fix. And instead of heavily prosecuting such people, at least help them and concentrate more on rehabilitation.",
