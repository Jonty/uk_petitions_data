        "background": "Currently, Sheerness and the Isle of Sheppey is part of Swale Borough Council, as such all the council tax padi by Islanders is split between the Island and the mainland. Consequently, the Island suffers greatly. We would like to get this changed so that the Island is responsible for its own funds, rather than having to go to Swale Borough Council for issues that are massive to Islanders, but mean nothing to others, so get no funding.",
