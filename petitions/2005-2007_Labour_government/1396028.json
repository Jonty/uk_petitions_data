            "background": "this petition is being assigned to ask if the british troops out in Iraq, or being deployed can be withdrawn, some of the british troops have just coem out of basic training and are at their most vunrable.  Please sign this so we can make sure our troops are getting the care they need for when they return, mentally and physically.  as well as more information for the families of those who are serving, make us more involved in operations.  If the troops have to stay out there, then please let them have the proper training and not just a few weeks. they need proper equipment, insted of asking us at home to send them boots, etc etc because they dont get them supplied. we need to know whats going on, and be kept informed 100%. we dont want to hear second hand on the news about whats going on out there, we want to know whats going on from the local units, not the local news channels. If our troops are not prepared mentally for Iraq how are they supposed to cope when they return?",
