        "background": "Former Home Secretary Charles Clarke has made a statement that use of the National Health Service should cease to be free at the point of use.  In other words we would have to pay to see a doctor or be treated in hospital.  Not only is a free health service nothing less than right, it has been a point of pride for this country since the day the Beveridge Report was published.\n\nWe already pay for the health service: charging again for medical treatment at the point of use will result in health provision even more steeply tiered than it already is.  Essentially, the poor will go without.  This is a policy which should be rejected without any pause for reflection by this and any other goverment.",
