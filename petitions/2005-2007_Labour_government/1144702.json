            "background": "The UK Government has persisted with independant government in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland without paying heed to the wishes of the people of England.  \n\nThe English are expected to subsidise all three countries, and yet have had no opportunity to express their opinion. We would not, as alleged, be weaker without them but would in fact be far stronger.\n\nThe Governments suggestion for resolving the West Lothian Problem is unacceptable.  The creation of a seperate tier of government in the form of an English parliament would simply create more jobs for poltical cronies, more waste and soak up more of our hard earned, easily lost taxes.\n\nBy signing this petition you indicate your support for regaining control of our own parliament and finances, and ending the subsidy of our ungrateful neighbours.",
