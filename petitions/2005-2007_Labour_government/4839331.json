        "background": "This petition is, I hope, fairly self-explanatory. No snooker player has ever been knighted: where better to start than the wonderful, witty and interesting Mr Davis? Knighting Steve would recognise not his decades of service and entertainment. It would also underline the importance of graceful and celebral snooker to the citizens of this great country.",
