He has put smiles where there were only frowns, moistness where there was only dryness, amazement where there was only normality and sporting excellence where there was only dourness\n\nHe is truly a beacon of light in a world of darkness, and has raised money for countless bar owners and late night takeaway houses around the country. He has saved many woman from the arms of lesser men.\n\nDo the right thing and we may forgive Iraq!",
