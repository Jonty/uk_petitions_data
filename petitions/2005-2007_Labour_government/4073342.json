            "background": "Basically, people who are bedridden because of their weight are physically unable to go out and buy their own food. Therefore, someone is obviously purchasing the daily food they consume and feeding them. Surely this is an obscure type of assisted euthanasia, simply because they have control over what that person eats (e.g. the Publicans Act 2001, where the landlord is responsible for patrons alcohol ontake when it comes to drink-driving). Please create a law to make these people more responsible for their well being.",
