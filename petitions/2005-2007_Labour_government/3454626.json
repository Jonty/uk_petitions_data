Some of the sign language people are far too big and distract you from the actual programme, some of them have a great big border around them reducing the size of the picture.\nHas no one thought about a new type of feature on a televison where a deaf person would press a button and the \"signer\" would appear, alot like subtitles.\nOr at least order the removal of the oversized border they sometimes put around the screen, as i have seen on many BBC Broadcasts, most notably on the childrens channel.",
