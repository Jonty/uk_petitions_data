            "background": "thousands of people in the uk are imprisoned because of lack of toileting and changing facilities in our public buildings. Those with severe disabilites and complex needs cannot use standard disabled toilets. The cost of extending these and providing changing benches is minimal if undertaken when the building is being constructed or refurbished.\nSimple legislation to ammend building regulations would mean freedom at last for thousands of disabled people and their families and carers. Changing Places is a national campaign whose aim is to make this happen. please support us . thanks",
