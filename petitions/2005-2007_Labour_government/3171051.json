Business rates are out of control. What are these rates used for? I have already been in touch with the Deputy PM office and even their they could not tell me what it is for. It is time that this issue is cleaned up and for the government to explain. It's hard enough to run a small business. But with all these taxes it is almost impossible. You are suppose to help and I think that we are being pushed out of our business.",
