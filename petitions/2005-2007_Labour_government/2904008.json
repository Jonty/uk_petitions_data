        "action": "Abolish lower age limit or re-instate pension entitlement to 50 year olds",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As an hard earning tax payer I have saved as much as I could afford into a private pension scheme to ensure that I could retire at an early age and enjoy my pension from the age of 50 if I wished to do so. Gordon Brown changed the rules so that we all now have to wait until we are 55 to claim our private pensions.\n\nYet again those who have chosen to sacrifice the present to ensure that thier later years of life are enjoyable are being punished. When we took out our private pensions we all asumed that the contract that we were entering into was binding and therefore expect the goverment to withdraw the current rules and re-instate to the previous and contractual obligation\n\nWe therefore petition the goverment to allow 50 year olds who entered into a private pension scheme that allowed them to take their pension at 50 be allowed to do so as per the contract that they had entered into or refund in full all their pension contributions to be reinvested.",
