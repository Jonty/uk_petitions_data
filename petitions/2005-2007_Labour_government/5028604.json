        "background": "The current government introduced new legislation removing the right of sperm donors to anonimity. This has led to a chronic shortage of donors throughout the country. For a couple requiring donor sperm for fertility treatment there is now little hope of ever finding a donor. Research has shown that this could be cured at a stroke by allowing donors to remain anonymous.",
