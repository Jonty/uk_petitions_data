            "background": "Despite the Prime Minister being so keen for all school leavers to continue to higher education, enormous tuition fees are expected to be paid by attendees. Dispite offering loans to fund these fees, it is expected for students to pay interest on the the amount that are required they borrow. We the undersigned believe that student loans should be interest-free and for the government to stop charging in line with the retail price index, and instead for student to only pay back the amount that they origially borrowed",
