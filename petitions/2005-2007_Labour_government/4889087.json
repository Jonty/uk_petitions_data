        "background": "The town of Reading has undergone massive commercial expansion over the last 20 years. It is now the regional centre for the Thames Valley and beyond. However, as Councils in Newbury, Wokingham and South Oxfordshire control its outer suburbs, vital decisions concerning the future of Reading cannot be undertaken locally, but are subject to the dictates of neighbouring authorities.\n\nGreater Reading, with a population of c 240,00 is recognised as the largest urban area in Britain without City status.  Recent attempts to gain such status have revealed that the Borough, which has a population of c140, 000, is considered too small for this honour.\n\nRedrawing the Borough boundaries would thus allow the people of Greater Reading to manage their own affairs and for the eventual grant of City status to one of the most successful and forward-looking urban areas in Europe.",
