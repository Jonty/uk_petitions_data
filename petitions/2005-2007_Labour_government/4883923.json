            "background": "A previous government made provision for road worthy vehicles of 25years and older to recieve a free road fund licence disc.\nThis was in recognition that most older vehicles were usualy 'second' vehicles and so saw very little road use whilst being maintained usualy by enthusiasts to a higher standard than a family saloon.\nOne of the first things the 'new labour' government did was to stop the rolling 25 year programme at August 1973 - all vehicles after this pay the full cost whatever their age. I request that this be revoked and the 25year rolling programme be reinstated as intended.",
