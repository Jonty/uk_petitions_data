            "background": "Much has been said by the pro-hunting industry stating that many livlehoods are affected by the hunting ban and anyone who disagrees are mis-informed.  Why then do they not answer simple questions such as:\n1.  What are the total annual, costs to keep all horses and dogs for hunting?\n2.  What is the gross annual income for the industry?\n3.  What is the gross annual Profit/Loss?\n4.  What is the annual tax paid to the treasury?\n\nIt is suggested,costs for horses and dogs far outway the income from kills each year and the true reasons for hunting are a morbid sense of cruelty that remains within the UK, although the Industry insist they are civilised and it is for the environment.  \n\nIf you agree with the Hunting Ban, please sign to show the government that we are the majority, not the hunting lobby.",
