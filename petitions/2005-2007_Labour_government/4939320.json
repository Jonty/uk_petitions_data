It may sound frivolous but I'm hoping you will accept the feel good factor of helping some of the local people have their say, and bring back some joy. There was a short period in the not too long past when there existed a wonderful treat for your taste buds - Prawn Cocktail Hula Hoops! I'm sure if any of the Cabinet has tried them, they will agree with me. Please allow me to try and gain some public momentum to bring back this refined, sophisticated, mouth watering experience to our lives.",
