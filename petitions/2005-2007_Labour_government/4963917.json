            "background": "We are highly concerned at the arrest and detention of Tasneem Khalil, a journalist and human rights activist in Dhaka, Bangladesh by the non-party 'caretaker' Government which is meant to ensure free and fair elections. Khalil works for the Daily Star, and is associated with international organizations of repute such as Human Rights Watch and CNN. He is a staunch defender of human rights and an outspoken critic of human rights abuses. If there are no charges against him, we urge that he is released immediately. Further, we strongly condemn such arbitrary arrests and other attempts at intimidating the media, since it runs counter to the very reform the Government want to see.",
