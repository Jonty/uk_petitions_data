This should not include respectful disagreement of the lifestyle, particularly in the Church.  \nChristians, though we disagree with the acts on Biblical basis, love this group of people and care deeply for their needs.\n\nAllow those who have come out of this lifestyle the freedom to say how and why they did (and there are many of these), without fear of condemnation. \n\nAgree respectfully to disagree respectfully.",
