        "background": "Kenneth Arthur Dodd OBE (born 8 November 1927, in Knotty Ash, Liverpool) is a veteran English comedian and singer, famous for selling over 100 million records, his buck teeth, frizzy hair, feather duster (or \"tickling stick\"), and his catchphrases, often playing on the 'tickled' motif, e.g. \"How tickled I am!\".Dodd is the last of the music hall comics, and is well regarded by his comedy peers. In a 2005 poll of comedians and comedy insiders to find The Comedian's Comedian, he was voted amongst the 'Top 50 Comedy Acts Ever', ranked as number 36. Dodd is also famed for his meticulous recording of every performance, cross-referencing the place he was performing, the jokes he has used, and the reception they received, so as to hone his act to near-perfection for each audience.",
