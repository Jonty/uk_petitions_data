The CSA say this is fair. So the 1 child with the pwc gets \u00a350 a week plus \u00a354 arrears which the CSA have created themselfs with the corrupt ways they go about their business. End all the misery and suffering caused under csa1 rules which are made up everyday and altered to suit the csa. They are corrupt and are pulling money in from existing csa1 cases to make the figures look good for them to get their bonuses and help the government look good. Help all the poor kids living in poverty under CSA1 rules.",
