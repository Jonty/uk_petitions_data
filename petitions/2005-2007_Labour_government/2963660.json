        "background": "Council housing embodies socialist ideals. Before it the poor were forced to rent in the open market where rents were barely affordable and conditions were often unsanitary (The Gorbals Tenements or Rachmanism'). \nSocial housing ended this with clean modern housing at secured affordable rents.\nNow this 'socialist' government is considering ending these rights - something no other party has ever seen as anything other than political suicide! \nIf permitted future governments would have carte blanche to make any changes they see fit. Our older and less able relatives and friends could find themselves facing eviction at short notice and searching for accommodation in an expensive and saturated market. Even where social security benefits are available they rarely cover to the same extent as they do for a council house. To the government these are just houses to the tenants they are their homes and often have been for the majority of their lives.",
