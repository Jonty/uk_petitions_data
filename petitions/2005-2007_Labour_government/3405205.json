There is frequenetly a 'grey' arae in which decisions have to be made based on the current situation, environment etc. Much like we have an amber light interposed between green and red and a red/amber light between red and green.\n\nThe continentals have a different philosphy and culture - let them keep there but they must allow us to also keep ours.\nTo change would involve billions of unnecessary expense in reveiwing and changing of legislation and also in re 'educating' us. All at absolutely no benefite to health or safety perfomance in this country. We have a higher safety perfomance in this country let us do nothing to reduce it or simply placate the EC",
