            "background": "Reduce the nuclear missile (built and designed in Britain) fleet to 2 submarines (built and designed in Britain) which can carry only 10 nuclear weapons each. With the money saved, we want to invest in 4 new top-of-the-range aircraft carriers,(one built in the US for quality and cheapness) as opposed to the current 2 proposed aircraft carriers. We also want the nuclear powered submarine fleet increased to 25. In addition we want the MOD to train an additional 50,000 troops, a further 9000 top-of-the-range tanks built and the Royal navy to have all vessels over 30 years old to be scrapped and replaced with superior vessels, Penultimatly we want the airforce to have 1000 fighter planes built and 500 bombers built. Lastly we want all planes, vessels and military machines to be equipped with the latest safety equipment to stop needless deaths of our own troops.",
