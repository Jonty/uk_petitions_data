            "background": "Currently certain MPs are asking for a 60% salary increase.  This is ridiculous in the light of recent pensions and allowances increases.  There seems to be no control over the direct spending of Parliament.  \n\nParliament should have a fixed budget that increases in line with inflation.  Should this prove inadequate budget changes should require primary legislation, or some other visible and transparent mechanism, to ensure that proper scrutiny of any changes occurs.  \n\nIf MPs wanted more cash OK.  They would simply have to decide to reduce pensions, allowances, heating bills, support staff, etc to compensate.  Right now there seems to be no control and MPs can simply have what they want.  They need to be constrained in order to set a good example to the rest of the public sector who have either to keep to published budgets or face public opprobrium.",
