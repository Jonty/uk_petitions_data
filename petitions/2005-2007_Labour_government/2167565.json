I want to run a petition from today til 12 Feb 2008, to demand that the government spend no more of the tax payers money protecting these murderers.  They have had the benefit of paid accomodation, paid for education, and government workers at their beckon call. I do not expect the Govt to give up their names but they have had so many advantages that i feel it is now time for them to stand on their own. Little James got no justice whatsoever.  If you feel as strongly about this as i do, please sign this petition.",
