        "background": "I propose that this government should stop using stealth taxes, fines and charges to stop bad behaviour. i.e. stop ripping the general public off through the use congestion charges, road tax, speeding fines, petrol taxes, ticket pricing for public transport, cigarette duty, alcohol duty and the myriad of other financial instruments to limit behaviour.  \n\nPeople should be stimulated by positive action not continually stung by financial threats.\n\nLegislation, education, advertising, tax breaks, investment in transportation alternatives and a myriad of other more creative policy tools that I haven't thought of should be used to influence the British people into improving how we act to each other, become more environmentally friendly, calm traffic etc.\n\nMake Britain a better place, not just a more expensive one!",
