            "background": "Currently some consumer electronics (for example washing machines) are sold with efficiency ratings. But the majority of household goods are subject mainly to safety regulations only. By creating a set of permissible guidelines for efficiency for a range of goods starting at some set point in the future - manufacturers will have a clear target at which to aim for. This might be in the form of maximum standby current, or maximum power consumption for each category. High power consumption items (such as incandescent light bulbs) where more efficient alternatives are already available should be banned altogether. The aim of this is to lower the average household energy consumption; the advantages of this are obvious.",
