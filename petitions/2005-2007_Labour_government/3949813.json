Instead of being short-termistwe need tolook to the future, ifwe fail to look after them theproblem will onlyget worse. Currently theHomeless cost 1bn a year,we should invest more,an invest in compulsiary rehab,Aopposed toShort-term solutions. By doing so we will save numerous lives, in addition to this we will save the taxpayer money on the longrun, along with helping our society. We should createNHSclinics, in the model of ones such as the PriorClinic inKent, where homeless&addicts are put into intensive courses (at a private cost of 4000pounds aweek), such courses rely on well to do parents/family being able to pay. Such treatment should be free.TheNHSshould provide forthese people, freeof charge.",
