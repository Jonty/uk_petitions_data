        "action": "Revise current policy regarding criminal punishment such that all offences that do not necessitate imprisonment, such as nonviolent and nonsexual offences, are punished with long hours of useful community service that would firstly be of benefit to the local community and secondly relate, if possible and applicable, to the original offence.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Prison is widely seen by criminals as a soft punishment, a view shared by many law abiding citizens.  Presently, security is lax, drugs are rife and many criminals see a prison history as a source of kudos.  It is believed, however, that those criminals whose crimes do not necessitate social exclusion by imprisonment should be punished by more effective means - community work designed to be of use to the public but also to publicly shame the individuals.  This would avoid unnecesary further corruption of minor criminal by hardened crininals whilst in the prison system and would also free up many,much needed, resources.",
