            "background": "Prison is widely seen by criminals as a soft punishment, a view shared by many law abiding citizens.  Presently, security is lax, drugs are rife and many criminals see a prison history as a source of kudos.  It is believed, however, that those criminals whose crimes do not necessitate social exclusion by imprisonment should be punished by more effective means - community work designed to be of use to the public but also to publicly shame the individuals.  This would avoid unnecesary further corruption of minor criminal by hardened crininals whilst in the prison system and would also free up many,much needed, resources.",
