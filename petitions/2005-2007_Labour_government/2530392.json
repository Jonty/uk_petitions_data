        "background": "I object to the introduction of the unpopular yet inevitable UK ID card scheme. However, this promised \"secure\" scheme should allow online voting through a secure internet connection. Should the majority of the UK, ID card-holding electorate sign an e-Petition it shall be introduced as law or be adopted as policy. Repeatedly this government has chosen to ignore the will of its people who they represent and serve. The people of the UK deserve  a reactive government that is in accord with the electorate.",
