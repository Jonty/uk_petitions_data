            "background": "For many years christian childrens charities have helped to find kids good homes. Some of these charities are to be forced to close because of new legislation which would if they continue force them to give kids to gay people for adoption, which is at odds with the beliefs of the charities. In our view the rights of the children who are supported by these charities are more important that the rights of gay people to adopt from these particular charities, when there will be many other agencies more than willing to help them to adopt. These charities should be allowed to continue to live by there beliefs and therefore to remain open.",
