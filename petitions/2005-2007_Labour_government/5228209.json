            "background": "Without wanting to minimise the devastation Kate and Gerry McCann obviously feel at Madeleine's disappearance I find it difficult to understand why only HER disappearance is treated as so important.  The parents of ALL children who are missing, or have disappeared, suffer in the same way; how many children have disappeared since Madeleine and how must their parents feel about the concentration on her.  ALL children are equally important; my fear is that if Madeleine is found (as of course I hope she is) the resources devoted to the search for her will mean another child, or several children, will fail to be found.",
