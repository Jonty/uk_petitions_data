        "background": "While recycling facilites are available at many supermarkets, they are usually provided by local councils not the supermarkets themselves. I propose all supermarkets provide full recycling facilites, especially for plastic, and to fund such facilites out of their vast profits. Perhaps when they have to pay for the disposal of all the plastic waste they create, they will then reduce the amount of packaging.",
