In my Sunday magazine I read of a couple expecting their SEVENTEENTH child and they STILL want more.  Every child born is a new person who will use up his/her share of the world's finite resources; if the Government is really serious about combatting climate change it will bring in laws to limit the number of biological children any one couple can have; if they want more they should adopt.  If laws can be brought in banning abortion after a certain period in the pregnancy - which could be seen as interferance in people's private affairs - why not this too?",
