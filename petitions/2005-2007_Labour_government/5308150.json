            "background": "There is much in the news at the moment about lowering the drink-drive limit to 50mg, which somehow will magically stop people drink-driving.\n\nThere are also many suggestions (on e-petitions on here) to cut it all the way to 0mg, as this will apparently make the limit clearer to understand. What with many meals, mouthwash, desserts and chocolates that contain alcohol, and the fact that small traces of alcohol can remain detectable in the bloodstream for a very long and unpredictable amount of time (varies based on many factors), many people will almost always have some trace in their blood.\n\nThis will therefore confuse people more as to when it's safe to drive compared to a set nominal limit.",
