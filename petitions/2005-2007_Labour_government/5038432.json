What is there to hide? Many MP's have  made the point that the Data Protection Act provides the protection that Mr Maclean claims is needed.\nThis act makes us no better than those countries which we are fond of characterising as lesser societies, because they have not learned to share power. We should not call ourselves 'democratic' while we tolerate behaviour such as this.",
