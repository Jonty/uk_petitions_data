            "background": "Many of the stresses and problems we face are caused by the simple fact that there are too many people - traffic congestion and gridlock, pollution, unaffordable housing, climate change and global warming, loss of habitat for wildlife leading to mass extinction of species on an unprecedented scale.  In addition to encouraging more sustainable lifestyles for each one of us, the international community and also religious leaders need to encourage people in both the developed and developing world to seriously lower the birth rate, so that the global population does not increase further to 9 billion by 2050 - but actually reduces to a much more sustainable level or even a significant reduction below the present 6 billion.",
