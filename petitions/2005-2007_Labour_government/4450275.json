            "background": "Most bartenders appear to take the view that customers should accept less beer than they have paid for.  If this were not the case, they would fill pint and half pint to brim glasses to the brim, not anything up to 20mm less.  Alternatively they would use lined glasses.  This topic has been raised in the past and always the publicans and brewers object.  In this day and age it is high time we encouraged a culture of being provided with what we pay for.  Why should spirits drinkers have greater protection than beer drinkers?  The drinks industry says that customers are free to ask for the glass to be \u201ctopped up\u201d.  I maintain that this is a cynical ploy, as I for one have never seen anyone ask for a top-up.  (I do ask, and am often insulted or made to feel bad for asking). Further it is often impracticable (in a busy Pub), and messy, to have ones glass properly filled.",
