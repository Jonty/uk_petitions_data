            "background": "Supermarkets are destroying the free market in the UK, and limiting consumer choice. Action must be taken (by Government, by the Monopolies Commission) to ensure that smaller traders are given a fair opportunity to compete. No supermarket should have more than 20% of the market of any goods within a range of 25 miles of their business. Those that have more than this should be forced to close (with any proceeds being fed back into the local community). There must be tighter regulation of supermarkets and action taken against any form of bribe to obtain permission to build a supermarket (including pseudo-bribes such as building a road or a library).",
