            "background": "Darwinian Theory, as has been taught in schools for decades, is generally accepted as fact.  To be fair, we ask the Prime Minister to make it mandatory that Intelligent Design be taught as an equally plausible hypothesis.  Evolution is taught on the basis of the religion (atheist), so Christians and others should be allowed to have their beliefs supported.  And there IS scientifically valid evidence for ID, just as there appears to be for Evolution. \nIf this country bans one religion's belief on how we came to be, we should abandon all religious beliefs - even atheist beliefs (evolution) and therefore, have no basis to question our existence- just accept it and move on.  Thus putting and end to \"science.\"  This is not recommended, however.",
