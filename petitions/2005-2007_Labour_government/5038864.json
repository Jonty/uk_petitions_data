        "background": "All local authorities are currently obliged to provide a service for dealing with stray dogs. However. the service councils provide are usually 9-5, Mon-Fri, and outside these hours, the public are expected to take animals to the police - often not something which is possible; especially with agressive animals (and why should this responsibility fall on the police in any case?). We need a 24-hour service, 7 days-a-week; who will collect stray dogs in a trained, professional manner.",
