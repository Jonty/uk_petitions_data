            "background": "It is absolutely deplorable that our international footballers are paid to play for England, particularly in the current climate whereby their performances have been shambolic.\n\nThe underlying point is that they should not be paid to represent our country in the first place, this should be an HONOUR, not a task which requires remuneration, however the fact that they are representing our country and producing below par (at best) performances makes it all the worse.\n\nIn addition, I believe the FA should consider withdrawing all financial bonuses, particularly for major competitions such as the World Cup/European Championships. If the players object, let them explain to us why they need to be paid for playing for their country. I'd be delighted to hear their answers.",
