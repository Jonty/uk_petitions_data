Probation Officers rely on the honest of their Clients, which is patently unreal, because the same Clients only were required to be supervised by the Probation Service because had either acted dishonestly and/or lied to the Courts to avoid punishment. The Probation Service is a waste of the Public's money and Dr Reid should declare it unfit for purpose.",
