Therefore, using Energy saving bulbs would mean a reduction of around 8-12% in household energy consumprion.\n\nEnergy saving light bulbs have a number of advantages over traditional light bulbs, most importantly using 80% less power consumption than traditional light bulbs and having a 10 year life span. \n\nTo encourage more people to use energy saving bulbs, normal bulbs should be taxed in order than they are at least the same price as an energy saving bulb.",
