            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is  important that the UK reduces it's carbon emissions as quickly as possible. In many areas this will not be easy or quick and will require long term investment, for instance in new power stations.\n\nRoad transport is one of the biggest users of fuel. It has been estimated that if speed limits were observed we would reduce overall fuel consumption by about half a million tons of carbon (about 12% of the total CO2 from road transport). This would go a long way towards the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nTo make this reduction fair and effective, current speed limits would need to be observed and possibly lowered. \n\nGlobal warming is one of the biggest threats to our safety and way of life. The Prime Minister has said, speaking recently in New Zealand, \u201cI think in terms of the long term future there is no issue that is more important than climate change.\u201d and \u201call the latest signs indicate that the problem is not getting better, it is getting worse and more rapidly.\u201d",
