        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Hotels are graded with a \" * \" rating e.g 1* being lowest and 5* being the highest. i would like a similar thing where student houses are concerned.\nletting agencies vet the houses \"thouroughly\". it is extremly common to view houses with rot, damp and even rat droppings. i feel that if a sliding scale is introduced students will be able to clearly make the right choice.\n students get ripped off in the housing market, putting down big deposits and also paying summer retainers to keep a property. i want to halt summer retainers (where students pay for their property over the summer, even though they dont live there), have a tighter set of rules regarding standard of living and to raise awareness of the squalor we are expected to live in.\nfor many, if not most, it is extremly difficult to come up with a full months deposit, half-rent summer retainer and then your initial rent. you are looking at nealy \u00a31000  before you have even moved in.\nif this legistlation comes into place, i feel landlords/letting agencies will improve the standard of their housing, making student homes pleasant, clean, learning envirionments.",
