I demand to make it a 'Optional' national holiday. Drugs should be legalised for a 14 day period, 7 days either side of the 25th May.  Pubs/bars/clubs should serve complimentary cocktails, and girls on rollerskates dish out bugle on big silver trays during this period.\n\nThe Queen, and Kate Middelton must also visit me for breakfast on the morning of the 25th, annually.",
