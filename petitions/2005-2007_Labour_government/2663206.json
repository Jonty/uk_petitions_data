Numerous studies have demonstrated that full-time mothers are always the best for the child and the family, and yet maternity leave only lasts a few weeks.\n\nAt the moment, unless a mother happens to be single or have a husband with a substantial income, she must return to work after the end of her maternity period.\n\nFor this reason, we call upon the government must provide appropriate financial support for mothers who wish to do so to look after their children properly until they reach school age.",
