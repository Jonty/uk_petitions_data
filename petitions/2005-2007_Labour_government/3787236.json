            "background": "The plug was pulled on Liverpools, tram scheme, Manchesters tram extension and Sheffields tram scheme, coincidentally at the time the government announced it was going to re develop the only run down part of London behind the guise of the Olympics. Manchesters decision was dramatically overturned a few months later, but why dont the government overturn the Liverpool decision as well. Liverpool is, after all, 2008 capital of culture why not give the city back a piece of its heritage.",
