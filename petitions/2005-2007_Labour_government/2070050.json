            "background": "The cause of congestion on UK roads is the failed policy of traffic calming which was introduced in the early 1990's.\n\nIt is plain to see that if all major trunk roads in and out of city centers are reduced to one lane then this is going to cause congestion.\n\nIt was clear to me in the 1990's when traffic calming was introduced it was a long term strategy to create congestion then charge motorist as another stealth tax.\n\nIf all major truck roads were reopened to two lanes a lot of congestion would disappear.\n\nEnd traffic calming now to ease congestion and stop congestion charges.",
