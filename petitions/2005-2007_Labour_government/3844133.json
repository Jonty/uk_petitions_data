            "background": "At a time when the Prime Minister is apologising for the slave trade we think it appropriate that on this 90th anniversary of Lord Balfour's historic letter to the Zionist Federation, he apologise to the Palestinian people for the suffering caused to them by Balfour.  Britain's policy of allowing massive Jewish immigration into Palestine increased the proportion of Jews in Palestine from 8% of the population in 1917 to 30% in 1948. This was sufficient for them to seize 78% of Palestine by force and create the state of Israel. The war that this caused and the wars that followed have created almost 6 million Palestinian refugees, 4 million of whom live in refugee camps.  Approximately 3 million Palestinians live under Israeli occupation or siege in East Jerusalem, the West Bank and Gaza.",
