            "background": "The Human Rights Act - a serious and worthy piece of legislation. \n\nHowever, like most British people I believe it is being abused. People are using it to defend their 'preferences' for life styles. It is being used by criminals and crooks to frustrate the rule of law. Religions are using it to redefine what is permitted, and not permitted in this country.\nRedraw or redefine the Act. Tell Europe it was envisaged to protect people from the horrors of torture and such events. It was not designed to be used by, for example, inmates in prison to demand pornography or by asylum seekers to defend their life-styles.\nWe the undersigned believe Enough is enough. Change this legislation.",
