        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Dixie Dean is without argument, the greatest striker that these shores, never mind the world, has ever produced. He scored 383 goals in 433 appearances for Everton Football Club, he is the only footballer in the world to score 60 league goals in one season, a feat that will NEVER be broken. This just 2 years after a motorbike accident left him for dead. He also was never booked or sent off in his playing career. His scoring feats will never be matched by anyone. Even Bill Shankly was moved to state that his stature and legend was comparable to the likes of Beethoven, Shakespheare and Mozart. He is simply the greatest sportsman this country has ever produced and should be likewise remembered. A kighthood is one of few awards that can seen as apt to the great man and in an age where we are all to quick to declare our mediocre sportsmen legends, it is about time the greatest of them all was given his due reward.",
