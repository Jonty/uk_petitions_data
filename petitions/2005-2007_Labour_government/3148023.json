        "background": "Mortgage lenders who are willing to lend 7 (seven) or more times an individual's or a couple's salary over, increasingly, 25, 30 and even up to 50 years are responsible for the spiralling cost of house purchasing in the UK. Capping both loan amounts and length of loan repayments, together, will, necessarily, slow house price rises and will give future generations a chance of home ownership.",
