As of last year though when one Chicken,sheep or any animal dies on a farm, as occurs in any population naturally, a man drives 60 miles to collect it then 100 miles to a crematorium for animals where using Gas the animal is incinerated, so for a chicken worth \u00a33.60 in Sainsbury we burn over 100 miles of petrol, burn the gas for incineration and transport a dead animal miles from the place of death with all the associated bio security risks, as well as all the energy used to print numerous forms to be completed and trasported read and filed. If this government is serious about green issues then it will act quickly to repeal this senseless law.",
