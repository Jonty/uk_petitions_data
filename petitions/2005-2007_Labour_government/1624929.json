            "background": "We now live in the 21st century and not everyone believes in a form of god anymore. Even those who do can see the problems that dogmatic devotion to religion can bring. The government is meant to represent the views of the whole population based on citizenship and residence, not based on religion.\n\nWe call on the PM to legally seperate \"church\" and \"state\" to the point that the state does not fund any religious activity whatsoever and that there is no reference to religion found in any public building, law, regulation or institution and that any such references currently in place be removed. \n\nWe call on the PM to do this in such a way that people will know that this is about expanding human rights, not curtailing them. The USA and France are good examples of how this can be done in modern soctiety.\n\nWe recognize the value of religion but believe that it should have no interaction with government and government should have no interaction with it, save when/if it breaks the law.",
