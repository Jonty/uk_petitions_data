            "background": "Like many western European countries, Britain is suffering from low birth rates.  More and more professional are being encouraged to pursue a career and leave having children too late.  That means some opf the cream of our genetic crop are being removed from the gene pool.  Of course women should not be compelled to wear clothes that they are not comfortable with, but I think many otherwise attractive women are wearing tights which are simply a turn off to men.  If the wearing of stockings was encouraged, I think men woudl be happier to atart relationships with them, and therefore probably have babies earlier.",
