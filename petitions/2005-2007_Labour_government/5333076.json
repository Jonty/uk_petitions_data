            "background": "If prisoners are released early because of lack of space in prisons then what sort of message are we sending to criminals?\n\nWe are basically telling them it is ok to commit an offence - if they don't feel like behaving appropriately in society they don't have to because our prisons are full anyway.\n\nWe already live in what is fast becoming a lawless society. Children are disciplined less and less in school and have no fear of the law as they know police have fewer powers to charge them than ever before.\n\nDiscipline needs to start in school and children need to be taught respect for themselves and for others. We live in a world gone mad with political correctness.\n\nIF PEOPLE ARE AFRAID OF CONSEQUENCES THEN MANY WILL NOT COMMIT THE CRIME - YOU WILL CERTAINLY NEVER REDUCE CRIME BY TAKING AWAY THE CONSEQUENCES.",
