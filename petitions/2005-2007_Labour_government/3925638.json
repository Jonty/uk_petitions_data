            "action": "instigate a Royal Commission to investigate fully the practice and ethics of animal experiments and how modern cruelty-free methods can eventually replace entirely all such experimentation and testing.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Within the vivisection industry  continued secrecy from public investigation is welcomed.In the interests of true science citizens must have access to full details of experiments.  The public clearly have a conscience in these matters, and the industry is worried that if an independent investigation makes public both the cruelty (without anaesethics)and wasted resources in this unscientific and out of date method of research, that the public will clamour for more effort and resources to be put into the sourcing of humane alternatives.  Real research into human health and less reliance on imaginary \"magic bullets\" to cure \"diseases\" will be demanded by intelligent and humane people, who realise that we cannot continue this endless search for ways to enable us to live unhealthily without the consequences.",
