            "background": "If this was done then it would increase the chance of being able to eradicate the unclean nuclear power source altogether, so removing many problems in one go.  And even if the research fails to come up with anything, it's got to be better than paying \u00a320 billion to increase the amount of nuclear waste in our country. Also, if we get nuclear defence, we are encouraging other countries to do so, creating further pollution- therefore it is in everyone's interest to prevent this from happening.",
