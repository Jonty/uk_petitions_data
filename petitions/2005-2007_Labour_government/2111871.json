        "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\nWhile we already enjoy the gratefully accepted winter fuel payment,would it be too much to ask you to favourably consider granting senior citizens a monthly allowance of cheaper fuel,say twenty pence a litre in the form of vouchers.\nThe vouchers could bear the necessary information relating to the entitled vehicle owner on presentation of the drivers'photocard licence and / or other documenation.\nOne monthly fill would enable us to visit our families without having to worry about the high cost at present levels.\nThank you.\nDennis Reynolds.",
