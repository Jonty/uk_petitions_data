This question has gone round and round in my mind since  I witnessed a protest in London about children and how as a nation we are letting them down.  In time the results of this gross betrayal of our youngsters will be all too evident, but too late!  The need for change from some of the traditional methods of dealing with youngsters was obvious, but values such as manners, social etiquette and respectful discipline, which have all been undermined in some way by liberalists, need to be reintroduced if we are to change the moral abyss that permeates our society at the moment.",
