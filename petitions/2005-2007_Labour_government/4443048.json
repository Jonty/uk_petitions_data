        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Basing Council Tax on house values is extremely unfair as householders have no way of controlling their house values.  Also, Council Tax is to pay for services provided and house values have nothing to do with the services used.  If there is a family of four working adults in a house, they should pay more than a couple in the same kind of house, as the family uses more of the services provided - they would create more waste and use more of the council services. The Council already know the details of people living in a house from the electoral register so it would be simple to apply. And those already claiming benefits would get help with paying the tax.",
