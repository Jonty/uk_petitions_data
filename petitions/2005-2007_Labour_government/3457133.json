Watson Wyatt actuaries in 2005, found that anyone working in the private sector would have to accumulate a \u00a31,290,000 pension fund in order to get the same index-linked income for life that a MP can get after less than 27 years of work. A private sector worker would need to save \u00a330,000 p.a. to have the same benefits.",
