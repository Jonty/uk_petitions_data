            "background": "Outstanding entertainer, Engelbert Humperdinck, who turned 71 today, May 2nd, is long overdue for a Queen's Honour.  Several of us have submitted paperwork to the Ceremonial Secretariat's office nearly two years ago. Recently referring to your updated criteria checklist for nomination, dated the 30th of April 2007, Engelbert surpasses the requirements.  Please be reminded of all the accolades he has added to his original submission and also the fact that the University of Leicester has honoured him the the Doctorate of Music Degree, proudly naming him Dr. Engelbert Humperdinck, \"Son of Leicester\".  Please have the Arts and Media Department review his papers and escalate his nomination soon.  Thank you.",
