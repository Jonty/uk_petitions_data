            "background": "Pensioners deserve decent Pay. The wages of the pensioners are just too poor in the UK and needs to be reviewed. At least every pensioner should be allowed to receive every month, three quarters of their last monthly pay. This will help prevent and eradicate poorverty in the elderly, and make everybody happy in the UK,  and it will be in the history of our Prime Minister, who is one of the best Prime Minister in the world. Labour Government will always be on top. We have all worked hard, let us enjoy our old age, not suffering.   Sincerely,Rebecca.",
