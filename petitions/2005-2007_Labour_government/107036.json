        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Please ban all thermal power plants, regardless of what they are fired with. Burning coal and gas causes acid rains as sulphur is emitted to the atmosphere, and burning oil causes smog.\nAcid rains and smog can be deadly and are deadlier threats to British citizens than bird flu.\nThese power stations are also wasteful: they burn much fuel everyday and generate not much power. Every hour, a coal-fired TPP burns a mountain of coal that weights 200 tons. And that's just about one hour. That's a waste of coal. Oil-fired TPPs are not better, because they waste 50% of oil.\nAnd those aren't the only problems TPPs cause. They also make us dependent on fossil fuel suppliers. We import 75% of the coal we burn, most of that from Russia and Colombia - unreliable suppliers. \nPlease licence American third generation nuclear reactors so that nuclear power plants meet 80% of our electricity demand, just like the French do. The French decided to do this a long time ago, and they were right.",
