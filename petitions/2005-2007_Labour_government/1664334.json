            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "McClaren took over as England manager on 1 August 2006.  Most England fans criticized the selection of McClaren as manager. McClaren then dropped Beckham from the squad citing amongst other reasons his age. Despite this he still continues to play the equally old Gary Neville. The first few games of each new national manager\u2019s career should be discounted due to players believing this is a new start. So then England beat Macedonia 1-0, not impressive. Then England drew 0-0 in the return game, not impressive. Then England lost 2-0 to Croatia, very poor. After the first game of 2007 England lost 0-1 to Spain and manager and team were booed off the pitch at the final whistle. England soon return to the Wembley to start winning at the Home of English football.  Do we really want this manager to take us into the first game at Wembley? Please sign this so England can return to the glory days, when England played attractive football and win or lose it could be something we were proud of.",
