            "background": "The original marathon distance in ancient Greece is believed to have been 40 kilometres and this was the distance used in the first modern Olympics in 1896. The distance was extended in the 1908 Olympics in London simply so that the race would finish where the Royal family were viewing it. Since 1924 this unconventional distance (26 miles 385 yards) has become the offical distance of the marathon. I urge the government to press the International Olympic Committee to restore the marathon to it's original distance, hopefully in time for the London Olympics on 2012.",
