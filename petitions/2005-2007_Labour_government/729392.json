        "background": "I am in the under 25 age group an receive a low wage as i only work part time, however, when I looked up the Tax Credits website I found that someone in my age group can only get help with expenses if they have kids whereas if I was over 25 I wouldnt need to. This is just one of many factors which encourages young girls to have kids they cant look after. It feels like I'm being punished for being sensible.",
