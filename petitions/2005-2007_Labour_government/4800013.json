            "background": "In February 1993 a young boy of 3, Jamie Bulger, was taken from a Liverpool shopping centre by two 10-year-old boys. These two boys, even being boys, understood what they did to Jamie was wrong, hence trying to make his horrific injuries look like an accident. Lady Justice Butler-Sloss has awarded the two boys anonymity for the rest of their lives when they leave custody with new identities. They will also leave custody early only serving just over half of their sentence. They are being relocated to Australia to live out the rest of their lives. They disgustingly and violently took Jamie's life away and in return they each get a new life.\nThis is a grave miscarriage of justice and must be reviewed.",
