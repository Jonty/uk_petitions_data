            "background": "My family like most young working class families in Britain live on a tight budget.  When in the supermarket shopping my concern is more about how much we have spent rather than how healthy the food is in my shopping trolley.  We like many families simply cannot afford to purchase fresh ingredients, fruit etc.  This is unacceptable and is directly leading to obese children in Britain.  I have heard a suggestion that thoughts have been given to increasing the price of less healthy foods, this would simply send young families further into debt without addressing the health problems we face.  I call on the prime minister to REDUCE the cost of healthy food now to prevent huge problems in the future.",
