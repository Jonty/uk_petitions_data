            "background": "By fitting speed governors to a maximum of 70 mph there will be significant reductions in vehicle CO2 emissions, which rise significantly in relation to increasing speed and fuel inefficiency. There will also be other benefits such as increased road capacity, reduced accidents etc. There could be an incentive through road tax for installing these voluntarily. This will be simple to introduce and cause clear benefits applying to all equally.",
