            "background": "I feel VAT is being done to much and instead of 17.5% we are paying 35% or more due to cost of VAT at Manufacturer such as beer(Real Ale), which has duty plus VAT at production and a further 17.5% at customer level for example a pint of real ale costs \u00a32.90p to the customer and with double VAT, deduct vAT at manufacter and purchase it would cost \u00a31.60p and sell more.\nI suggest vAT be set at 5% across the board which cause an econmic growth in British industry, and make good s cheaper than imports and hom eproduced items done by microbreweries and major brewers, therefore keeping the pub trade alive with current smoking ban which will close many pubs.",
