            "background": "The ema system favours those of lower incomes, but gives no recognition to those families who have higher incomes. This does not mean that the student has any wealth at all to buy books or educational materials!! \n\nThe ema system provides the benefitting student with no incentive for WORK or bettering themselves with work while studying to earn a little money, surely something the government should be championing . It is counter-productive to introduce poeple to state benefits at such a young age, this will lead to benefit dependancy in later life. Why can't people work these days and not rely on the state! SCRAP THIS UNFAIR SYSTEM AND WASTE OF GOVERNMENT MONEY. \n\nIn manys ways the highest users of tobacco and drugs are the poor so does this not just worsen the problem of SUBSTANCE misue etc??\nFIGHT FOR EQUAL RIGHTS, SCRAP EMA, NOW!!!!!!",
