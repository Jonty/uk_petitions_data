            "background": "The Federation of Companion Animal Societies promotes responsible pet keeping/companion animal ownership.  Please help to ensure that under the Animal Welfare Act the interests of pet keepers are acknowledged & the legislation is not derailed by the Animal Rights lobby.\n\nCompanion animals are good for people. Research has consistently shown the benefits to children; lessons about life, reproduction, death & bereavement & developing respect & responsibility for all living things. For the elderly, pets provide companionship, sense of purpose, routine & help prevent loneliness and depression.\n\nResearch also shows keeping a pet lowers the risk of heart disease & reduces use of the family doctor. The benefit of pet keeping is estimated to save the NHS a billion pounds annually.\n\nHalf the homes in the UK currently own a pet & the pet industry is valued at \u00a33.5 billion annually.  Britain is a nation of animal lovers; please help to ensure that it can remain a nation that loves to keep pets.",
