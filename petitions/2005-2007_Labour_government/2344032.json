        "background": "First time buyers have been priced out of the market to such an extent that anyone who is a first time buyer, even on an above national average earnings level is in an adverse financial position in terms of monthly living costs as a result of the high mortgage payments as a result of the squirrelling of properties by those established in the property market renting houses out at above mortgage rate levels simply because mortgages are so inaccessible. The rental income generated is rarely declared by the homeowners, and the equity is an even rarer subject of taxation, yet those who fail to profit - the first time and low chain buyers - are increasingly taxed through, amongst other schemes, stamp duty. If these renters were required to register as companies, accounts would be required and established taxation rates would be necessary, therefore discouraging many propertly prospectors.",
