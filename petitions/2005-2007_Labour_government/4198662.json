            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The increase in house values alone is bringing many more people into the inheritance tax bracket. While their property may be valuable they often do not have the funds available to pay the inheritance tax. This can lead to people having to sell the family home just to pay the tax and is grossly unfair.\nThe reason for the upper limit of one million pounds is so that the more wealthy, who may well have the money to pay the tax, do not benefit from this relaxation. Also only excluding the Principle Private Residence would mean that estates with more than one property would still have their additional residences included in the calculation of inheritance tax.",
