        "action": "abolish child support payments for fathers who wanted an abortion, but had no say in the mothers decision",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is incredibly unfair that the father of a child should have to pay child support when they had no say at all whether or not to keep the baby. The mother has complete control over this, and should therefore have to take responsibility for funding, and bringing up the child if the father wants an abortion.  Both are responsible for creating the baby, and therefore both should have a say whether to keep it.  If the mother wants to keep the baby, the father should then have to sign something stating whether or not he agrees.  If he doesn't agree, then he also dismisses any visitation rights with the child, which is only fair if he's not paying anything.  We're supposed to be a country of equal rights, and i think the way this issue is currently being dealt with is an absolute joke.",
