            "background": "Last year the Chancellor, Mr Gordon Brown, attended the 110th Birthday of Mr Henry Allingham, the UK's oldest man and one of the last surviving\nsoldiers in the UK who served in World War One.\n\nMr Allingham, when he is able, still visits schools and colleges to talk to children of his experiences in the war, and apart from his two WWI medals, he has also been further honoured by the French for his services.\n\nI think it would be most fitting in the days of over paid cricketers and footballers being given awards, that we could perhaps make a special award to a true hero of our nation, before it's too late !!",
