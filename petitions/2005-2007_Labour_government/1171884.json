            "background": "There are far to many Immigrants arriving in the UK from the stated areas. These are only the immigrants we know about! They are on the council housing priority list , able to claim benefits at free will ( Including for their children back home ) , Drive vehicles without Insurance , licence , MOT etc...\nUK citizens are getting a raw deal with immigration! The Government is sweeping the problem under the carpet. The Labour party has failed its citizens. Help get the unemployed UK citizens back to work first via Training/ Job Hunting. There is no need to have so many arriving from Eastern Europe , they are taking jobs from UK citizens. It is happening far to often , And I know that what the Government sais about \" We need them to fill the jobs that no-one else wants to do\" is nonsense. Since when do UK citizens hate being Builders? Or working in factories? Is a 100% Farce! Immigration must be stopped now! For the sake of the nations future!",
