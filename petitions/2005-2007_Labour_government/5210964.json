            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Whilst we are all aware that not 100% of any fan base in this country are complete saints, I feel it is in the best interests of English football as a whole that UEFA, and in particular William Galliard apologise for their slanderous allegations made in the past week. I fear that if this kind of unprofessional propaganda is allowed to continue it will eventually affect all English clubs participating in European competition. It is worrying that not just Liverpool, but Manchester United and also Tottenham Hotspur have been victims of what seems to be a prevalent and alleged Anglophobic agenda that UEFA and certain national police forces are currently adhereing to. \n\nI cannot see how the worlds second biggest footballing organisation cannot instigate some standard guidelines on how to organise away fans, regardless of nationality, during the earlier rounds without the use of potential heavy handedness and intimidation.\n\nI ask the government, particularly the sports minister Richard Caborn to pressure UEFA to review their policies on stadium selection and ticket allocation for future showpiece finals and to remove from their agenda their seemingly anti-English viewpoint.",
