            "background": "Helen House and Francis House have been in the media recently. They and all the other children's hospices around Britain provide help and support to families with children whose life expectancy is short. The amount of official money via NHS referrals is very small and most of their running costs is met by fund-raising. Where medical science can now prolong the life of a sick child who 100 years ago, say, would have died in infancy, the need for care, friendship, love, emotional support, training, respite breaks, bereavement counselling etc will never diminish, but will grow until such time as we can cure all childhood illnesses.",
