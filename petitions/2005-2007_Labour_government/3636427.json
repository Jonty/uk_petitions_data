Britain will lose its identity and will have no power to veto decisions made by a reformed European Parliament.  Once the Declaration on the Future of Europe is signed, there will be no turning back and no room for renegotiation on any European treaties.  Let Britain remain as Britain.  Listen to the people.  We do not want to be ruled by Europe.  We have done very well, for hundreds of years, on our own.  Please, Mr Blair, don't leave us this way.  The least Mr Blair could do is put this forward for Public Referendum.  Let the people decide.",
