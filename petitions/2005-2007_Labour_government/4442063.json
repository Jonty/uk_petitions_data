            "background": "National Environment Technology Centre data shows that an average diesel engined bus emits as much particulate pollution as 128 cars, and as much oxides of nitrogen (NOx) as 39 cars. Is there any bus on the roads -including the planned 45 ft non-articulated monster buses - that will regularly carry 129 car drivers?\n\nThe University of Tokyo has found the chemical 3-nitrobenzanthrone in diesel bus exhausts when the engine is under load, e.g. when pulling away from a High Street bus stop. At the time of its identification this chemical was, and probably still is, one of the most carcinogenic chemicals known to science.\n\nAutomotive Advisers and Associates, Hilden, Germany, studied the sustainability of public transport versus private transport, and concluded that that buses and their public transport alternatives consume 60% more energy than cars per person transported, and take up 200% more public space.",
