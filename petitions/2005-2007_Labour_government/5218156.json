To create an atmosphere to match the wonderful Wembley Stadium, I am asking on you the Prime Minister to help and support the idea for \"singing only\" section/s. \n\nThere is no better feeling for an England Fan to support their team with people who share the same mindset. Feeling as though you are spoiling the experience for those who wish to sit, watch, and take in the whole experience can be very off putting. The stewards are constantly moving within the crowd to stop confrontations, the ability to \"get the atmosphere\" going is difficult - and as such the ability to become the 12th man is very difficult.\n\nSo I ask for your support in opening a dialogue with the F.A. and Wembley Stadium Limited and ask that a \"singing section\" be considered for future Internationals that England play in. The benefits are huge to the supporters, the team, the atmosphere...I could go on.",
