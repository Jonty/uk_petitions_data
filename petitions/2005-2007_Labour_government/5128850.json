            "background": "The Oxford English Dictionary is widely regarded as the definitive work on the English language, attempting to catalogue every English word, and still ongoing in its quest to this day.  Unfortunately, the complete dictionary is large and cumbersome, so most people have to make do with heavily abridged versions.  Several dictionaries are available for free on the internet, but those are barely more complete than the abridged paper versions that can be found in most homes.  Complete dictionaries can still be found in libraries, but many are underfunded and inconvenient for everyday use.  Making the complete OED available online would instantly make the full richness of the English language available to far more people than currently have access to it.  It would also have the added bonus that the online version could be updated immediately as soon as a new word or provenance is included.  Bearing all this in mind, we feel that it would enrich our culture if everybody had free and regularly-updated access to this fine publication.",
