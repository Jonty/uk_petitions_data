Try working for a month as a teacher/supply teacher to give you a taste of what the reality is then return to your office and scrap your plans, draw up and implement procedures to support the TEACHERS who are responsible for our childrens futures.  You may LEARN a great deal yourself, in particular, why so many teachers leave the profession after such a short time!",
