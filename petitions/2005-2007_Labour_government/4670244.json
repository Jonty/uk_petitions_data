        "background": "Introduce new planning regulations to control/cap the numbers of second homes / holiday lets in areas of natural beauty, where ownership causes a detrimental effect to the sustainability of Communities such as Cornwall and Cumbria.\nConcurrently introduce a new second homes impact charge to fund local authorities to buy back such second homes that are returned to the housing stock market as affordable housing for local people instead of building new low cost affordable homes in green field areas. The current policy will create second class areas in which the persons housed will feel like second class citizens. The subsequent effect will be social problems in the years to come.",
