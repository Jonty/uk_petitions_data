            "background": "Make a final candidate entry date for the EU (.e.g. 2020) to resolve the European continent question of what countries are in Europe and so the EU  can integrate without a new country joining and interfering with the integration (this would also benefit because money wouldn\u2019t have to be spent on a new member and would not result in a influx on immigrants to member states which is a major issue). Buy making the final entry date round about 2020 would allow the potential candidates to join. Make only other way to join (loop-hole) after the final entry date is by being a country entirely surrounded by the EU (.e.g. Switzerland, Norway, micro nations) and dependant territories of EU states (this would make it less awkward for a country surrounded by the EU and these countries are well developed). [Moldova, Ukraine, Belarus and Russia could be considered Asian countries as they were part of the Mongolian empire].",
