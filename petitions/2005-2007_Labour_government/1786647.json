            "background": "For to long Britain has suffered from weak decisions on its infrastructure investment. Politicians seem happy to move with an often misinformed public feeling to protect all that we have historically, and at the cost of our place in the global economy. \n\nIn France, Germany and in Japan we see the fruits of world class infrastructure, where the past is respected, but the investment in the road and rail infrastructure ensures the wellbeing of the nation, here they build it fast, straight and properly, without conceding to the the demands of those who would rather see their nation frozen in history.\n\nWe need to make the correct decisions for the future of this country, or face our children becoming nothing more than tour guides to theme park Britain. Lets not sacrifice our future for our past, we need to secure our past, it is important, but not if we do not have a future to celebrate it it in.",
