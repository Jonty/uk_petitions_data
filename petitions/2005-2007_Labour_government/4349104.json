Id cards yes but signing your ethnicity, wrong. It is nothing to do with statistics, passports are enough Identification.Why ahould it matter what colour someone is? If your British and White, Black, Mixed or Asian isn't that enough. Why scrutinize the people who are born here? A form is not a person, it does not respond to inequality. In favour of fairness, and equality they should be banned and all notion regarding statisics of ethnicity should be banned.",
