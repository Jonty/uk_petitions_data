            "background": "I am a young driver and I am fed up being discriminated against by older people who say we have it too easy. I passed my test in 2003 after 4 attempts. As my instructor said to me; it was not that I was a bad driver it was because the test is so difficult. A senior driving expert was even recently quoted to have said it is offically the hardest L-driver test in the world. The test is more than difficult enough already. I think the problem is that there is no proper punishment for unsafe drivers and a lack of proper traffic police. Young drivers aren't the only ones who drive recklessly and its about time that fact was acknowledged.",
