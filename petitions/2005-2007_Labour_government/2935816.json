            "background": "Provision of a broadband service is still treated as an add-on to an existing telephone line. Instead, all telephone lines should automatically be enabled for broadband. This would include the provision of both a data and voice socket at each telephone connection point within every home. The cost of broadband is also currently treated as an add-on cost. Instead, it should be included within the existing fixed line rental cost of a telephone line.",
