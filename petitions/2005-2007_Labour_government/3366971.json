        "background": "This petition is to propose the development of a literacy test for immigrants in written, aural and oral forms of the English language. The tests should cover a broad range of topics and alternate between content to ensure no one particular test can be memorized. In order to maintain the standard of literacy within the UK those entering must first pass a series of tests to ensure their fluency in English. NO PASS, NO ENTRY",
