        "background": "Most major cities such as Leeds and Birmingham suffer from congestion. We believe the best solution is to take the traffic and commuting public below the surface. This will be expensive but, if we are to be taxed to ease congestion, surely we should be offered a solution in return for our money. Traffic calming measures, bus lanes and overground trams etc have only made matters worse. It is time to deal with the problem of transport and congestion head on. This, we believe, would be a real investment in the nation\u2019s future and a viable solution to the problem.",
