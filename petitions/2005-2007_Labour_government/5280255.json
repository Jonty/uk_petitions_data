        "action": "actually take a look at motorway driving speeds and realise that the majority of drivers safely tootle along at 85 miles per hour without incident.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The goverments response to an earlier petition stated that they thought more accidents would happen if the limit was increased. BUT if any goverment minister took the time and effort to check speeds on motorways (do any of them drive themselves?) they would obviously see that the majority of traffic flow is already well above the LEGAL limit. The problems occur when idiots/inexperienced/foreigners, insist on hogging the middle lanes causing interrupted flow of traffic, or people driving at ridiculously slow speeds. There should be a maximum speed limit of 85MPH (even small engine cars are capable of doing 100MPH + these days) and a minimum of 60MPH. If you daren't go that fast, you should consider another route. Oh and dont even think of getting me started on lorries taking 5 miles to pass another lorry on a 2 lane dual carriage way!!!!",
