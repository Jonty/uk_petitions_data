        "background": "I am petitioning the Prime Minister to scrap all benefits to Non British citizens & pull out of the agreement made in the Geneva Convention for refugees & close our borders to immigration. The Geneva Convention agreement was for real refugees fleeing persecution. Our benefits system is a magnet to immigrants who come here, are housed,fed,watered,given NHS care & money to live, never having paid a penny into the system. As British Citizens you are entitled to next to nothing. We pay into a system all our lives, & the system fails us. Yet immigrants are coming here & taking out of a system not designed for them. Where else in the World can you go and claim benefits-you can't. Taxes, a Gov't squeezing every drop of blood out of us, & throwing the cash at immigrants. What could be achieved for this Country if all these Billions of \u00a3 were not given away. No benefit system & benefits, would all these immigrants come here? Justice for Britain.",
