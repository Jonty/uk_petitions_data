            "background": "For nearly 300 years Scots have endured a barrage of such rhetoric which has sapped our innate Vitality and optimism. However I am asking the question 'Is it True?' Do the English Taxpayers really subsidize the Scots?\n\nThe Total UK Taxation Revenues for the year to the 5th April 1999 were \u00a3356,800.000 Million pounds (356.8 Billions) let us assume that figure is 100% of the total Taxation. Scotland with 8.6% of the population contributed \u00a341,346,600 Million Pounds (41.346 Billions) or 11.6% of the total UK Tax revenues. In return, under the Barnet Formula, Scotland received \u00a312.2 Billion Pounds or 3.4%!\n\nFar from England subsidizing Scotland, the reverse is true. Scots are subsidizing the South East of England, and in particular London Which received \u00a389.7 Billion pounds of Government expenditure or 25% and this does not include health, Education or Defence. No wonder the Treasury wishes to keep it quiet! This has been going on for years.\n\nIn the U.K. the average number of Pensioners working is 6.6% of all pensioners. However in Scotland the ratio is 9.4%!.",
