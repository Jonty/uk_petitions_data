        "background": "It is absurd that bbc news and radio spend half of the time talking about forthcoming bbc shows and ignore the real news. You have interviews with 'stars' just to plug a show or important consumer shows being twisted to fit in with a new show that is coming soon. Then you have the obvious product placement on the fewc shows thatarte not repeats. Finally, you then have the jokes about how the bbc is impartial yet something is then plugged for about 5 minutes. If another broadcaster tried this they would be slated, by the bbc, yet these double standards are allowed to occur.",
