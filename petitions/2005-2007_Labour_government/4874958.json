            "background": "The English government classes people of 16 as Adults - they can leave school, work full time, have a baby, get married, leave home, etc. At 18 there they have no restrictions. \n\nStudents, aged 18, going to University:\n- Spend at least \u00a328,000 for 3 years full time study away from home\n- Normally funded by student loans\n- Government's lesson is - build up horrendous debts from 18, and don't worry, repayments are deferred while interest grows at the rate of inflation. \n\nSome students receive grants:\n- Maintenance Grants of \u00a32,765, and \u00a31,000 Higher Education Grant\n- They could live at home and complete a degree with loans or debt\n- The student does nothing, except attend, to be eligible\n- Their parents earn less than \u00a316,340\n\nOther students receive no grant at all:\n- What have these Adults done to deserve exclusion and discrimination? Nothing! \n- Their parents earn above \u00a338,330\n\nAt College, some students aged 16 & 17:\n- Receive \u00a330 per week EMA just to attend\n- Most live at home, near the college\n- Most spend the grant on enjoyment (80% on cigarettes)\n- Receive nothing if parents earn above \u00a330,810.\n\nThese people are Adults and should be assessed independently from their parents income.",
