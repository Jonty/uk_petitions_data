            "background": "I believe it is unfair that car insurance companies are charging up to 30% APR for people who cannot afford to pay their years premium in one payment thus adding up to 4 months worth of extra payments just in interest charges. I think the government should cap this interest at a more reasonable figure, after all it it is a legal requirement to have the insurance in the first place.",
