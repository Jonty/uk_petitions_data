            "background": "Under the current rules, you have to be actively seeking work to qualify for Jobseekers Allowance. Fair comment for those who do. As soon as you are offered a job, and inform the Jobcentre, the allowance stops, irrespective of when you will actually start work. I received a firm offer with a start date 4 weeks into the future and being an honest British citizen, I informed the jobcentre. My allowance was stopped and I had nothing for 4 weeks. (Not to mention I then had to survive a month at work until I was paid). This is wrong and I believe that the benefit rules should be changed to pay the claimant up to the date they actually START work. After all, once we start we'll be paying TAX and NI again to cover what was paid to us!!",
