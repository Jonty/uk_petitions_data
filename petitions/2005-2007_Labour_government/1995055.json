            "background": "The Saturday morning show TISWAS reigned supreme amongst children, students and those of us nursing hangovers on Saturday mornings in the late '70s and early '80s. Society as a whole has suffered badly since it faded from view, to be supplanted by rubbish cookery shows and inferior imitations. One condition of its revival should be the compulsory appearance of Sally James, wearing thigh boots, a tight t-shirt and covered in a baked bean/semolina mixture.",
