A bank holiday on Saint Georges Day would be a great opportunity for all the English (regardless of colour or religion) to recognise what binds us together - instead of concentrating on our differences.\nNorthern Ireland already has a bank holiday on St. Patrick's Day, the Scottish Parliament has introduced a bill to make St. Andrew's Day a bank holiday and the Welsh Assembly agree that St. David's Day should be a holiday.\nHelp me persuade the government to give England a bank holiday on St Georges Day.",
