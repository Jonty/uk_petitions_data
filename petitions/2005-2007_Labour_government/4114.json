        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current use of traffic cameras is criminalising a large section of the population,but not tackling the root cause of the problem. Many drivers today took their driving tests many years ago, during which time driving conditions and the highway code have changed. Government should reduce the spread or use of traffic cameras, and instead institute a programme of retests, with all drivers required to resit a driving test every 5 or 10 years. At the same time, a national programme of road safety training should be implemented through schools to improve pedestrian safety.",
