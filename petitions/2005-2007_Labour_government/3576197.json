WE CANNOT ACCEPT THIS!\nThe Hunting Act 2004\nand its exemptions! The Act allows the use of up to two dogs to stalk and flush out wild mammals from cover, in order to prevent or reduce serious damage which the wild mammal would otherwise cause. This includes damage to livestock, game birds or wild birds, food for livestock and crops. This exemption requires that reasonable steps are taken to ensure that as soon as possible after being found or flushed out the wild mammal is shot dead by a competent person, and that each dog used is kept under sufficiently close control to ensure that it does not prevent or obstruct this.\n\nThe Government has no plans to amend the Hunting Act.",
