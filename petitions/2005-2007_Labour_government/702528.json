            "background": "After the 'right to buy' scheme created by the last government, local authorities have failed to replace housing stock. Many use private sector housing, meaning many people pay extortionate rates of rent for sub-standard housing. This is unacceptable and is leading to an even wider rich/poor divide. Those who can afford to buy their own homes or develop land are pushing rent and house prices higher and many can now not afford even the deposit required to get on the 'property ladder'.",
