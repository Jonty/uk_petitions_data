        "background": "Stop the overpriced waste of tax payers money on websites for each MP costing  \u00a310,000 for a website. Websites are not that dear to maintain and if an MP cannot maintain his own website he shouldn't have one. Many people have websites and maintain them for less than \u00a3100. This is a unnecessary and a total waste of tax payers money. The MPs if they want one can pay for them out of their own wages and not as an added expense. This money can be better spent on things for the community instead of spiralling the costs on the poor man to use as a MP\u2019s pr advert. Most workers will already lose out in taxation in 12months when they are taxed double and earn less than MPs, these people have no expense allowances over their wages. \n\nThe Labour party seem to be on a self destruct mode and thinking of wasting  \u00a310,000 per website, per MP is the red button to cause the explosion.\n\nTime to say enough is enough stop the crazy idea now!",
