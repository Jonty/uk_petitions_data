            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At present, applications for student finance are based on a student's parents' income. This means that if a students parents' earn more than \u00a340,000 a year the student can receive a maximum loan of \u00a33000 a year, this does not even cover university accommodation fees. Many parents will not pay for their children to attend university as they are under no legal obligation to do so. This prevents not the poor from going to university but the middle class.\n\nIronically, if a student chooses to marry before university they are considered independent of their parents' income and are eligible for upto a total of \u00a34750 a year in non-repayable grants!\n\nStudents are legally adults and their application for finance should be treated as such. It should not be based on their parents' income and all students should be entitled to the same financial help.",
