            "background": "It is about time that the Prime Minister recognised our countrys traditions and values and began to respect them. The recent unlawful capture of our countrymen in Iran has showed how weak we can be and has proved to the rest of the world how we have let our guard down. Great Britain has always been a proud and decisive nation, this has declined dramatically over the past few years due to the mixing of culture and the unrecognition of our countrys great past. We ask the Prime Minister to focus his attention on how we Great Britain appear to the rest of the world, and to realise the importance of our tradition and its values in this country.",
