AFC Wimbledon are appealing for this points deduction to be overturned.\n\nWe feel this goes against natural justice and the reason the rule was put in place. Namely to stop clubs from taking other teams players although there is no suggestion that happened in this case.\n\nWe do not see why AFC Wimbledon should be considered a special case. They should accept their punishment.",
