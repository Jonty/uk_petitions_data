            "background": "Some deprived areas, particularly in Wales are being regenerated by encouraging businesses to open buildings in their area by paying inducements, in the form of 'Regional Selective Assistance' grants. In theory this is good for the UK as a whole but the Welsh Assembly and some companies are abusing the system. Large IT companies for example are receiving inducements and taking on staff in Wales, then making staff for whom they do not receive inducements redundant in England. Some of the employees losing their jobs in England also live or work in deprived areas. I believe that the government should make companies pay back their 'Regional Selective Assistance' grants and make them ineligible for further grants if they do this. The Welsh Assembly and other regional governments should also be held accountable to ensure that they are not encouraging job losses elsewhere in the UK.",
