            "background": "We believe that the the UK should have a national recycling policy. Living in an area of outstanding natural beauty and a popular holiday destination we find that visitors are confused about our local recycling policy as it is different from that which they are used to at home. This often results in bins not being emptied as they contain \"non-recyclable materials\". We believe that a national policy would aid not only our own area's recycling attempts, but those of other major holiday destinations and the nation in general to achieve more effective disposal of waste items.",
