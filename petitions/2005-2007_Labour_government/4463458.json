        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The NT is planning to introduce a flock of around 150 sheep on their land at Cheddar Gorge, to ensure that the Gorge is well grazed and that the encroachment of scrub and secondary woodland is held back.   This flock of sheep will need to be managed and the NT must decide between introducing cattle grids at top and bottom of the Gorge or to run a fence alongside the main road down through the Gorge.\n\nAnother option would be to increase the number of feral soay sheep and continue the annual removal of encroaching scrub and trees as at present.\n\nIntroducing cattle grids or increasing the number of feral soay sheep are both vastly preferable options to fencing in the gorge.\n\nFencing in the Gorge would change the open character of the Gorge forever. It would signal wrongly to future generations, that land which is meant to be open access is actually out of bounds.",
