            "background": "The solution to moving travellers from car to public transport is not rocket science.  No one likes being stuck in traffic, but if the alternative is to find the change for a bus ticket to the station, then pay for a train ticket, and maybe another bus ticket the other end, the change will not happen.  \n\nBut people do use public transport throughout our near European neighbours.  Not only do they have highly developed bus, tram and rail systems, these are also easy to use.  They sell single tickets for use on all types of public transport in their cities, not just bus or train, peak or off-peak, daily, weekly or monthly.  \n\nWe can also do this.  We even manage to do this in London.  We demand similar travelcard schemes throughout the UK.  And make them affordable.",
