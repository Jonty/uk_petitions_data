        "background": "The FA have announced the first team to play England at the brand new Wembley Stadium will be from South America. I believe that the first match should include a team with which England have a long lasting rivalry and history. Therefore I am petitioning to make the first game a match between England and either Scotland or Germany. It should be these teams as England regularly played home nation games with Scotland, and a great atmosphere is guaranteed. The Germans should take part as there is no greater rivalry in world football than England v Germany, and it would be good to see the last game at the old Wembley repeated for the first game at the new Wembley. If you agree, please sign this petition, and we must be quick, as the game will take place very soon!",
