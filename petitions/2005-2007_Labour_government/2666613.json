            "background": "Instead of banging on about smokers all the time shouldn't the government be looking at the dangers of heavy drinking.  I can't believe that we still have advertisements on the TV for alcohol.  There are more dangers involved in this problem than with smoking but because almost everyone drinks!! the problems seem to be swept under the carpet.  Is Britain so drunk that it's not seen anymore.  Please do something.  Most of the crime in this country is related to drinking and/or drugs especially with young people and nothing seems to be done.  It doesn't seem possible for people to have a good time without getting out of their heads.  What a world we live in.  \n\nThank you \nDistressed and fed up Lancastrian",
