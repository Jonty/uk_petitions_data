        "background": "The double act between Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson has changed the face of British comedy over the past 30 years.\n\nThey pioneered the 'alternative' comedy movement in the early eighties, and over the last two decades bought the successful anarchic sitcoms \"The Young Ones\" and \"Bottom\" to our television screens. They built on their success with numerous national theatre tours, and a film, and gained a great following.\n\nThey have also each found great solo success, most noticeably Rik with \"The New Statesman\" and Ade in \"Holby City\" and \"Jonathan Creek\".\n\nWe would like to see them both named in the Queen's birthday honours list for services to comedy.",
