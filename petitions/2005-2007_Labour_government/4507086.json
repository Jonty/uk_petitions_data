            "background": "The governmnent should ban new people from taking up smoking.\n\nThis could be done by creating some sort of licencing scheme or prescription scheme allowing existing smokers to purchase cigarettes whereby they must prove that they are addicted to smoking, such a licence should have a deadline date (ie 3 Years) to sign up by.\n\nThe licences should be non transferable and licence holders cannot purchase cigarettes for a third party, heavy punishment should be given if these rules are broken, people who give up should have their licence cancelled.\n\nThis would effectively ban smoking after all the licence holders have died and gradually reduce the number of smokers but still fare to those who are addicted.",
