THE SYSTEM DOES NOT ALLOW SUCH PEOPLE TO GET WHAT THEY ARE ENTITLED TO WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL OF INVESTIGATION, RESEARCH AND FORM FILLING.  TO FOLLOW THERE IS A LONG WAIT FOR THE AUTHORITIES TO AGREE TO ANY ENTITLEMENTS TO EVEN NON-MEANS TESTED BENIFITS OR NECESSARY HELP IN THE HOME. OFTEN THE PROCESS INVOLVES MAKING AN APPEAL.   \nTHE CURRENT SYSTEM IS NOT USER FRIENDLY OR CARING AND OFTEN SERVICES PROMISED ARE NOT IMPLEMENTED DUE TO UNDERFUNDED SERVICE PROVISION AT LOCAL LEVEL.  PLEASE REVIEW THE CURRENT SYSTEM.",
