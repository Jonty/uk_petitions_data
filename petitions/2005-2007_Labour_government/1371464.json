            "background": "Since he became a cabinet minister John Reid has presided over failure after failure. Now that he has risen to the position of Home Secretary he has caused the prisons crisis and the immigration crisis to name but a few.\n\nMost dangerously it would appear that everytime Reid fails there is a anti-terror raid and a repeated call to detain people without trial. Therefore it would appear that he is dangerously incompetent and tries to cover this fact by eroding the underpinnings of British society.",
