            "action": "withdraw all financial subsidies given towards wind power generation and use the money saved to finance free issue of at least two low energy lamps (light bulbs) to every household in Britain.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At present the state gives subsidies in various formats to the power generation industry to build and supply electrical energy through wind power.\n\nThis process does not encourage energy saving but merely changes the way that electricity is produced, the energy demand stays the same. In addition\nthe subsidies inflate the cost of electricity maintaining a higher price to the consumer than would be sustained without subsidies. However if the subsidies where removed and the money saved used to finance at least two low energy lamps (light bulbs) per household in Britain, the energy demand \nwould be reduced and there would be less or possibly no need for wind power stations. In addition the consumers will benefit by lower power consumption and hence lower fuel bills.\n\nThe lamps could be issued as vouchers that are redeemable at electrical, DIY and supermarket stores, the voucher system should then be repeated every 5 years or thereabouts as the lamps need replacing.",
