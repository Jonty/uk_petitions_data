            "background": "Official DNA test results show conclusively that around 1/3 of paternity claims are fraudulent. \n\nGiven that the average cost of raising a child is estimated at \u00a3150,000, this amounts to billions of pounds of criminal fraud, wrecked homes, and emotional trauma.\n\nPaternity fraud could be cheaply, easily and completely abolished by the introduction of free paternity tests.\n\nThe state rightly provides free maternity pay, grants, prescriptions, milk, and supplements. But millions of victims of paternity crime receive no help.\n\nWe believe that the government should prevent paternity fraud by introducing free paternity tests, by legally enforcing compliance with these tests, by criminalizing paternity fraudsters, and by supporting victims who wish to legally reclaim stolen funds.",
