            "background": "With current laws, few under 18\u2019s are introduced to sports (which are implicitly dangerous), so child obesity is at record levels and doesn\u2019t seem set to change. This is because organisers of any activity must complete lengthy paperwork- risk assessments, qualification assessments and also obtain formal parental consent to cover themselves from legal action if the minor is injured. Hence, less adults are willing to take minors out because they are not professional instructors- they have jobs, and so do not have enough time to complete the necessary paperwork. If the paperwork is not completed and minor is injured then the organiser may lose possessions, or even their house if the parents decide to take legal action. This is a petition to relax the laws for this, so if the minor is injured then the organizer or any of the participants will not face prosecution unless the injury was as a result of direct negligence or forcing the minor to do something beyond their skill level.",
