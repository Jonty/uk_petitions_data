            "background": "I have noticed a major increase in alot of drivers hogging the outside lane. These drivers are not overtaking anything and the lane to their left is completely empty. They sit in their own world and do not notice drivers behind them trying to pass them, this driver then has no other choice but to do an illegal act and undercut this oblivious driver! As we all know this is a very dangerous move and should be avoided at all times but sometimes it has to be done. The people who sit in the outside lane should be the ones that get fined not the other driver who only wants to pass. If the law is passed that the obstructing driver is fined and/or given points you can guarantee the roads will become less congested and a safer place. Please sign below if you agree.",
