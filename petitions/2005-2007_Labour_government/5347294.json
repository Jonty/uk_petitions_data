        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Hackney Council plans to exclude 30 streets in Stamford Hill from normal planning protection, extension restrictions will be relaxed & dimensions increased,Hackney council feels that the streetscape is already damaged by abuses of planning permission,due to a period of corruption within the planning office,yet many of the streets included in the draft have been untouched & remain true to their Victorian character. Consultation ended with the majority of the residents affected unaware of the proposals, no letters were sent out,a small article in the local paper made some aware. Stamford Hill streetscapes have a unique Victorian character,the area of exclusion would allow the character & heritage to be lost to inappropriate developments, & increase the density of occupation in already crowded streets. this petition is to request a fair & open consultation with the residents who will be affected by the proposals.to request the consultation document visit conservation.design@hackney.gov.uk",
