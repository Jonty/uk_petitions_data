        "background": "Putting children into nursery is expensive for all so the choices are:\nHave no children, have 1 child or stay at home. If childcare was free then anyone who wished to work could do so and those who did work could afford to have more than one child. Likewise those who chose to be at home could do so because they wanted to and not because they had no other option.  This would benefit the economy and the socio economic structure.",
