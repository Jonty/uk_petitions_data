        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As you may have heard, Sky have recently taken away basic channels from Virgin media, now Sky's biggest rivals.\n\nThe easy thing to do would be to switch to Sky. Sky believe the channels taken away will be enough to take business away from rivals, and in turn increase their dominance in the television industry.\n\nI do not believe this right.\n\nThe harder thing to do would be to petition against the increasingly powerful company. It doesn't take much. The only we can prevent decisions such as this being taken is to stand up together.\n\nIf you do not believe in this either, please sign this petition.",
