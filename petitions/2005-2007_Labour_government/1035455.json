            "background": "The current system of Fixed Penalty Notices/Tickets (FPT) is unfairly biased against the driver. If you are unsure as to whether or not you broke the law and would like to view the evidence the police hold against you, you are unable to unless the matter is taken to court where, if found guilty you will recive a greater fine and the posibility of more than 3 penalty points thus putting the driver under pressure forcing many to agree to the FPT. This is not a claim of money making but of a breach in our human rights - the  FPT system makes us guilty until proven innocent, not the other way around as should be. \n\nAs said before the threat of a large fine and more points keeps many people from viewing the evidence against them which, as can be seen from recent cases, could be severely flawed.\n\nRemember the FPT system is clearley Guilty Until Proven Innocent.",
