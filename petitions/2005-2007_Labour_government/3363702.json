Does Chris Wick, environment manager, live in Newhaven?\n\nEast Sussex County has totally ignored the people of Newhaven on their views on this project.\nI hope people will turn against local councillors in next year's elections.\n\nNewhaven residents are fed up with being treated like secondclass citizens.",
