            "background": "The unwritten constitution of this country is predicated upon the doctrine of ministerial responsibility where, in the event of a problem arising within a department of government, the minister is personally responsible, whether or not he had personal dealings with the problem.  The failure of ministers (many of whom have legal training) to resign or otherwise take responsibility for failings within their departments undermines the rule of law and suggests that this government is more concerned with power than responsibility.",
