            "background": "In April 2007 changed the ORCON standard to 8 minutes from when the phone rings in control.This is the ORCON standard and is the only tool used to measure ambulance efficiency. It means that if the ambulance arrives within 8 minutes and the patient is dead, we have succeeded.But arrive in 8 minutes 1 second, and  resuscitate the patient we have failed in the eyes of  ORCON as we didn't make it in 8 minutes.The service is deemed to be inefficient.This is a silly and totally unrealistic idea.It is a discriminatory standard as it means ambulance trusts have to place their resources near to the big towns and cities as they will have a higher volume of calls than rural areas.If you are taken seriously ill in a rural area you will have to wait longer for an ambulance to reach you.\u201cORCON (Operational Research CONsultancy) was developed in 1974 as a standard for monitoring ambulance service performance).Because ambulance services were now part of the NHS and no longer under county council control. They carried no more than bandages and oxygen.Today we carry defibrillators, thrombolytics,our skill base is higher than it has ever been, but are still measured by standards set thirty years ago",
