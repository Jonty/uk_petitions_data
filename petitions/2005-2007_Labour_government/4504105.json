As the most popular station in the country it provides a valuable service to the country as a whole, and to international relations in its exemplary standards. These standards help to make Radio 2 a part of people's lives that usually only another person could fill. For this reason, I petition the government to include BBC Radio 2 in its honours lists, and to give it the recognition and credit it deserves. Let us make history and be the first people to listen to Sir Radio 2.",
