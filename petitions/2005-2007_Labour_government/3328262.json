        "background": "It makes sense, when they have worn out the inside lanes HGV's can be diverted onto the hard shoulder for carridgeway repairs. Coupled with flexability in the work place theres no need for pay as you go driving.\n Parliment wont like that though because all they want is revenue.\nWe have been robbed long enough.\nIf they dont sort it we should all remove our number plates in protest can you imagine the chaos.\nI just wish these obnoctious MPs would listen to the people.\nBlairs response to our petition on pay as  you drive is typical, no wonder people dont vote.\nThe Health service is a mess, so is transport, we dont have alternatives.\nGas , water and electric are privatised what exactly are we voting for with these people. Its about time we re-nationalised and stood together to make this country great again, some how i think were too late.\nGive us our freedom back our roads are choked to death!",
