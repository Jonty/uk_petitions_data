For people who \u201cWill Not Pay\u201d pursue the debt with Regulated, Trained and Monitored staff of Bailiff\u2019s. For the people who are \u201cUnable To Pay\u201d replace the Bailiff system altogether.",

            "background": "The Free Market Economy has encouraged the UK population into a Trillion Pound\u2019s worth of debt. The Government has introduced \u201cIndividual Voluntary Arrangements\u201d to reduce the occurrence of Bankruptcy but we still see \u201cDraconian\u201d methods handed out at the hands of thugs who work for Bailiffs. This should be outlawed as a thing of the Victorian Era as was done with Debtors Prison.\n\nIn the 21st Centaury, upright, law abiding citizens who have fallen on hard times should not be subject to heavy handed methods, metered out by large intimidating individuals who could be seen as \u201cDemanding Monies with Menaces\u201d (or we will take your goods).\n\nThere is a distinct difference between people who will not pay a debt, but have the \u201cwhere with all\u201d to do so, and the individual who cannot pay because of the loss of income due to redundancy or pregnancy, to name but two reasons.",
