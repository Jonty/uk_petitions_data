        "background": "For too long the despotic regime in Zimbabwe has breached human rights openly and blatantly. Sanctions are only harming the people of Zimbabwe, not the Government. Therefore I propose that further action is needed in the form of a UN force which could provide protection for the people of Zimbabwe who wish to have democracy returned to their country. If abuses were to still continue then Robert Mugabe should be brought before the ICC in the Hague to answer charges of human rights abuses. The longer the world stands back, the worse it will get.",
