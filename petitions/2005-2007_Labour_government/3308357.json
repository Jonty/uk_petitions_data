            "background": "People are currently able to get financial assistance from the government if they do not hold a degree and this can often lead to incentives for people to enter further education even if they are not interested in doing so but they can think of no better option.\n\nPeople that hold degrees should still be given help to if they wish to improve themselves in other fields.  This would make the workforce much more flexible as it improves the incentive for people who have the desire to move into developing markets.",
