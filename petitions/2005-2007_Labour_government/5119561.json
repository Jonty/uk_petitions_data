        "background": "Russia seems more and more to be embracing fascism:\nA dissident is killed in London with a rare radioactive compound that could only be state produced.\nThere are attacks on countries formerly in, or allied to, the Soviet Union: the Ukraine, Estonia, Poland, etc.\nRussian oil and gas is used as a weapon against Europe and commercial companies are robbed of their Russian assets.\nGay rights activists from Russia and all over Europe are assaulted and then arrested in Moscow.\nBy now, isn't the West starting to think that Putin, the KGB and the Russian Orthodox Nationalists are fascists with closet homosexual tendencies?\n\nSurely the least the British Government can do is put forward a number of censor motions against Russia at the United Nations on human rights grounds?  They can start with a protest against the treatment of Peter Tatchell.",
