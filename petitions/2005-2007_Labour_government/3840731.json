            "background": "The petitioner demanding the Paisley knighthood is typical of Liverpool fans. He wants one to be awarded simply because Alex Fegruson got one at Manchester United.\n\nIf Paisley gets one where does it stop? Stein and Clough both won the European Cup too.  Clough even knocked Paisley out of the competition (2 - 0 on aggregate), surely that deserved a knighthood in itself!!!!\n\nBut in all seriousness what is the point?  Paisley won't know about it and it won't make him a better manager.\n\nFerguson's ward was premature and unnecessary. An award to Paisley would be equally ridiculous.",
