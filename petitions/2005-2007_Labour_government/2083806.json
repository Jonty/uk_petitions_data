            "background": "As we, and our friends on the continent already know, the road surfaces generally in this 'Great' country of ours are some of the worst in the whole of the western world. Increasingly it gets harder negotiating around potholes, large puddles, very badly patched in roadworks and other unnecessary annoyances in conventional automobiles. Currently and justifiably there is a big wave moving away from the use of urban 4X4's but these vehicles are becoming increasingly ideal against the scurge of the above not to mention speed bumps. This is counterproductive and causes more pollution.",
