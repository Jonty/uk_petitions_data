            "action": "amend the regulations regarding the hire of 7.5 tonne vans to small businesses",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Current regulations demand multiple forms and licenses to hire a 7.5 tonne van for business use. The process can take 10 weeks or more, and cost over \u00a3500 in fees, if a business wishes to hire a 7.5 tonne van for EVEN ONE DAY. A small company can't afford this for very occasional use, forcing us to hire 2 smaller vans, or one van for more than one day, both at great expense. The current legislation restricts us to a specific hire firm - if they have no vehicle available on that day, we can't go anywhere else, in spite of the fees we have paid, and the licenses we hold.",
