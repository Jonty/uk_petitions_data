        "background": "Climate change has always happened and always will, without any intervention from humans. There is no proof that co2 has the capability to increase the planets temperature by any significant amount. Also the vast majority of co2 is naturaly occuring and the pitiful amount humans produce is insignificant.\n\nThe planet is not going to stop changing just because humans have arrived. Stop trying to scare people into giving up their liberties and tax pounds, especially when you go around the world giving it large and created more climate change by blowing up countries than anything a billion cars could do.\n\nThere is no consensus either, many people including David Bellamy, absolutely belive we should focus on the real problems governments have caused and not this voodoo science.",
