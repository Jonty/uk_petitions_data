            "background": "The UK taxpayer is the unsung hero of the country. Without us, there would be no NHS, Welfare System, Armed Forces, etc etc.\n\nThe Radio 2 Presenter Ken Bruce, had the idea that all UK taxpayers should be allowed a year off paying tax on a significant birthday (40th, 50th..).\n\nThis would be a superbe idea, and a way of the Government to thank the hard working men & women of this country who keep the wheels moving.\n\nDuring this year, the investment of that capital would have a beneficial effect on the economy, be it 'sensibly' invested, or used to buy goods.\n\nAfter many years of paying tax, and with more years of paying tax afterwards, this one year holiday is richly deserved.",
