            "background": "I've just seen a documentary which reported on several people who died because, due to targets that ambulances have to reach patients within 8 minutes, an ambulance containing one or more technicians, rather than paramedics, was sent simply because it was nearer and more likely to get there within the 8 minutes.  But there are many procedures which technicians can't practise, only paramedics can, so these patients died; in addition technicians don't even carry the equipment for these procedures so even if a family member or friend had the knowledge to apply them it wouldn't make any difference.",
