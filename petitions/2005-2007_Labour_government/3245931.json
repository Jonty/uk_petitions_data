            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The relief for Pension Funds of the 20% tax on Corporate Profits was removed by the Chancellor in 1997, on the grounds that, 'Pension Funds were awash with cash'\nThis may have been true at that time, and it removed an estimated \u00a35 billion per annum from Pension Funds.\nUK Pension Funds are no longer awash with cash, but rather with the anguish of Members who feel robbed, after years of sacrifices to ensure a comfortable Retirement.\nSince that time, financial pressures have built up which have severely damaged the viability of UK Pension Funds, especially the Defined Benefit schemes. (linked to Final Salaries) \n Cannot the same people who defended the original removal of the Tax relief, ask themselves the same question now; if they concede that Pension Funds are no longer cash-rich, then reintroduce the Tax Relief\n(Or risk having to pay an equivalent sum each year to Pensioners in poverty, via some degrading 'Means-tested' scheme)",
