            "background": "Apart from Derek Griffiths in the 70s, i cant think of another children presenter since who has brought Sign Language/Makaton to mainstream childrens televison. Justin Fletcher is a communication genius!!\nJustin both entertains and educates our children and does this with just intelligence and panache without patronising.  \nMy 3 year old daughter has no learning/hearing disabiliies to speak of, yet she signs words she has learnt, to me sometimes, and she is so proud of herself for doing it. \nAlthough at my daughters age now she is not yet aware of people with disability and special needs, i cant help thinking that programmes like 'Something Special' can only help bridge the gap that sometimes sadly appears between able and not so able bodied people in our society and help banish the unkindness that disabled people sometimes face due to ignorance. I have a feeling our children may be the generation to banish this ignorance, and this is helped by such positive role models as Justin, helping us show our children the way.\nI think it would be fitting to recognise Justin Fletcher in this way and be honoured for his services to childrens broadcasting and communication in general.",
