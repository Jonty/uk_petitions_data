        "background": "I am petitioning to reduce the amount of benefits people who contribute very little to the economy receive \u2013 seemingly just to keep their vote. I\u2019m sure many people are fed up with working long hard hours to earn enough for your family to live, only then for us to be taxed massively, when other families don\u2019t lift a finger and get every thing given to them on a platter. There are people who deserve benefits - genuinely ill people, people with disabilities that mean work is possible, or people who work and don\u2019t earn enough to pay the bills. However I do not agree with the comfy lives people who don\u2019t want to work receive. \n\nI, like many of this great countries population, have worked hard to buy a house, car etc and am coming increasing perplexed about the amount of our money that is channeled in to the benefit system. Give people a reason and incentive to work hard, don\u2019t make life so comfy for the work shy, lazy minority and just maybe you\u2019ll get re-elected \u2013 remember there are more of us decent hard working people who are just waiting for one party to realize this and start to drag this back to its feet by rewarding hard work.",
