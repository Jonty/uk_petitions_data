            "background": "We are at an energy crossroads. Now is the time to be honest about the long term unaffordability of nuclear power, and its' inherent dangers to the environment, which could make these Islands uninhabitable and is far too great a risk to take. What this country needs is to become the world leader in what will become the biggest sector of the energy generating market, renewables. We are in an excellent position from the point of view of geographic location and technical expertise to be able to do this, and could then become a symbol of hope for the new way forward, and a major exporter of this technology to all parts of the world. We further urge the Prime Minister to conduct an honest public review of energy policy next time around, and also to remember the lessons of history - we can never have an accident-free nuclear industry, it is simply not possible given human nature, fallability and the dynamic natural environment.",
