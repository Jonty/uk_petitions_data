            "background": "Edinburgh city council recently imposed new parking restrictions known as the extension of controlled parking zone or CPZ.  Allthough there are resident permits available, no provision for parking for small businesses has been made; this has allready cost huge amounts of money to businesses that need company vehicles in the course of trade and also vastly increased journey times.  Since many permit spaces are unused during the working day this should be easily rectifiable and business do not mind a small annual charge.  Further to this as a result of completely losing all free parking spaces businesses within the affected area have also experienced a huge drop in sales.  Therefore this petition requests urgently that the first 30 minutes of parking should be free of charge for everyone and that business permits should be provided for every local business for a reasonable annual sum.",
