We, the undersigned, believe it is a scandal that our hard-earned taxes are being sent to Poland as child benefit for children of Polish workers in this country.  We are already allowing Poles to work in this country, in some cases taking jobs from our own citizens.  Benefits for their offspring in Poland on top is taking things too far.  If necessary the UK needs to challenge seriously European Union rules on this.",
