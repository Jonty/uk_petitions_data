            "background": "We have a crisis in this country when it comes to food.  We have many unhealthy people and many fat people, and the best part of two or three generations who actually do not know how to cook and prepare food.  We also have a serious lack of understanding and appreciation of where food comes from and the impact our current food system has on the environment. \n\nThis coincides with the reduction of food education in schools to the point where at primary schools it usually falls to a committed parent to run an occasional club and at secondary schools it's become a part of 'Design Technology' taught for maybe one term a year.\n\nIt is vital that we start to teach children about food and how to feed themselves and others.  There are obvious health benefits, and many social and environmental benefits to be had from this.",
