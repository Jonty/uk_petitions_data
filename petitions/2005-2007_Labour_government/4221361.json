I have run a company now for three years and the sleepless nights come from the amount I, and the company, are taxed, while also ensuring I keep my costs and prices low.    \n\nWhy do we bare a greater burden than established, larger businesses?  My customers are large multinationals (so generally their profits will go overseas anyhow), should I now give it all up and work for them instead?",
