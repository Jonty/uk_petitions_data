            "background": "The premise for the current property tax system is out of date and unfair.\n\nThe property tax system should be REFORMED AND REPLACED WITH A LOCAL CITIZEN TAX(this is the action I am requesting) to pay for all the services that every citizen utilizes such as police and fire services, waste pick up, street lighting, roald repairs, schools, etc.\nIt should be based on the cost of providing these services and charged to each citizen/household appropriately. Increases in this charge should only occur if new services are introduced or because of inflation. As a part of this reform much greater responsibility for the administration of this tax should be given back to local authorities.",
