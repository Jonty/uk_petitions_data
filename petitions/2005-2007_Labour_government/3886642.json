            "background": "Ministerial responsibilty is the idea that a department minister has responsibility for the departments actions. However, whenever anything goes wrong it often happens that the minister does not accept reposnisibility. The independence of the civil service needs to be reintroduced to ensure government workers are working in the best interests of a country and not a political party.",
