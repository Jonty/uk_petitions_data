            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Training doctors is not cheap, and it is taxpayers, via the NHS that pay for this. I have no problem with my taxes being spent in this wy; it's why we pay taxes. However I believe it is unfair and morally wrong for NHS trained medical staff to receive this NHS training, at no cost to themselves (other than course fees which are payable by all students)then give nothing back to the service which paid to train it, therefore leaving the NHS out of pocket and again lacking British-qualified staff. By making staff who defect from the NHS repay its training fees it will encourage staff to remain working for the NHS thus ensuring highly trained staff on its wards and in the community, or otherwise allow the NHS to train another person at no extra cost to the taxpayer.",
