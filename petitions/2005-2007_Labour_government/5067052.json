            "background": "Sky News has broadcast horrific images showing the barbaric cruelty that is going on NOW in Chinese Zoos in the name of entertainment.  LIVE animals are fed to other animals whilst bus loads of tourists laugh and cheer.  They can even pay for a cow to be hurled out of a van and torn apart.  Young bears are harnessed to cars and tormented into dragging the car along. All this whilst crowds of adults of children cheer! Every animal suffers. It is outrageous and has no place in a civilised society. Please add your name to this petition in the hope that we can put an end to this barbaric treatment of animals and their suffering. Animals should be respected and ENJOYED not tortured infront of paying crowds.",
