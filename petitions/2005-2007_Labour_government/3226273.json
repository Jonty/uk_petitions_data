            "background": "In many parts of Europe massive investment in Public Transport has created Low fares and frequent services so that the use of private cars is unnecessary. In my part of Staffordshire even with the aid of a over 60's bus pass I rarely use it as I have to walk over a mile to reach the nearest bus stop (which has no shelter) and services are to say the least unreliable. \nI therefore call on the Prime Minister and his government to improve public transport long before road pricing is even considered",
