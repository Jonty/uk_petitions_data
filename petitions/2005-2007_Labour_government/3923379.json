            "background": "Since the announcement of the forthcoming vacancy, fear and trepidation that the inclusion of certain celebrity wannabes as host will render the planned series of X Factor as unwatchable as American Idol, a previously fine example of commercial television. Given the obsession with gaining public support and finance to ensure the success of the programme, it is fair to suggest the public choose their prefered candidate and not be subjected to a 'done deal'.",
