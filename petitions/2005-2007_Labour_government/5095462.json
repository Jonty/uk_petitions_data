            "background": "Steven Patrick Morrissey (born May 22, 1959) is an English singer and songwriter of Irish descent from Manchester, England.\nHe rose to prominence in the 1980s as the vocalist of the English band The Smiths. When the band broke up in 1987, Morrissey began a successful solo career, racking up ten Top 10 singles in the UK.\n\nThe next Prime Minister of Britain looks set to be a dour and moody Scotsman. Im all for a Prime Minister to be more down to earth, but why not one who can sing?\n\nLets be honest, Morrissey would be a fantastic Prime Minister....\n\nSign this petition and to the nation proud.",
