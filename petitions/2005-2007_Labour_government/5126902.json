        "background": "People of 65 and over, most of whom are living on a reduced income but not reduced enough to claim benefits, should still not have to pay the same council tax as working people just because they have been prudent and have savings. This reduces their ability to have a minimum standard of living to which they are entitled having worked hard and contributed all their lives to this country.",
