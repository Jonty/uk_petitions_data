            "background": "So much of today's traffic is children going to school and people going to work.  We feel that it is the government's duty to set up a car sharing web site so that commuters and travellers can share journeys, be it regular ones to work or one off long journeys. We note from our own employees that many people travel from the same area, all in different cars.  Many people may find out that a neighbour accross the road works in the factory next door to their work. They could share a car and make a friend! The web site should also be able to cater for vans and trucks delivering to an area and returning empty.  If road signs carried an additional sign with this web site, it would also be a constant reminder to those commuters etc stuck in congestion.",
