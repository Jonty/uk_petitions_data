        "background": "Britain is an overcrowded country where finding peace and tranquility, away from the noise and threat of traffic is a growing challenge. \nWhile taking my two young children along a stretch of \"traffic free\" cycleway, busy with young families, on New Years day we came nose to nose with a convoy of recreational 4x4s.\nEnough of Britain's countryside has been given over to motor vehicle use. Too little is available for people, particularly those with young children, to enjoy without fear or harassment.\nWe call on the government to extend the restrictions to exclude motor vehicles from all classes of off-road rights of way, other than for access.",
