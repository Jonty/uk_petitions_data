            "background": "There is very good science to support the argument that a warming climate produces the higher CO2, not the reverse. Climate change is always happening; we are not in an unusual state of change. The government should be brave enough to commission a new study. Too many of the current conclusions come from computer models, their results can be manipulated to give any outcome wanted. Think again talk to unbiased scientists.",
