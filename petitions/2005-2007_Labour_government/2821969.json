            "background": "The general condition of some UK roads can present a major hazard to motorists/motorcyclists. The ill-judged placing of permanent road fixtures such as manhole covers, road banding and painted mini-roundabouts can create a hazardous situation to road users, in particular motorcyclists. With many other road safety measures such as variable speed limits and traffic calming measures, isn't it time that the roads themselves were made safer?",
