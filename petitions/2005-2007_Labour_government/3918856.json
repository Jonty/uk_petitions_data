Will he\n     recognise the vast sums of revenue raised from motorists every year that is not re invested in the roads.Please will he  pay far more heed to\n     the interests of the majority of motorists rather than the\n     minority environmental pressure groups who do not speak for the\n     majority of the population. Please will he promise to abandon plans to increase taxation of\n     motorists by any road pricing schemes and reduce fuel taxation\n     to a more sensible level.Public transport should be self\n     financing and not subsidised by motorists. The government should give motorists a fair deal and not tax them off the roads",
