        "background": "Members of the public attending cinema performances or buying DVDs should not have their time stolen by being forced to watch anti-piracy adverts before films at the cinema or on DVD.  People in cinemas are not watching a pirate film and have paid money not to have their time wasted. People watching a DVD may be watching a pirate copy, but if they are then the anti-piracy advert will probably have been edited out anyway, so it only affects legitimate purchasers.  Ban these waste of time adverts.",
