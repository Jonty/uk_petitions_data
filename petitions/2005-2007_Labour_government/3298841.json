A valid driving licence would suffice, or a version specifically for cyclists.  \nBy allowing someone without training in the highway code and road laws we present a potential hazard to legal road users.\nAlso if cyclists are to use roads they must recognise the danger and responsibility that comes with the territory and should have insurance to cover any accident or damage they may be unfortunate enough to experience.",
