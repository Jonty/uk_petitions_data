            "background": "The British film industry is full of potential. However, much of this industry is in the South East. The high cost of living discourages talent from moving there. It also takes large chunks out of British films' budgets, lowering the profitability of the industry, hence restricting its growth.  \n\nBirmingham is cheaper and more geographically accessible to much of the country, making it an ideal centre for British film. A taxpayer-funded studio, equal in stature to South Eastern locations such as Pinewood, would unlock the artistic potential of this heavily-populated area. \n\nFurthermore, many Hollywood productions now film in Australia or Canada due to escalating costs in California. Britain must do all she can to steal more of this market, and Birmingham is better placed than London to compete on cost-related grounds for Hollywood's resources.\n\nCinema has been America's cultural voice to the world for a century. It can be ours too. We owe our industry this chance.",
