            "background": "We support the logical extension of the New Labour Project in the UK to become the New Marxist Project for the planet. Marx meant 'From each according to his ability; to each according to their need'. To us this means be honest with youself about your own level of ability. Respect and appreciate those with greater gifts. Look after those less fortunate than yourself. In practice, this means \"I'll look after me and mine; you look after you and yours\". With near perfect information and communication we have near perfect markets. Nobody believes Gates, Abramovic and footballers are worth so much. The value of money has been devalued. Let's reform the capital markets so that individuals and corporate bodies expect and target to earn 20% Gross Profit; pay 10% tax and retain 10% net profit. Make the companies buy back all of their shares and become respectable corporate citizens.\n\nThis would be a lasting legacy.",
