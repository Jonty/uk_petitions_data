            "background": "Commercial kitchens are major consumers of energy and emit over 18 million tonnes of Carbon Dioxide due to the energy sapping products they have 'back of house.'  However, simply by specifying more efficient equipment substantial reductions in both energy use and Carbon Dioxide emissions can be achieved. \n\nChanges to regulation are slow to appear as Government do not understand what regulations are required.  We believe the time has come to introduce new rules governing the foodservice industry.  \n\nMinimum efficiency levels for ALL commercial prime cooking and refrigeration equipment must be increased and current regulation amended to ensure these changes are adopted by the foodservice industry.",
