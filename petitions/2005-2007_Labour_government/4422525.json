It is time for us to ACT and make them regret what they have done because had we made them regret the last abduction of UK soldiers, they wouldn't have tried their luck this time round.\n\nSuch a military strike against Iran should include targets like \n\nA) Nuclear installations.\nB) Petrolium refinaries\nC) Bridges\nD) Government buildings\n\nusing cruise missles at times of the day/night where minimal casualties are inflicted on the Iranians.\n\nREGARDLESS of whether the Iranians hand over our people or not - they must be made to regret what they have done.",
