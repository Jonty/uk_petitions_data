            "background": "The teaching of foreign languages in English schools is the poor relation to the teaching of maths, English and science.  The teaching of foreign languages should be given much more importance, for both good cultural and commercial reasons.  \n\nWhen compared to other European countries, modern languages are taught very poorly in England.  For example, most German students tend to be proficient in English.  Compare this with the majority of our students who lack the most basic conversational skills in any foreign language.",
