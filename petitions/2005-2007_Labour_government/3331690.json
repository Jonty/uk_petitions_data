            "background": "Halloween originated in Great Britain and Ireland but people mistake it for originating in the U.S. So halloween is part of our culture and history we should be celebrating it more. I want a week-long break from school for Halloween for British kids, this is already done in Ireland and has been a success. The goverment is pro for more school breaks, well heres the answer and kids will love it. It may help calm down the trouble surrounded round halloween sometimes with teenagers so they will have time to do other things than cause trouble.",
