            "background": "In light of the obvious watering down of 'Sarah's Law' and the disinclination to inform parents of the existence of a threat to their Children and disclose the identity and whereabouts of this threat, to set up a dedicated unit to properly and continuously monitor the whereabouts and activities of convicted Paedophiles and Child abusers to prevent their reoffending. The present fragmented and misleading system of entrusting this vital function to the Probation service, Police and Social Services clearly fails on far too many occasions due to lack of a cohesive approach and the inability of these individual organisations to share information or realistically assess levels of risk.",
