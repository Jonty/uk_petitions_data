            "background": "The increasing and widespread use of Private Security Contractors (PSCs), especially since UK, US and other Armed Forces personnel are present in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\nPaul Bremer provided immunity from prosecution to Contractors from Iraqi Jurisdiction one day before the dissolution of the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA), an extension to Order 17, granting personnel and contractors immunity from prosecution by the Iraq Government making it impossible for future Iraqi governments to prosecute PSCs. \n \nThis is important due to the fact that most of the PSCs have been involved in unauthorised incidents that includes the illegal killing of innocent Iraqis and Afghan Nationals, destruction of properties, untrained personnel employed to carry and use of lethal weapons.\n\nWhile UK and US Forces are providing security, the use of PSCs is illegal and a clear violation of International Laws.",
