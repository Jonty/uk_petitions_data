            "background": "The TSO provides excellent resoruces for the nations' schools and colleges on the National Curriculum - but they are expensive. I hereby call upon the British government and specifically the Dept of Education to encourage the TSO bookshop to make their reports available as downloadable documents rather than only in hard copy - particularly in core areas like maths, english and science. The purpose of this is :\n\n1. To expand access to educational reosurces\n2. To enhance teaching standards and improve learning in keeping with the original aims of the National Curriculum \n3. To widen access and equality of opportunity not only for those schools and teachers able to pay \n4. To improve access to information in accordance with the government's commitment to \"education, education, education !\" \n5. Possibly even enabling schools and colleges to expand the number of subjects and courses taught with a beneficial snowball effect on professional development and the economy",
