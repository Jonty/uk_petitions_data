This practice is extremely cruel and the EUs proposals for the use of so called 'Enhanced' cages by 2012 is not sufficient to quell the suffering of these poor animals.\nPlease ban the production of eggs from all Caged Hens/Battery Chickens in the UK so as to encourage the use of free-range hens in the British farming industry and ban the sale of eggs from Caged Hens/Battery Chickens in the UK to ensure that our farming Industry & markets are not overrun by less humane producers from abroad.",
