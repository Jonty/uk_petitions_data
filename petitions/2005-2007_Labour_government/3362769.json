            "background": "Basically, after speaking with some other BMX riders and skateboarders at the skatepark on Vansitart Road in Windsor, there appears to be support for the idea of getting some dirt jumps built on a part of the field near the skatepark for the BMX and other bike riders to use. It would bring more people to the area, which would be beneficial for local shop owners.  It would also be possible to add a dirt section to the competition that happens in the summer, which would also be instrumental in drawing other riders, as well as spectators, into the town.",
