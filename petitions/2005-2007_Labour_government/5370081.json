            "background": "Cats cause more damage to property - such as gardens and parks, and spread more disease than rats by leaving their excrement in children's play areas and other public places. The most any member of the public can do to protect their property or heath is to squirt water at them. Cat owners can not be held liable for the problems their animals cause. \n\nThe public should be allowed to prevent cats from causing damage to their property and protect their children's health by using the same means as they would with rats.",
