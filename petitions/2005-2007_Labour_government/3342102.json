With the 2012 Olympics not too far off, and the lack of things for today's youth to do, this would help keep teenagers off the street.  It would also encourage children to exercise in a fun way (you don't see too many fat ice skaters!).  \n\nPlease make Tony Blair and his Government listen by signing this petition and demanding an ice skating rink be built within 20 minutes of every town.\n\nThank You",
