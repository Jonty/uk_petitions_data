            "background": "AFC Wimbledon have been deducted 18 points in the Ryman premier league for not registering a `foriegn` player. He was registered but just not as a `foriegn` player and as he comes from WALES you could understand the mistake. Come on they are a new club formed by fans from the old Wimbledon FC and so don`t know how to dot the i`s and dot the t`s and someone did`t know WALES was a foreign country in football terms. Even though i`m not a fan you should do the decent thing Tone and let them have the 18 points back. They have already been thrown out of the FA vase Trophy. Theve been punished enough. If you love footy help them out please. TA",
