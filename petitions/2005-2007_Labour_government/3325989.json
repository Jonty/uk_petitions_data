        "background": "I think that Dave Steele of the magnificent parish of Rainhill should be made our next King of this country with ever decreasing moral values. He has assured me he will help the elderly (spend their money), help the young (spend their money), hopefully inflating his own bank balance at the same time (just like the other politicians). In addition to this he promises free ice cream for everybody, including the elderly but they will have to pay a nominal amount to cover administration costs. A three day week would be mandatory, except for the elderly who would be made to queue at closed down post offices to enable everybody else to get near the open ones. There is the usual promise about tax etc, but it would all be lies so we should get that straight out of the way. Vote now",
