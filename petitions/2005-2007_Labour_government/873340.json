The cause of conjestion on motorways is the direct result of a lorries pulling out in front of smooth flowing traffic resulting in a back log of traffic waiting to pull into lane 3. This might not sound like too much of a pain if it is only one lorry, put if there are three 0r four  trying to overtake it restricts the flow of two lanes to 56 mph at crutial times.",
