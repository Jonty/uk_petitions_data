Deaths like that of Kodjo Yenga in Broad Daylight in the Hammersmith area are so upsetting and I feel for his family,bless them. No more deaths on the streets, we need more protection. The youths involved were as young as 13, something needs to be done.Also make sure the police on the street are adequately protected too against these groups.",
