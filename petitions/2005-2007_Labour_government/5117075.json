            "background": "Would the prime minister please intervene with the application to live in the UK by one of it's military Heroes. Which has been refused by his governmental departments. (Working in his name).\n\nMr Pun earned his VC in Burma on June 23, 1944, whilst serving with 6th Gurkha Rifles. After almost all his comrades were wiped out. He seized a Bren Gun and, firing from the hip and running through ankle-deep mud, he ignored Japanese fire to storm machine gun positions. \n\nHis official citation read: \"His outstanding courage and superb gallantry in the face of odds which meant almost certain death were most inspiring and beyond praise.\" \n\nHe was invited to the Queen's Coronation and had tea with the Queen Mother.\n\nYet, despite his illustrious record, his application to live in Britain has been refused. \n\nThe old soldier was told: \"You have failed to demonstrate that you have strong ties with the UK.\" \n\nWhat greater ties to a country do you need than to be awarded it's highest award \"FOR VALOUR\", whilst fighting for it's cause.\n\nPlease review and overturn this shamefull decision.",
