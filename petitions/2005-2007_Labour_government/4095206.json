            "background": "Too many people are committing serious crimes too young, a woman in her early 20s was hospitalized by a seven year old with a knife, at any age, people know what damage knifes and other weapons can do, and are all to quick to do things like this and get away with it, then for the situation to deteriate into adulthood, if someone was to start murdering as a child, they could go on to become a mass-murderer and as a community we would have sat back and watched. It is disgusting. Police should be able to arrest people for serious things at a younger age",
