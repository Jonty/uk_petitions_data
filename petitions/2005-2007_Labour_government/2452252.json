Let us see Ministers who tell lies in what they promise the voters, and fail to deliver, given only 25% of their Salaries!  And let the Government make the Minister in charge of the Benefits Agency actually LIVE ON the amount given to a comparable Family for a whole year of their jobs, so they can see what they are forcing on other people!\n  If you agree with this, why not sign up right now, and lets see what Mr. Blair thinks about that!",
