I'll tell you one thing, it certainly doesn't sum up my sentiments about Great Britain. \n\nThe perfect alternative in my eyes is \"Return of the Mack\" - a haunting and poignant song which will stir the patriotic mucus of even the most cynical British citizen. How can you fail to be moved by lyrics such as the following...\n\n\"(You lied to me) all those times I said that I love you\n(You lied to me) yes, I tried, yes, I tried\n(You lied to me) even though you know I'd die for you\n(You lied to me) yes, I cried, yes, I cried\"\n\n\"Pump up the world\" bleats Mark Morrison, can't you just imagine standing up, putting your hand on your heart and belting that out at the top of your voice. I know I can.",
