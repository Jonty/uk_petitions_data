            "background": "The Church of England has succeeded in reactivating a medieval law stating that ownership of a piece of farmland makes a married couple personally responsible for hundreds of thousands of pounds worth of repair to the local church chancel, not to mention 17 years of legal costs, which will leave them with a bill of around \u00a31/2 million. \n\nThe Act has been widely criticised as unfair and the Law Society of England and Wales has called for it to be abolished.",
