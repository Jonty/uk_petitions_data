As more extreme and right invading laws are passed, we, the people have no way of being heard, and unless this is resolved, these, your people may have no choice but to start looking to more extreme ways of being heard.\nThis petition is to ask Gordon Brown, or whom ever may take power after him to change that, and start listening to the people.",
