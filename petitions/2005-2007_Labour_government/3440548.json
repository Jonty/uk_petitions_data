            "background": "To bring back execution to those who take lives and ruin lives such as murderers, police killers, paedophiles and repeat offenders such as rapists. This will decrease overcrowding in prisons (and reoffending!!). With DNA and other forensic measures available to prove guilt beyond any doubt, there is no room for mistaken identity and error as there was before. Those who commit these grave offences against humanity give up any right to be  included in society.  Why do we continue to support the human rights of killers, paedophiles and rapists?? What about the rights of the victims and their families??  Justice in this country is now a complete joke.",
