        "background": "It is clear that the present system of elected 'representative' government is not meeting the needs of the public. Politicians are not trusted and, once elected, not accountable, except to each other. Elections simply guarantee that power is placed in the hands of the very people who should be denied power at all costs. Therefore, we must stop holding elections of all kinds and immediately return to a system of absolute monarchy. This system would be permanent, hereditary and presided over by the House of Windsor.",
