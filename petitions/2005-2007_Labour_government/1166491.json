            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At the moment there is barely any tax on short haul flights in the UK so they are often cheaper than the train or public transport equivelant.\n\nOn average a journey by plane produces 3 times more Greenhouse gas than the same  journey taken by train. \n\nIncreasing the charging on short haul flights and improving the reliability and price of the train network would dramatically reduce the need for new airports/airport expansion while reducing carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emmissions dramatically.\n\nIt would also inspire engineers in the UK to re-focus new design on speeding up trains instead of planes. While securing jobs on the train network.\n\nSo this is a petition for those wishing to improve the train service of the UK and/or reduce the number of short haul flights.",
