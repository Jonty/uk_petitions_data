            "background": "It should be illegal for banks and other lending institutions to advertise credit cards and lending products on any form of media. The product labelled 'Credit' is actually debt and is the cause of a great deal of unhappiness in society and regularly causes people to take their own lives. Just as there is a ban on all tobacco advertising because of tobacco's harmful effects, the same law should apply to credit and lending advertising.",
