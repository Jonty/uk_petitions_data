Also 2nd Class Postage was \u00a32.25, even though the Price of 2nd Class Postage up to 100g is 23p!\n\nIf a Ticket is advertised at \u00a350, then that is the price you should pay.\n\nThis is Simple greed by Ticket Agencies, who already make a massive profit through the value of the Ticket alone.",
