            "background": "When any serviceman dies it is a tragedy; particularly when the death was preventable or related to ineffective equipment, imposed by budgetary constraints.\nAnyone would expect that the MoD would be tripping over its own feet to ensure that a person of such honour - who died in its service - received the funeral he deserved.\nYet there has been a recent example of the MoD lacking even the merest modicum of respect in its campaign to stab its own men in the back through fiscal frugality. The RAF is refusing to pay the entire cost of a certain man's funeral, who died in action in Iraq, leaving his family with a \u00a31000 bill. They claim that, \"The cost of flowers and a wake are regarded by the MoD as personal expressions of sympathy and cannot be paid for by public funds.\"\nSuch wanton insult, disrespect and indignity towards any man who dies serving the people of this nation should never be tolerated by any organ within the government, and is disgraceful in the highest regard.",
