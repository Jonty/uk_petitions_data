            "background": "There are many petitions to the PM concerning knighthoods for different people, and you may wonder what makes this one any different. The purpose of the knighthood is to recognise people who are an beacon of what citizens should aspire to, to recognise the best of the best. Whilst not as much in the public domain as some sporting or entertainment stars, Steve Chalke\u2019s tireless mission to make this world a better place is an inspiration to all. Steve is an inspired Christian leader, preacher, broadcaster, author and campaigner. He was awarded an MBE in 2004 for services to inclusion, but since then has continued to work tirelessly to serve society in the name of Jesus, and strongly deserves proper recognition for this from the country. He is the driving force behind the Oasis Trust, Faithworks and most recently Stop the Traffik, a global coalition to stop people trafficking. In 2005 he raised \u00a31.25m for the Oasis charities running the London Marathon and aims to raise \u00a32m+ in 2007.",
