            "background": "most foreign companies send trucks into the u k, delivering vital goods, but paying nothing towards the upkeep of the road network. They pay no road fund license & most fuel up in mainland europe therefore not even contributing towards our tax system or maintainance of the road network at all. This means they can undercut our haulage costs putting British jobs at risk, especially if road toll charging comes in widening the gap further. A system of taxation could be included at the point of entry depending on length of stay.",
