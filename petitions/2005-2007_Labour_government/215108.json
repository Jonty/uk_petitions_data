        "background": "The Christian majority in this country is often indirectly discriminated against by those in authority who deem Christian celebrations \"offensive\". However in a room of over 1000 people from numerous ethnic backgrounds on Monday 4th December at a AS/A2 Politics conference in London, not one person was offended by the concept or public celebration of Christmas. So why do those few in authority want to appear as \"politically correct\" when all they really do is cause more racial tension. Action needs to be taken against this as it is only a very small minority who is offended by Christmas, any holiday of any faith in a multicultural society should be celebrated openly.",
