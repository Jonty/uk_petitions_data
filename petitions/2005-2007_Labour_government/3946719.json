            "background": "Starting with existing speed cameras in existing variable-speed sections of motorway, use cameras to implement cheap per-junction motorway congestion charging, with tolls payable by phone or at some petrol stations, and revenue used to convert hard shoulder to peak-time extra lane. Possibly extend to some toll roads, bridges, tunnels and dual carriageways, converting these to high efficiency lighting and implementing other general transport improvements.",
