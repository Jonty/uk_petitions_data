        "background": "Many of the petitions here on the 10 Downing Street Website propose Common Sense changes to legislation, or the introduction of legislation which is grounded in good, old-fashioned Common Sense, something which seems to be missing from so much current and proposed legislation. In addition, much legislation is out-of-date and updates could also be submitted. Please sign this petition if you would like to see an expansion of this Public-Government interface to include an area where Joe Public can submit such ideas and amendments to the government. Such ideas could be distributed out to the relevant government department for consideration and, if nothing else, give those departments more of an idea as to public opinion.",
