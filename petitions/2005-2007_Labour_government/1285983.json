        "background": "Asperger Syndrome is a form of autism, a disability that affects the way a person communicates and relates to others.This may include: difficulty in communicating, difficulty in social relationships, limitation of imagination.People with Asperger Syndrome are often of average or above average intelligence.Because their disability is less obvious than that of someone with autism, a person with Asperger Syndrome is, in a sense, more vulnerable.As they get older they may realize that they are different from other people and feel isolated and depressed.People with Asperger Syndrome often want to be sociable and are upset by the fact that they find it hard to make friends.Statistics show that approx 91 per 10,000 people have an Autistic Spectrum Condition and of these approx 36% will have Asperger Syndrome.Such people have much to contribute to society, yet unemployment can run at up to 96% of affected people",
