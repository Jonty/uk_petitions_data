            "background": "Ever since the government turned the power of road tolling and parking over to local councils for revenue collection the local councils have seen this as a great way to levy additional funding on such schemes as the yellow box junction traps and eye in the sky spying. No council is worse at this than Camden who have frankly abused the privelage and Westminster who are stealthily about to introduce payed parking on motorbikes in the area. With control returning to government, or a centralised body, consistency and centralisation can better govern what has frankly become a joke and a mess, with drivers getting regularly penalised unjustly, often through simple confusion and inconsistency in signage and controls.",
