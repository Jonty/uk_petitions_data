        "background": "I am writing to object to plans for congestion charging in Manchester.How are we supposed to find the extra funding just to do our jobs which we already pay taxes on. To pay another tax just to get there. Also why should I as a car driver have to pay towards public transport. It the public want it, then increase the fares and let the people who use it pay for it. Give us a referendum, politicians are supposed to be our voices, but they never stop talking long enough to listen.",
