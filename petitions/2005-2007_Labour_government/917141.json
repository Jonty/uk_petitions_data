            "action": "introduce legislation to allow wives who choose to stay at home to bring up their children & make a home, to be able to transfer their personal tax allowance to their husband for as long as they elect to do so.",

            "background": "The lack of state support for the natural family of husband, wife, and children, has resulted in countrywide social breakdown.   Gaols are full of the results of this disastrous policy which has been followed by successive governments.   Allowing wives to transfer their tax allowance when they have children would begin to redress this situation by strengthening & underpinning a partnership which is the bedrock of any stable and law abiding society.",
