            "background": "This will allow our country to both maximise our potential labour force and help reduce the unemplyed. At the moment the only help a person who is unemployed gets is when they have been unemployed for 6 months and that help is very very limited, and the training courses that are available worthless.\nA person who is then trained can have no excuses for being unemployed if he or she has the skills for a job type that is in high demand and crying out for skilled people.\n\nHelp make our country a world leader again instead of one filled with unskilled, deadend job workers or unemployable workshy people.\nSign this petition today.",
