            "background": "It is utterly ridiculous that shops are open on Boxing Day. Who really needs to go and buy a computer/3-piece suite/flooring etc on that day? TV commercials up to and including Christmas Day exhorted us to leave behind the family home (where Christmas should be and traditionally has been) spent to queue for 9am shop-opening!\n\nI have in mind particularly also the shop staff, who already have to work anti-social hours throughout the year and then face the prospect of being back at work on (usually) the 26 December. Give them a rest.\n\nI have selected the 3000 sq ft demarcation since that is the size of shop which is regulated by existing Sunday Trading legislation and not allowed to open on Easter Sunday.",
