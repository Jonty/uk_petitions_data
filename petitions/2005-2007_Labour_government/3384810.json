It is therefore our duty, as a nation and as fellow humans, to see that those without hope are given a chance to regain their dignity and rejoin the larger community.\n\nWe formally request that greater aid is given to those shelters in helping the homeless help themselves, and also to help in setting up new homeless shelters where they are needed.\n\nWe also request tax benefits (if such a system does not already exist) for companies that donate unneeded food, clothes and other needed services in the aid of shelters.",
