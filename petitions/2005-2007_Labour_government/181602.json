        "action": "encourage and facilitate local government and police to introduce traffic calming measures against the dangers arising from huge lorries using our narrow streets.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The residents of Hatfield Broad Oak and other Essex villages are being endangered by large articulated lorries and other inappropriate traffic speeding through their narrow streets in order to avoid congestion on the M11, A120 and other major roads around Stansted airport. High levels of traffic especially of heavy lorries through our village compromise pedestrian safety, place our children at risk,  cause congestion on our streets, damage to listed buildings, high traffic noise and poor air quality, resulting in the diminution of the quality of life for residents.\n\nWe desperately need traffic calming measures to prevent drivers acting with impunity. We call upon the government to actively encourage the further extension of speed limits and other traffic calming measures. This would make our narrow streets safer and contribute to the government's environmental aspirations by slowing heavy vehicles.",
