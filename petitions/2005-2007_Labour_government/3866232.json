            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Current government policy wholeheartedly supports depriving people of their back gardens to create large quantities of high density \"rabbit hutch\" housing, whether the land owners and surrounding residents want it or not. Also, badgers, bats, newts etc that reside on the land get removed. Councils (in particular Colchester Council) take no notice of these features or of residents concerns, and gloss over them in the report to the planning committee. I want this undemocratic, unenvironmental and disastrous policy rectified before there are no urban green spaces or wildlife left.",
