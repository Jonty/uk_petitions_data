            "background": "I was having a conversation with a friend the other day over the advice that nutritionalists give that we should all eat at least 5 fruit a day, and how most students may never reach this amount. \n\nI know for a fact that vast numbers of students will hardly ever consume this amount of fruit in one day. This is due to it being less publicised than other snack food (crisps, fizzy drinks etc.), which is where a students money ends up going.\n\nMy request is that fruit should be provided for free for students in Education, or those individuals that are on benefits. \n\nThe health benefits of such a decision would be astromical. A large quantity of health care cost goes into individuals who have not eaten the correct level of nutrients. This could be counteracted in future generations by ensuring our current generation is properly nourished. This would amount to huge cost savings for the future health service, and a far healthier society in general.\n\nThanks for listening.\nDavid Lee",
