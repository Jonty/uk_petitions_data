            "background": "Legislate for and fund a water resources transfer scheme, similar to the one proposed and costed by the Institute of Civil Engineers, in order that the drought prone southern areas of the country never have to face domestic, agricultural and industrial water shortages again. It should not be left to the discretion of the water companies, as this should be a national infrastructure policy and is of national importance and it is the duty of the Government to determine, manage and enable solutions to such serious issues. The existing problem is only going to get worse in the long run, both from local population increase and global warming.",
