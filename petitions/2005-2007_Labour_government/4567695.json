            "background": "With the recent announcement of the South Downs becoming a National Park, we believe the North Downs should also have the same requirement. This is because of the pressure on the south-east especially the Kent area and particularly the housing growth to build on this land.\n\nThe Kent part known as the Kent Downs is a Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty but this is not stopping the planned expansion to triple the size of Ashford, build on it and build houses on floodplains in this area. The increased growth including the idea of widening the M25 is causing concerns for environmentalists and as this is the first part of Britain people see from the ports and some main airports we want to protect whats left for the future.",
