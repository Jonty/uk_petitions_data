        "background": "The Home Office deports DR-Congo \"refused\" asylum seekers despite evidence indicating that they may face imprisonment and torture on return.\nAn Immigration Appeal Tribunal case on the 7th March 2007 will challenge the current DR Congo Country Guidance in which the Home Office claims there is no risk on return to \"refused\" asylum seekers.\nEven if a deportee had no history of persecution in the DRC, they may be branded a political dissident simply because they claimed asylum in Europe, and as such, could face imprisonment and torture on return. The DRC authorities know which passengers are deportees because a UK officer personally hands them over in the airport .\nALL DRC deportees are in danger because they risk being interrogated at the airport to see if there is a political \"charge\" against them, or just to extort a \"fine\".",
