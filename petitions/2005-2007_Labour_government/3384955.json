Rather than road pricing let's look at road discounting.  E.G.  If you ride your bike to work everyday the government will discount you road tax by a set amount yearly.  This can  be regulated by an easy registration scheme with your employer.  The more people that ride to his work the less tax he pays.  These are fundamentally sound ideas what do you think?",
