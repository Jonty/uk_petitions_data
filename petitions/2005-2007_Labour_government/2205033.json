            "background": "A round-robin email has excited much interest in the petition to scrap the alleged road pricing car tax.\n\nThe email contains several inaccuracies and wild, unsubstantiated claims and was designed to get people to sign a petition without thinking. (And it was very successful at doing so).\n\nVehicle taxation is here to stay - whether we like it or not. That is not the issue here. The issue is whether Government policy should be decided on many gullible people being scared into signing a petition by an email containing many untruths.\n\nThe email claims, inter alia, \"The tracking device will cost about \u00a3200 and in a recent study by the BBC,\nthe lowest monthly bill was \u00a328 for a rural florist and \u00a3194 for a delivery\ndriver. A non working mother who used the car to take the kids to school\npaid \u00a386 in one month.\" Has anyone asked the BBC when they carried out this study?",
