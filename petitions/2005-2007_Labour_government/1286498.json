            "background": "Replacing the Trident missile system with Sharks with laser beams attached to their heads to have many benefits for the defence of the UK.\n\nSharks cost very little and can even self replicate thereby reducing future defence spending.\n\nThe planet is 70% water; sharks with laser beams attached to their heads will be able to strike at every major coastal city in the world.\n\nTheir teeth will make great melee weapons. They will not need costly bayonets.\n\nDue to the meaty construction of a shark, at the end of its lifespan, the weapon will naturally decompose without pollution. Being entirely natural, it is also carbon neutral and so will be an acceptable choice for greens and other tree hugging hippies.\n\nThe psychological effect of this new weapon will strike fear into the hearts of terrorists and Scottish Nationalists.",
