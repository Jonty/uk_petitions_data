As per the EU WEEE Directive this also ensures that re-use is given priority\nand ensure that dumping of computers in Africa is avoided and the public sector can set the right example for others to follow.\n\nI work for Maxitech a Not-For-Profit social enterprise and we turn the problem of old computers from large organisations into opportunities and resources for the local disadvantaged communities in UK for example young unemployed people getting experince in the process leading to jobs. \n\nHaving recently launched a new initiative with older people\ncharity and some london key stakeholders which has already\nsupplied free computers to older people drop in day centers\nacross the capital preventing digital and social exclusions.\n\nHowever we have a shortage of computers as the demand is outstripping supply.",
