            "background": "We are campaigning to ensure the members of the British forces are given the care and expert treatment they need when injured in action or from the physcological damage they may incur on tours. They deserve and need the proper medical treatment required to deal with the physical and mental trauma that they sustain in the line of duty. This should also extend to those who have been discharged but are still in need of care.\nThese brave men and women put their lives on the line evey day for this country and they should receive the best care available, which in our opinion is private healthcare given by people experienced in dealing with the military and injuries sustained within it.",
