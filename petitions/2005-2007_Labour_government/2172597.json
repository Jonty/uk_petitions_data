It is insensitive to survivors of rape and its use of 'celebrity' jurors, one of whom is notorious for violence against women, is tacky sensationalism of the worst kind.  The Government should be spending this money on trying to keep struggling Rape Crisis centres open, not pouring Champagne down Lord Archer's throat.",
