            "background": "It has been anounced that the government wants to raise the age for buying cigarettes to 18 and alcohol to 21, i believe the law that is in place now for these things is fair and resonable which has been around for many years and should not be changed, unless the government can give more positives then negative reasons for doing so. Therefore i think it should stay the way it is and has been.",
