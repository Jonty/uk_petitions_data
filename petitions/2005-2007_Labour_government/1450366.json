            "background": "traffic jams on dual-carriageway roads filtering down to 1 lane are caused by :\na) cars in the outside lane stopping far before the merge point with their left indicator on, effectively reducing the length of the road on which to store traffic \nand b) drivers on the inside lane believing that cars on the outside lane attempting to merge in are somehow deeply in the wrong, moving forwards to block them off, and causing both lanes of traffic to suddenly slam their brakes on and come to halt. Add volume of traffic to this behaviour, and you have a predictable, infuriating and totally unnecessary jam.\nMedia campaigns teach kids how to cross the roads and so on, but there is nothing to teach supposedly qualified drivers how to help prevent traffic jams.",
