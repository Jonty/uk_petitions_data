            "action": "Ban use of the term 'Nuclear Power' from all governmental literature, speeches and press releases.  Replace the term with 'Nuclear Fission Power' so as not to undermine the benefits of developing a Nuclear Fusion Power Plant.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The term 'Nuclear Power' has long been synonymous with nuclear fission technology; a technology which all current nuclear power plants employ.  The downside of nuclear fission is well documented.  The use of this term undermines the huge advantages of developing Nuclear Fusion power plants:\n\nFusion is an almost limitless fuel supply.\n\nFusion produces no greenhouse gas emissions. Fusion does not generate carbon dioxide which causes global warming, nor does it produce any other waste gases.\n\nA single fusion power station could generate electricity for two million households.\n\nFusion is not a chain reaction and is therefore inherently safe and can never run out of hand. If the chamber were to become damaged the reaction would simply stop.\n\nWaste from fusion will not be a long-term burden on future generations.  Any radioactive waste generated will be small in volume and the radioactivity will decay over several decades \u2013 not millions of years as with Fission power.",
