        "background": "Fossil-fueled private motor vehicles are largely unneccessary, anti-social, create economic inefficiency and contribute greatly to global warming. Government must oversee the process of progressively phasing them out and replacing them with an energy-efficient public transport system. It is morally obliged to frame the message such that its electorate can understand. Climate change denial should be made a criminal offence.",
