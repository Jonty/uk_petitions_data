            "background": "The SNP want a referendum on Scottish Independence. However, this referendum may not be straight way. The government should not give any further defence orders to Scotland until the issue of Scottish Independence is completed. It would be wrong for a Scottish shipyard or company to get an order whilst part of the UK, but later to have independence. This would mean English/ Welsh taxpayers would be paying for a foreign shipyard whilst their own shipyards are closing down.",
