            "background": "The radio-frequency spectrum is a national resource the distribution of which is a natural monopoly. The size of the usable spectrum is finite. To ensure efficient use of the spectrum, all of it should be leased, in chunks, to the highest bidders. In particular, no allowance should be made for police, armed forces and other such users - they should bid for what they require (with additional government funds if necessary) and release what they don't require for more efficient use by others.",
