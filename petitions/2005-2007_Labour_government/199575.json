        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Imperial War Museum is displaying a Holocaust Exhibition which we support for humanitarian reasons. However, we are resolutely against a portion of the exhibition where alleged Armenian genocide is mentioned! This alleged genocide has not taken place at all whereas a civil war between Turks and Armenians, in 1915, has. 521,000 Turks have died in the conflict and approx  600,000 Armenians lost their lives, where Ottoman Armenians had sided with the invading Russian armies. This is termed 'high treason'. British Government does not accept alleged Armenian genocide taken place, neither the United Nations nor the International Court of Human Rights in Hague. So, how is it that a reputable establishment like the Imperial War Museum goes against the historical truth? We are protesting their stand in no uncertain terms.",
