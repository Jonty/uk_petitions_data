            "background": "Every year the National Front, march through Bermondsey and deliberately incite and stir up racism.  This year the march is due to take place on the 21st April.  By the time this petition is authorised the march may have gone ahead, however this petition is for all racist marches.  It seems that freedom of speech has overshadowed the human rights of those who want to live in a peaceful society.  Police have even advised black business owners to close their businesses on the day of the march for fear of reprisals.  The human rights of those who attend these marches are respected but what about those of the business owners who lose money, and the residents and visitors to the area, who feel intimidated?  What about the human rights of those of ethnic minorities who have contributed to british society?  This is like a slap in the face.  The human rights of a few are prioritised above those of the many.  In addition these marches cost tax payers' money.  I and all who sign this petition stand against the spirit of racism and these marches and demand that they be banned.",
