YOU JUST CANNOT GET THROUGH! You just get cut off!!  Why is it surprising that so many 'citizens'  go out and steal to feed their habits etc!  This is not the case re my friend who genuinely required a loan. It's all very good and well to say that you want OUR opinion and the fact that you have 'specially trained staff ready to deal with social fund enqs' when they don't flipping answer the phone!  You want to use Crystal Mark (approved by the Plain English Campaign', why don't you listen to plain English?? (ref no: CHANNEL.BDCROLL3/B50)",
