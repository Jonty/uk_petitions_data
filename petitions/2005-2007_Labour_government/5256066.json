            "background": "Waltham Forest College has decided to close its swimming pool due to lack of funds and as you would have seen in the press, there are clubs, schools and the general public (young and old) that would miss this immensely. Our children have swimming lessons there and with the government suggesting that obesity in children is rising and they need more exercise, I would ask you to please intervene to stop this pool being closed down.\n\nThank you for your support",
