            "background": "The government continues to press on with the introduction of ID cards despite widespread public concerns. The introduction of ID cards will not prevent terrorism or crime. \n\nThe National Data Register will create a very large data pool in one place that could be an enhanced risk in case of unauthorized accesses, hacking or malfunctions.\n\nIt is claimed that the new ID card & passport will cost \u00a393, but spiralling cost could see this rise significantly. Compliance with the terms of the ID cards Bill will mean even small firms are likely to have to pay \u00a3250 for smartcard readers and other requirements will add to the administrative burdens firms face.",
