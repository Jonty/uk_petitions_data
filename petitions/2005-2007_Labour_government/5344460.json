Knowing, as they supposed, what beliefs would make men virtuous, they invented arguments, often very sophistical to prove that these are true\". Bertrand Russell.\nOur teachers, students, and educational organizations are getting seriously 'bogged down' with a form of modern sophistry. Sometimes this is incredibly well meaning, but it should be kept outside the educational environment, excepting for purely comparative purposes. \nOur schools are not the place for the indoctrination of any particular ideology or the making of serious commitments. Strength of conviction, especially in our young people, is not necessarily a gauge of any present reality or will be any part of their own future reality. Untold damage may already have been done, which is shown up by some fierce reactions, coming from a lack of some discernment and a natural, easily nurtured (evilly by a very few) vulnerability and gullibility.",
