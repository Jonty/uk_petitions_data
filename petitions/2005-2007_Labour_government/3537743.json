Although it's a burden for the seller and they are faced with paying stamp duty on their next purchase as well, they have an option of adding the Duty to their sale price. Therefore the FTB can pay the Duty over a longer term on the mortgage. Or they could opt to pay a lump sum to avoid added interest.",
