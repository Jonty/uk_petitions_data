        "background": "HE Government was on a collision course with nurses and other health workers last night after deciding to award them a staged pay rise below the rate of inflation, while giving the armed forces the highest increase in the public sector.\n\nA 2.5% increase for health staff will be paid in two stages in April and November, effectively worth less than 2% a year, while rises of between 3.3% and 9.2% for servicemen and women will be paid \"without delay\".\n\nUnion leaders described the announcement as a \"kick in the teeth\" for NHS staff and raised the threat of industrial action.",
