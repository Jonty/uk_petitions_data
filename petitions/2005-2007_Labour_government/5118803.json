        "background": "Mr. Tul Bahadur Pun, who won the Victoria Cross fighting for Britain is 84 and in poor health. Astonishingly he has been banned from coming to live in the UK - because he has \"failed to demonstrate strong ties with the UK\" (fighting for Britain is clearly not enough).  Mr. Pun won our highest bravery medal in the Second World War and wants to spend his last days among old comrades and having treatment for several health problems.\nHe was handed his VC by Lord Mountbatten in 1944 for single-handedly charging a Japanese position in Burma under heavy fire.\nHe now lives in a hut with no proper roof, running water or sanitation in a village 16,000ft up in the Himalayas.  He has diabetes, high blood pressure, heart problems and asthma. His eyesight is poor and he has hearing trouble. \nThis brave man should be granted leave to stay in the UK now!",
