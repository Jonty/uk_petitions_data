            "background": "It is a betrayal of the people of the UK for the Justice Ministry and the respective minister to release prisioners duely sentenced by courts. It makes a joke of our justice system to release them early and return criminals to our streets. The majority of the British population does not live in the protected environment of those taking decisions and have to trust that the justice system can do its job and get off the streets the criminals, both major and minor, that make our neighbourhoods full on violent, offensive or anti-social behaviour.",
