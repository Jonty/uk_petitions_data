The police found out who the offender was, but is was just after he his 18 month sentence in a young offenders institute. Because he was at the beginning of his sentence, neither the police, nor the CPS were willing to charge him with these extra crimes of breaking and entering, and motor vehicle theft. The current system favours the criminals, and is a joke. Something needs to be done about this backward system.",
