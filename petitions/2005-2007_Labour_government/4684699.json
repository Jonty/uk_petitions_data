            "background": "Transport for London have removed the use of the third lane or \"tidal flow\" from the Blacwall Tunnel during the morning rush hour.  The system has been in use since 1978, and is needed now more than ever.  TFL state that this is on the advice of the police as the system encourages dangerous driving.  The intermittent use of the tidal flow is the only factor that stops the main route into the City of London from the Southeast becoming gridlocked.  Even with the tidal flow, the tunnel is unable to cope when there is an incident such as a breakdown, accident or overheight vehicle.",
