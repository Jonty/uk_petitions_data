            "background": "The environmental imperatives are clear that we need to encourage the use of pedal cycles instead of cars. Although the \"cycle to work\" initiative (Cyclescheme) is a welcome start, not all participating employers that can choose to pass VAT savings to employees. Not everybody is a qualifying employee, and in any case Cyclescheme favours higher earners. Therefore, for fairness and for the environment, we petition that VAT should be scrapped for all pedal cycles, accessories, parts and maintenance.",
