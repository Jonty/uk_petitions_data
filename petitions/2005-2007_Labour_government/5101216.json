            "background": "I propose a radical rethink of the way our parliament functions starting with stripping MP\u2019s and the Government / local councils of the power to raise taxation and run it like a company with shareholders. In its place we introduce a Jury style system where ordinary \u2018Tax paying\u2019 members of the public are selected at random to serve a period of time on a decision making committee. The government still creates the policies and the opposition parties can still argue against them and suggest changes and improvements. But both sides must present or sell their case and arguments in front of the \u2018share holders\u2019 committee who after deliberating over the evidence, make the final decision.\n\nIf the system is good enough to determine the life\u2019s of people on trial it should be good enough for this task.",
