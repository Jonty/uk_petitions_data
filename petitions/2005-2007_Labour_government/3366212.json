            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Environmental damage is caused by aeroplane flights, not by individual passenger flights. This auction would link the charge on an airline much more directly to the damage caused, and airlines wishing to compete would pass relatively little of the charge on to users of efficient flights such as low cost ones and business traveller oriented shuttle flights. Given the large fuel duty and VAT concessions given to airlines, there is no need to ensure tax neutrality from their point of view, but in fairness the Government would have to state its intentions on these taxes for the year following each auction. The proceeds of the auctions could be spent on research into CO2 capture and reducing CO2 emissions, or reductions in Income and Corporation Taxes calculated to match the increased burdens on domestic and business air travel.",
