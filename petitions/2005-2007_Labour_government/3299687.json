            "background": "My neighbour has replaced their old balanced flue outlet with a flue from a condensing boiler. Whereas previously the output was by pure convection, the output is now fanned over the fence into my small garden.\nBritish Gas have told us that the siting of the flue is legal and that they don't have to add an elbow directing the gases upwards or re-route the flue vertically through their roof.\nAlthough 'legal' this is a serious nuisance where more stringent restrictions are called for. Why should my family breathe their gases?",
