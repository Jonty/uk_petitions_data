            "background": "The fact that an accused man, even if found `not guilty`, is considered to be a `rapist that got away with it`, is grossly unjust and patently unfair. Also, many false allegations of rape would be stymied because the presumed intent, public humiliation and castigation, would be unavailable to a false accuser. A rape shield law for all participants would make the system simpler and fairer. If found guilty, please, reveal the scum for all to see.",
