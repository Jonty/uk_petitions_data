        "background": "There is still significant public concern about the decision to go to war in Iraq and for us as a country to be able to move on the issue of the legality of the decision must be settled in an open and public manner.  We cannot have trust in our government unless this is done.  \n\nOf equal concern to me is the disastrous state of planning for a post Saddam Iraq.  There appears to have been little or no serious thought about how to provide inclusive representative government for the country.  To invade a country with the intention of removing a dictator may be seen by some as a good idea, but to do so with no plan for the country once he is removed is criminal neglect.  It must never be allowed to happen again!",
