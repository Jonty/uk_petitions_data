            "background": "Computer science is probably the most important new field of study to appear within the past 100 years, as computers now have a large effect on all our daily lives.  Unfortunately, teaching of computing in schools often focuses on word processing and other menial office tasks.  Making all schoolchildren learn basic programming and computer science would greatly help the UK's software industry, especially as programmers' jobs are under coming under increasing threat from Indian outsourcing.  Exposure to computer science from a young age would also help to increase the number of women computer scientists.",
