        "background": "Caring brings utter poverty, loss of work pension, loss of status and power, social isolation, loss of confidence, and depression. Carers are hog-tied and made despairing by a totally unsolvable tangle of legislation / contradicting benefit rules. If they can eventually return to work, often of necessity part-time, it is a huge struggle to find a suitable job, and they have to start all over again, unaided. This is soul-destroying and grossly unfair. Those who do not have to care, never have to think about such issues at all. Carers have to worry about such issues every single day.",
