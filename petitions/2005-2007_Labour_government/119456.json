        "background": "Stop expanding the number of subjects available to learn at A-Levels and GCSE, these extra subjects take much needed funding away from the core subjects such as Science, English and Maths. This will mean that the teachers will get funds for teaching the subjects at high standards with much needed equipment, it will also allow the exam boards to concentrate on the much needed review of the exam grading system.",
