        "background": "At the moment, the Police are under no obligation to follow the laws passed by Parliament to govern their behaviour (the Police and Criminal Evidence Act \u2013 PACE).\n\nThe Courts agree with the Police that following PACE in not important, and that no-one has the right to sue the Police for breaking its own governing laws.\n\nI want the PM to state categorically that the Police must abide by PACE, and that civilians have the right to sue if the Police break any part of PACE.\n\nI understand that there must be a balance between civilian and Police rights, but at the moment the Police can do anything to someone with no evidence and they have no rights or redress against the Police abusing their powers.",
