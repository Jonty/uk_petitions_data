            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The huge influx of vehicles using UK roads and adding to congestion and wear and tear should be partially offset by introducing a modest charge, along the lines of the Swiss system but covering all roads, on incoming foreign registered vehicles.  \n\nThe charge should be related to damage caused to the roads, so that cars would pay a lower sum than LGV's, should be valid for a period of 90 consecutive days, thus tourists would pay a nominal charge for use of UK roads, business and comercial users would pay a charge more consistant with the damage they cause.\n\nFailure to display the \"vignette\" should result in a summary fine, enforced by retention of the vehicle until the charge and fine is paid.",
