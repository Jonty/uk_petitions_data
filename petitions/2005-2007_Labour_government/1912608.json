            "background": "The reseach of Evangelos Mickelakis of the University of Alberta (expanding on the work of Otto Warburg in 1930) has shown that the compound DCA shows vast promise as a pan-cancer treatment as it reactivates mitochondrial engery production in cells, causing mutated cells (ie cancers) to self destruct.\n However no clinical trials are being run on this potential treatment as no patent any longer exsists on the compound, so there is no money to be made. I believe that our goverment should show the lead in funding the requirred clinical trials.",
