            "background": "Welsh patients now have free prescriptions. English voters pay \u00a36.85 for theirs, plus \u00a330 million in subsidy for Welsh prescriptions. English voters also subsidize top-up fees for Scottish university students, while English Students have to take out loans to pay for theirs. We all paid millions of \u00a3s in taxes to build plush buildings and maintain huge running costs for the Scottish parliament and Welsh assembly. But we don't have enough money to pay for life saving treatment on the NHS or to properly support our teachers and schools. How crazy is that?\n\n\t\t\t\nWhilst the desire for national recognition is understandable, it is unfair and financially untenable to maintain these bodies as they stand at the moment. Let us find a better and more equitable way to support all individual national identities in the future but, right now, these bodies should be abolished.\n\nIf you'd like your taxes to be fairly distributed towards the whole population of the United Kingdom, please support this petition.",
