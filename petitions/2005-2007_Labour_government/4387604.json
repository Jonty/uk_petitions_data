Could a symbol of this be reflected at the Olympics. an exhibition of some kind?\n\nTitanic was the largest passenger steamship in the world at the time of her sinking, and she is infamous throughout the world. \n\nShe was built in Belfast and made her maiden voyage from the UK.\n\nThe United Kingdom should be doing the most to remember her on this anniversary the most, and it would be a major tribute to have something the world will recognise at the Olympics.",
