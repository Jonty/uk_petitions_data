        "background": "Have you ever been spied on?\n\nThere is virtually no legal protection against paparazzi photographers, nor is there sufficient protection against surveilance in the workplace (common in the USA, and likely to become more common in the UK).\n\nCameras can be astonishingly sophisticated; capable of taking high-resolution pictures from great distances not just of celebrities (who are also entitled to a private life) but  of you, your family, and your children.\n\nCommercially available sound recording equipment can also be used to eavesdrop through solid walls, or over distance.\n\nA Reasonable Expectation Of Privacy law \nwould afford ordinary people legal protection against unwarranted or abusive use of surveillance techniques by private businesses, companies, or individuals.",
