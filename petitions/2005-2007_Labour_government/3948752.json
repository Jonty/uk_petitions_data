            "background": "Domestic Animals (animals like your pets) live in a hostile world. Each day they have the same routine. Be grabbed from a cage and then have loads of stuff put in their skin have chemicals put in them, and back to the cage. Some of these animals are wild even! I looked on a website and saw a monkey in a cage. Nothing around him, except a cold, metal cage. These poor and unfortuneate creatures need HELP! Rabbits, mice, guinea pigs are all in the same lab. If this petition is succesful all of these lonely animals will benefit greatly and have the fuss and attention every domestic pet needs. Sign the petition and know you've helped these harmless creatures.",
