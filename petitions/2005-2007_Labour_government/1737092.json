            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The BrakeCare bereavement pack, produced by the road crash victim support charity BrakeCare, provides a 'plain English' explanation of the procedures that may follow a death on the road, information about common emotions following a traumatic bereavement, and signposts sources of support. It is the ONLY Government-funded support available to people bereaved by the nine deaths which happen every single day on UK roads. \n\nIn 2007, the Home Office says funding for the pack will have to cease for five years due to a 'failure to budget for it in this round of funding', despite having funded it for the past six years, despite agreeing it is a quality product deserving of funding, and despite carrying on giving about \u00a330 million to support victims of other crimes, including lesser crimes such as burglary that don't involve death and untold trauma.\n\nPlease sign this petition to urge the Home Office not to withdraw funding for this essential resource for victims.",
