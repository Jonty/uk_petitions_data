            "background": "Over recent years Traffic Wardens have become the centre of much aggression in city centres. Each day they must work while having the fear of an angry motorist launching a vicious attack on their person simply because he has been charged \u00a360 for 'nipping into Boots for Calpol'. In such a case we are not promoting the Warden to \"blow some brains\" but the motorist will be aware that the Warden could \"blow his brains\" if he saw fit. Hopefully this will eradicate most violent attacks on British Traffic Wardens.",
