            "background": "Carers are typically called upon to work in excess of 35 hours per week looking after their; Children, Spouses, Parents, Elderly Relatives, Friends; all for less than \u00a350 per week, an illegal wage for the number of hours worked.  They do this because they really care about their Carees.  If the NHS and Social Services were called upon to take over these duties it is estimated it would cost in excess of \u00a356bn per year. The least we can do is pay the minimum wage for the work they do.",
