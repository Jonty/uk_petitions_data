            "background": "Recent scares about the tax impact of road-pricing are wrong. This petition aims to make it 100% clear that:\na) road pricing is essential to persuade people to choose locations for their home/work that properly reflect the costs to society of their valid wish to exercise their free choice\nb) any road pricing scheme introduced should be \"revenue-neutral\". We say clearly that the total tax burden on motorists should not rise for a minimum two-year period, with any money raised from road-pricing being balanced by reductions in Road Tax and Fuel Duty.\nc) Since the main need for Road Pricing is to encourage people to make sensible long-term location decisions, the proposed scheme needs to be outlined at the earliest opportunity and a revenue-neutral version of the scheme introduced a.s.a.p. Only then can the populace as a whole become convinced that this is a sensible approach and then get on with arranging their lives and location choices with a minimum of disruption and uncertainty.",
