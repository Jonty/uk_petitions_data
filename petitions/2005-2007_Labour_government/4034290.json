            "background": "Insurance companies treat all people over 64 years of age as being ill. 95 per cent of annual and single trip travel insurance policies impose an upper age limit for claims. Of these, over two thirds stop at 65 and most of the remainder stop at 75.  It is only marginally better with single trip policies.  \nThe COST of cover for a 65 year old is usually more than double the premium of someone of 64 years old \u2013 probably just one day older!  The premiums then increase in 5 year increments. This is pure age discrimination coupled with financial exploitation of older people.  \nA person of 75 can be more fit and healthy than a 40 year old \u2013 WHY penalise the older person?",
