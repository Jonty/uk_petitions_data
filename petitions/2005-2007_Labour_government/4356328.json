            "background": "Many people who would like to commute by bicycle are put off by the danger from motor vehicles.  Cycle lanes are part of the solution, but they can sometimes actually increase the danger, because drivers ignore them.  I personally have been knocked off my bike twice in 3 months by drivers crossing the cycle lane without looking.\nThis drives cyclists off the road, either onto the pavement or back into their cars.\nThe problem could be solved if police and traffic wardens, potentially using CCTV, made it a priority to stop and fine motor vehicle drivers who trespass in the cycle lane.",
