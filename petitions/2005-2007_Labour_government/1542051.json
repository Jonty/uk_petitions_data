        "background": "Many religious groups in the UK are using protection of free speech and legislation protecting their religious beliefs as a means of distributing hate filled \"religious\" tracts attacking members of alternative religions or people of alternative sexual orientation. We the undersigned believe the distribution of any tracts based on religious or any political belief attacking the completely legal (and enshrined in EU law) lifestyle choice of others should be classified as a hate crime. \nThis Christian Right propaganda would be automatically outlawed if it openly engendered hate against people of colour and those of alternative religions and sexual orientations deserve the same fundamental protection in law.",
