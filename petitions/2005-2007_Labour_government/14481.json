            "background": "I pay tax to one district council, shop in another, work in a 3rd and use the leisure facilities of a 4th.\nMy council tax goes up 15-25% a year every year.\nA large amount of that tax is spent on the infrastructure, staff, accountants, and time spent to decide how much it is.\nI would prefer the government to allocate money to councils based on an allowance per head of population + an allowance per employee in local business. \nThis way the money would be collected centrally by government using the (relatively) fair systems in place for income tax and purchase tax. \nMy local democracy extends to deciding how it will be spent (or at least ways extends as far as thinking I can influence the people who decide).",
