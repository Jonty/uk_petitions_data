            "background": "The BNP is far from the anti-democratic fascists which many make them out to be, They, and many organisations such as Unite Against Fascism are being anti-democratic in their stance against the British peoples opinions. the idea of 'Britishness' as being acceptance to all and tolerance of people who want Sharia law in this country is laughable, I myself agree with the BNP's policies but I do not wish to impose my opinions on everyone else, end this age of ignorance towards more than 50% of our society and be more accepting towards those who do not share your view, or else you are being as bad as Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist party.",
