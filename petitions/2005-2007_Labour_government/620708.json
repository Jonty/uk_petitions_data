I'm sure many people are concerned about other people watching them type their PIN code in - some people don't even realise they're looking at what you type!!  Why not do something right for once and have a system that works on a \"swiped\" fingerprint (swiped rather than placed so that nobody can lift the print from the sensor).  This would be so much more secure than PIN and would vastly reduce theft of cards as they would need your print to gain access.  The prints could be securely encrypted and checked over the link to the bank.",
