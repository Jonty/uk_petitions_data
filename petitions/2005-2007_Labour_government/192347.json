            "background": "We cannot afford both parliament and royalty anymore! Politicians are too expensive. They are untrained in what they do and yet they want parity with doctors and head teachers. Cromwell must be turning in his grave, he knew about this sort of corruption and self-interest.  Taxation is getting so bad now that there is nothing out there that isn't taxed to the hilt and it can only get worse. Brown has turned into Dick Turpin rather than actually deal with anything,throwing money at the problem. Big egos create ever increasing entourages, and this is what the infrastructures have become. \nmy solution is(as the infrastructures are now there),make the royal family work for a change), anne in charge of Defra(we won't get any \u00a3200 million fines for not paying up on time). Getting rid of hundreds of mp's would save millions before even tallying their expense accounts and perks.They are just 'hogs in the trough'and removed from any 'real' reality.",
