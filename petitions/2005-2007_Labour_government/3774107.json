            "background": "As \u2018BAA\u2019 no longer stands for \u201cBritish Airports Authority,\u201d and the company is now Spanish owned, the \u2018B\u2019 should no longer be used by this company.  \u2018British\u2019 could not then be associated with businesses profiting from the refusal to fully compensate for the atmospheric damage created by flights taking off and landing at its facilities. Nor should British be linked with the extra pollution caused by BAA refusing to assist in the installation of better rail facilities to the airports, preferring to use British land to create new car parks, giving it an even larger profit margin. As a foreign company, it is further damaging this country by encouraging other foreign firms to fly too many flights, demonstrated by the fact that free seats are offered to fly out of Britain.",
