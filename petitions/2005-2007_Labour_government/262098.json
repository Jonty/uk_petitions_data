The event starts with the current prime minister in the ring awaiting other mp challengers. Every 2 minutes another minisster is sent into the ring. If a minister is forced out of the ring, they are out and are not allowed back into the ring. Under no circumstances are they allowed to help their fellow ministers who are still in the ring. This includes attacking other ministers with chairs, bells or anything else.\nAfter about 2 hours, when all the ministers have been released into the ring, the last man standing in the ring is crowned 'Prime Minister' and their party then goes on to rule the country for 4 years.",
