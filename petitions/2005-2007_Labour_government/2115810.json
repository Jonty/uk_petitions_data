            "background": "At present all the energy price comparison websites work on 'real time' tarrifs, but the dates when each supplier changes their tarrifs are completely random making informed consumer choice based on price meaningless, since one supplier may be cheapest one week but another the next.  If all suppliers were only allowed to alter their tarrifs say once every three months, on the same prescribed date each quarter, and give at least six weeks notice of their intentions, then we, Jo Public, might have a chance of making sensible decisions when choosing energy suppliers, which in turn would encourage more honest competition between suppliers to the advantage of all.",
