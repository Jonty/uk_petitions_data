            "background": "As possibly the greatest ever 5 a side team to participate in the Soccer Zone Thursday Fives, Egg FC would benefit from the celebrity endorsement of a world famous artist to raise their profile in places like Asia and the USA in an effort to boost replica shirt sales and Egg merchandise. By enlisting Lionel Richie to perform 'You Are my Destiny' for the mighty Egg FC as they enter the Soccer Zone Arena, preferably with a kit featuring an image of the aforementioned Mr Richie wearing his trademark crushed velvet suit and sunglasses, it would be a major boost to the UK economy, maximising the export of DVD sales of the team featuring such superstars as Tek 'The Cat', Ben 'Dean Windass' Forrest, G, Ben 'the other Ben' McKenzie, PC Tony, Billy 'Baddiel', Josh the wonderkid and Rug. With the increase in revenue helping to support a brave and groundbreaking training programme a place at the London Olympics is a possibility, and therefore by signing this petition you could be helping Britain to a Gold Medal on home soil in 2012.",
