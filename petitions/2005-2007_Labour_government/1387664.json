While the country does not \u2018have the funds\u2019 the ministers are flying around in private jets and go on elaborate holidays. Irrelevant of colour and class, people struggle. Crime statistics tampering and with holding information from the media are used by the ANC government to give the world a false sense of safety. In 2010 thousands of innocent sports fans are going to South Africa, unknowingly walking into a country that are just (or more) as dangerous as IRAQ. Please we urge the British government \u2013 as British citizens to at least warn people about the dangerous situation they are going into.",
