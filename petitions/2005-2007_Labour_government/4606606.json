        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The vast majority of these penalties are wrong; caused either by failings in the HMRC online submission system or incorrectly sent to businesses that had no requirement to file any PAYE end of year submissions.\n\nThis is creating an undue financial burden on the (mostly small) businesses which take the path of least resistance and pay the penalties - and a ridiculous administrative burden on those businesses (and their accountants) who are appealing the penalties.\n\nThis is a penalty which is related to the amount of tax due. In most cases the end result will be that the penalties are reduced to \u00a3100 or removed completely.\n\nHMRC have announced that they will deal with each appeal individually on its own merit. The cost to the taxpayers of this mammoth task will inevitably outweigh the penalties collected.\n\nMr. Prime Minister, we the undersigned petition you to stop this monumental waste of public resources in dealing with these appeals, and stop the undue financial and administrative burden that has been unfairly placed on the small businesses that are the backbone of the UK economy:\nMr. Prime Minister - declare an amnesty and remove these penalties.",
