        "background": "In May 2005, for the first time since 1987, Paramount stopped airing new Star Trek episodes. At the detriment of the economy, the UK has seen dwindling numbers of students taking up science and engineering. In the past, Star Trek is known to have inspired many people to pursue these subjects and ultimately careers. Star Trek also promotes tolerance and peaceful coexistence with others, regardless of sex, race, religion or any other dividing attribute. We need this now more than ever. Resurrect Star Trek!",
