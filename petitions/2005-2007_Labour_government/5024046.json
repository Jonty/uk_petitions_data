            "background": "The A329(M) is a short section of motorway in Berkshire that joins two ends of the A329.\n\nAs learner drivers, and particularly motorcyclists who have passed their CBT (even those who have renewed their CBT and have been driving for years) who are still classed as learner drivers are not allowed on motorways, this creates a significant problem to those needing to use this stretch of road frequently. They are forced to take a longer, more congested route through Wokingham.\n\nThe stretch of A329(M) which is motorway classified is no more unsafe for learner drivers than the majority of the A3 (which learner drivers are allowed to use), therefore it is illogical and inappropriate for it to have this classification.",
