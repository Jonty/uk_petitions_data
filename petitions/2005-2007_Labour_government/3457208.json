If each child was allocated a round figure of say \u00a32000 per year which would go directly to the school of their choice.  Why should OAP's pay tax for education when their money could go towards a pension.  Why should people who choose to send their children to, for example fee paying Faith Schools have to pay for their education and still pay taxes to the state for education.",
