It will be a form of an election and a boost to democracy!  Say 5,000 (votes) petitons [which is more than some House of Commons Members are elected with] and you graciously grant me a seat?  If succesful I promise to be a willing, honest, considerate, fair, hard working and energetic SERVANT to the people of the United Kingdom, so Help me God!\nYours truly,\nKevin Donnellon",
