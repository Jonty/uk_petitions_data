            "background": "This petition is for people who are for the smoking ban in college. Someone has made a petition against the smoking ban in college so I thought \"Why not fight fire with fire\". This petition would not allow anyone to sign the petition against the smoking ban and make the college a more healthy and safe place to be. We feel that there is no rush to smoke in between lectures on site so why not do it off. If you are against smoking in college, then please sign up.",
