Much of their reports and assessments are robotically generated by computer software. Their planning can be done using online resources. They are being paid huge salaries to tke responsibility for other peoples children in a roll betwixt school nurse and secretary. I have experienced this process first hand and find it an appalling misuse of government spending. Do you agree?",
