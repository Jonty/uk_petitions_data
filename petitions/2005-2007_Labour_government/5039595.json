            "background": "The denuding of shingle banks in the English Channel, to feed among others the construction industry, through continuous dredging is having a grave effect on Channel breeding grounds of fish and other aquatic sea life.\nA natural lateral drift of shingle that once enhanced coastal protection has almost ceased since the inception of Channel dredging.\nThis has resulted in an almost farcical situation of the Government funded Environment Agency using public money to 'buy back' shingle from dredging companies to build up beaches, that once were naturally strengthened for free.",
