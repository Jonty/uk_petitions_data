        "background": "The Queen mothers hospital has long been one of the best maternity and childrens hospitals in Europe. Its connection with the Western Infirmary and its affiliation Glasgow University has saved countless young lives lives. The closing of both these hospitals as well as Stobhill and Gartnavel would leave an already stretched NHS bed waiting list completely out of hand. This would leave Glasgow with one maternity unit in the Southern General, which is, for some, not the easiest hospital to get to.  Such mass closures such a short space of time can only lead to chaos and mass confusion within the NHS.",
