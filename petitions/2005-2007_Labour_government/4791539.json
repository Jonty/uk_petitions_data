His government's team state that they do not expect anyone to suffer a reduction in the quality of their television as a result of switchover (switch off), and 2. His government's team state that no-one who currently relies on terrestrial analogue television will lose their ability to receive a terrestrial signal when the switchover (switch off of analogue) to digital takes place. In the event that, despite these brave promises, there are subscribers who are seriously disadvantaged by the analogue switch off then arrangements must be made to compensate these people.",
