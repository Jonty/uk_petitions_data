It has the potential to destroy the confidence of both the domestic and international community in the integrity of Britain's MPs.\n\nThe Freedom of Information Act marked the end of the ability of government organisations to deceive the public they serve. Exempting the House of Commons, which once led the world in defining democracy, is a disgrace.",
