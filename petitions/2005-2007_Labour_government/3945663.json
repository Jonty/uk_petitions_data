        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There used to be a discount for company car users if you accrued over 18,000 business miles in a year. A high percentage of company car users are on low salaries and find the level of income tax very prohibitive, this also leads to some companies opting out of company car schemes to pseudo private leasing forcing employees to subsidize   the company with the same level as the tax liability which is grossly unfair as a percentage of earnings. Please bring back a discount option where company car use is not a perk but a necessity",
