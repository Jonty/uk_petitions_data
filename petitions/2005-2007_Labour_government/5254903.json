            "background": "SATs just stress young children out just so that league tables can be created. These league table often do not reflect a school's true standards especially in schools which have a large number of children who speak English as a second language. SATs are also only done in the core acedemic subjects meaning that talented pupils who are better at non acedemic subjects can get a big knock to their confidence. I believe therefore that these pointless exams on children should be scrapped.",
