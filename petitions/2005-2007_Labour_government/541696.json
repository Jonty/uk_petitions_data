            "background": "The A57/A628 Mottram Bypass has been desperately needed, yet always deferred, for decades now. Currently it is one of the most congested A-road routes in the country, with high volumes of traffic (including HGVs) using a road which is totally unsuitable for the volume and nature of traffic it carries. Passing in places within a metre of houses and shops, it is particularly dangerous for pedestrians. Between 2000 and 2004 there were 82 accidents on this stretch of road, including 2 fatalities. The Highways Agency itself has concluded that there is no realistic alternative to a bypass, yet despite this, funding has been put back to 2010/2011. This is simply unacceptable as this Bypass isn't just needed now, it has been badly needed for decades.",
