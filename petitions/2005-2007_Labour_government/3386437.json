        "background": "Currently the british voter has a choice of 3 major parties when voting; all of which are becoming more and more alike in the bid to gain power.  Unfortunately this is creating a lack of a true alternative, and there appears to be no clear way of feeding back voter unrest at the current situation, apart from a spoilt ballot, which could be taken as vandalism instead of protest.  By creating an additional Tick Box on the ballot card called \"none of the above\" we could clearly demonstrate the dissatisfaction and disenfranchisement the british public now feel at having no real alternative to the party we have today.",
