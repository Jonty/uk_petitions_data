            "background": "According to the BBC, every 7 minutes a member of NHS staff is assulted by a paitent, some under the influence of alcohol or drugs, costing \u00a3100m per year.\nZero Toleranceis a buzz word - Doctors should be able tio choose not to treat paitents when they feel that they are in danger of being hurt by the paitent as a result.\nCases are beign thrown out which gets nowhere, it just sends out a message saying that you are welcome to do what you like to NHS staff.\nThe training for confromtational situations seems useless, and overall, toom little is being done. \nThe governemnt should either let doctors be able to refuse to treat abusive paitents, and give them support of police officers NOT leave it to doctors, nurses and hospital security, who are not paid to deal with it as police are.\nResources need to be providing proper support for NHS staff who should be there to save lives not deal with people who expect treatment regardless of their appauling behaviour",
