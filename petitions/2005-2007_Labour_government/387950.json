            "background": "Until common laws and enforcement standards are set across the EU the UK government should oppose the introduction of a European driving licence. For instance should a EU resident be banned from driving in his/her country of domicile when he/she fails a breath test in another country? Will the same blood / alcohol levels apply throughout the EU? In respect of speeding offences does the calibration of  radar traps meet the standards of the UK? Until these issues are addressed then the UK should opt out.",
