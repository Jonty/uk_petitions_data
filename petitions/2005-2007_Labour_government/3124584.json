        "background": "The recent hike in Passport charges is far too much for low income families  and others to afford and be able to seek work abroad or to day trip across the Channel. The Government is therefore restricting by cost the right and freedom to travel of all which is a basic human right in the name of security. This is just another money making scheme for the Exchequer as passports will still be faked and altered by those who wish to do so outside the UK.",
