            "background": "By writing a letter of apology to their victims, young offenders will just laugh that they have got away with their crimes. Citing that they are \"deprived\" is just ridiculous. By sending them to help people who are really deprived, will humble the most arrogant of people. It would cost less than locking them away, and give them vocational training such as building,plumbing etc, and emotional training such as caring for individuals who have no hope without them. I would guarantee that anyone spending even six months out in a poverty stricken area would come back a new, grateful citizen and make the most of what this country has to offer.",
