            "background": "The proposed smoking ban is largely based on inaccurate statistical inference that second-hand smoking kills, despite the lack of evidence.  Minister Hewitt has stated that it \u2018will be good for business, as it was in Ireland and elsewhere.\u2019  In Ireland over 1,000 pubs closed and 6,000 people lost their jobs.  Wet sales remain down over 20% by volume. Only above inflation prices rises have brought the figures back to where such a dishonest claim can be made.\n\nThis ban will have a devastating effect on bars and especially country pubs that are already marginal businesses and will lead to the closure of many thousands of them up and down the country and the loss of circa 50,000 jobs, as well as further tearing the heart out of many local communities.\n\nLegislation to provide choice is the obvious compromise.  Ensuring adequate standards of ventilation and separate areas for smokers and non-smokers, even to the point where staff provide no service in the designated smoking areas.",
