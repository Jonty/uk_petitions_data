It is also unfair for eg. a cricket fan to subscribe to SKY SPORTS for a month of football, or a rugby fan for a week of golf. A channel should be made available on 'Digital Freeview' where viewers can be given the option to pay & view the individual international matches/competitions of their choice.",
