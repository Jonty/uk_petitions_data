        "background": "Declare those who allege the Armenian Holocaust to be racist against our loyal NATO partners Turkey. This has gone on for too long; The fact remains that we the British encouraged the Armenians to uprise against the Turks in the East so the Turks had to divert resources from the west and south, just as we paid the Arabs to do the same. There is no real evidence against the Turks, who were only defending women and children, the men having been sent to serve west and south. The Turks and Brits have been allies for centuries; don't ruin it. And don't accept it as a genocide, especially when you consider the full facts of the Armenians attacking undefended villages, and were repelled by the Kurds of estern Turkey. This is an opportunity for great discussion and academic research. Hug an enemy. Think Nelson Mandela. Learn from our global mistakes. Spread our peace and prosperity.",
