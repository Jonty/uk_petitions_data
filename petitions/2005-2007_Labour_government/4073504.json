        "background": "It pains me that people risk their lives involved in charity work which has every right to be classified as a publicily funded emergency service. British people should not expect a developed country to rely on charitable donations to allow these services to exist. Risking your life to save others is more important and more honourable than anything else and the people doing this deserve to recognised for what they do. Think about it. One day you might need them. No money and one day they will crease to exist. That will be the day that someone out there needs them.",
