            "background": "While it is understood that larger vehicles produce more harmful emissions, and it is reasonable to want to reduce vehicle emissions, it is a sigificant tax burden to larger families (3+ children) which have a reasonable necessity to own a larger vehicle.  It is often MORE environmentally friendly to have a larger family travel in one vehicle rather than two.  The proposal in the new budget will impose a significant and undue hardship on larger families.",
