            "background": "If LGV trucks are banned from Motorways between these times then the state of traffic in this country would be eased dramatically. This was introduced in Germany so that LGV's could not use the Autobahns between certain times and it worked as i can testify. Something needs to be done to alleviate the current situation. I cant see why truck drivers cannot work over night anyway??",
