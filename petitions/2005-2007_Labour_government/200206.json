            "background": "People have become so busy these days, they neglect their families (resulting if future social problems), there seems to be too much to do with only a short time to do it in, never mind chance to relax.  What the point in being one of the most advance countries in the world, having one of the best economies, possessing some of the best machinery and technology if we just keep working more.  Working 5 days a week, leaving you with only two days to do EVERYTHING else is an unfair ratio.  I'm sure people would be happier and employers would get more out of their staff.",
