            "background": "This petition is to stop members of parliement being poached by consultancy firms and multinational corporations to their own ends.  MP's earn over the national average anyway and should only have the best interests of the country as their sole reason for being at Westminster.  Also if a minister decides to leave parliement and they become a consultant for the government in any capacity they should not have any business interest in the area of industry that they are being used as consultant for.  This will cut out the large number of middlemen currently living off money which should be used for public",
