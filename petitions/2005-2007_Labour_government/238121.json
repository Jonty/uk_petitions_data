            "background": "In their 1997 manifesto Labour promised to set up a commission to look at electoral reform in the UK. They were meant to see if \na)the system needed changing\nb)what system to change it to\nThe Jenkins Commission reported their findings in 1998 and along with other recomendations suggested that the Labour government adopt an AV+ system (for more information see wikipedia). The Labour government never implemented this change even though its benefits are huge and negatives are few and far between (a rare thing in electoral systems). I propose the Prime Minister should implement the AV+ system, replacing the First-Past-the-Post system at General Elections.",
