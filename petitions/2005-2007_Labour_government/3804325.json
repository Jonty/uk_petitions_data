        "background": "I have noticed that there are a couple of petitions about Wicca, Witchcraft and Paganism, but both of these state that Witchcraft and Paganism are religions, when they are not. Paganism is the umbrella term that encompasses many belief systems, such as Wicca, Druidry, Heathenry, Asatru etc...\n\nWitchcraft is a practice and not a religion, and many Pagans of the different faiths use Witchcraft in their rites.\n\nI decided that a petition should be started to have Wicca recognised as a religion on it's own, rather than as part of something else.",
