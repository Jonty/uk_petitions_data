        "background": "Let's ban the sale of non-energy efficient lightbulbs and make a real difference. \n\nAnd before anyone asks.. it will cost me too - I've just moved into house with halogen bulbs! \n\nI know the argument will be that it will punish people who can't afford energy efficient light bulbs (even though they are much cheaper in the long run) but the government has forced people to switch from analogue to digital television, meaning that everyone has to buy a set top box - and yet we still have the option to buy lightbulbs which are (by the governments own admission) causing global warming. \n\nThe government are always banging on about energy savings in the home being the key to saving us from disaster - make the decision for us.. ban non-energy efficient light bulbs!",
