            "action": "Instigate legislation to force all surface railway operators in Great Britain to provide a carriage on all trains dedicated to the carriage of small goods, prams, pushchairs and bicycles.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "During the privatisation of the national railway network, the applicants for franchises were freed to provide no means by which their trains would have to include a carriage dedicated to the carriage of small goods, prams, pushchairs and bicycles. Whatever the reason for the government choosing to pursue such a course, with the advent of CO2 emissions targets, increased numbers of people wanting to cycle, road congestion, etc; is it not time that the government reviewed and revised this decision? I firmly believe that the British people should have returned to them the guard's carriages that were lost to them through the railway privatisation process.",
