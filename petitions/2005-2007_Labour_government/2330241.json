            "background": "Build additional railway lines parallel to existing rail lines to take heavy goods vehicles off the roads. \nNew railway lines can be built alongside motorways specifically to take goods vehicles and palleted cargo.\nDistribution would be quicker, more efficient and goods depots would be set up for local distribution at rail points. With less road congestion and cleaner use of rail transport, this would also reduce pollution.\nIncentives should be given to transport companies and to companies operating large fleets of vehicles, such as the Supermarket chains, Argos and manufacturing organisations to make use of the railways.",
