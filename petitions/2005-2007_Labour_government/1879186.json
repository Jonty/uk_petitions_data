            "background": "I find it incredible that a person who breaks into YOUR property to steal YOUR belongings and possibly cause YOU bodily harm, has the right to make criminal charges against YOU if they are \"caught in the act\" and force is used against them.\n\nAn aquaintance of mine recently caught a man breaking into his home where his wife and two young children were sleeping. Needless to say his \"protective instinct\" took over and now, amazingly faces criminal charges against him.\n\nIf burglers knew that they run the risk of suffering some form of physical retribution from the occupant (if caught), with no charges against the occupant being made, they would think twice about doing it in the first place.\n\nMore rights should be given to those who conform to the rules of society and less to those who do not.",
