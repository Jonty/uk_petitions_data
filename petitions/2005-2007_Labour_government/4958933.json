            "background": "The purposes of this petition is to call upon government to sort out the public transport mess. Global warming seems to be a fact and we are constantly being called upon to reduce carbon emissions without being given a credible alternative to using personal transport. Buses and rail need to be reintegrated into a national/regional network offering affordable fares and  accessibility. Significant public investment needs to take place in the infrastructure and take public transport out of the hands of the profit makers.",
