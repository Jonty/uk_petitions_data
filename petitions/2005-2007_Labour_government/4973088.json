        "background": "We've all seen them, the pond life that make a living getting tickets for events we want to go to and then selling them on to the highest bidder. Worse still some people try and make money out of free events such as Radio 1's big weekend. I'm hoping that this may go someway to putting a stop to this. Fair enough some poeple can have a change of circumstances but they should only be allowed to sell them at face value, that way they get their money back. I mean this to cover all events including music gig's and sporting events. Stop the touting low-lives and make them get a proper job. This will mean that more genuine fans can get hold of the tickets they'd so dearly love.",
