            "background": "It has been anounced that Wales will benefit from free prescriptions from 1st April 2007.It is very unfair that England should be charged \u00a36.65 per item. \nPrescription charges are unafordable for many especially those with chronic illness and people on low incomes that don't qualify for help.The current cost for each prescription in England is \u00a36.65 and I am campaigning to get England's prescription charges dropped and have the same rights as wales to free prescriptions.",
