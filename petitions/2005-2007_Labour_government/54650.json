        "background": "Currently anyone or any company that wishes to immobilise vehicles on private property has to be licensed under the Private Security Industry Act. This act provides no regulation or guidance on fines, which has created an environment where clamping companies can charge whatever they like. There is also no official dispute resolution scheme - clamping companies are answerable to no one. If you have a complaint or question the validity or size of the company's fine, you only have that company to complain to.",
