            "background": "There is a new tax being introduced in Northern Ireland which replaces Council Tax with a tax of 1% of the property value. it is strongly rumoured to be a trial for the mainland. A tax  like this bears no relation to the services provided and takes no account of ability to pay. It mearly penalises people who happen to live where houses are worth more. Average families living in average houses pay more than enough tax already and a three bedroom house is a three bedroom house wherever you are in the country.",
