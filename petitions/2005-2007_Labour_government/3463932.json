            "background": "Many employers change the workplace of  their staff on a regular basis, eg office workers required to work in different locations. These employees then use their vehicles on already congested roads to travel to the alternative workplace, often passing colleagues travelling in the opposite direction to carry out an identical job in a neighbouring town.\n\nI propose that employers consider the impact upon the environment of increased journeys and congestion when relocating employees resulting in increased travelling by car.",
