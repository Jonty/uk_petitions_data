        "background": "The Small Claims track of the County Court is currently the only legal means for individuals and small businesses to recover losses.  However, even if the claim is successful, the burden remains on the claimant to privately enforce the award, incurring further time and expense with no guarantee of a successful outcome.  We believe that this is unreasonable and undermines the credibility of the system, and therefore call for the State to enforce these judgements on behalf of the claimant.",
