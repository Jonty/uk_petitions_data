            "background": "Instead of jurys and judges and laws we should have trial by combat where the accused can face their accuser mano e mano in a fight to the death until they're dead. In the case that the accuser is the state someones name should be picked out a hat and they have to fight, wether they like it or not, even if they're a baby or have no arms. I think wrestling is best but they could have an arena with guns and chainsaws and swords and lawnmowers and stuff to pick up if they like. And it would be on tv replacing all the bbc's current programming entirely. People would commit crimes just to be on TV. It'd be awesome. And the general election should be done the same way. But in an arena with electric fences and flamethrowers. And if you win a fight you can get prizes depending on how the tv audience can text in thumbs up or thumbs down and if you get all thumbs down you get dropped in a pit of fire and burned to death even if you won but the more thumbs up its prizes baby. End of.",
