The consequences of this can cause considerable suffering and change the lives of victims, and their families, in devastating ways; sometimes for the rest of their lives.  And yet, apparently (and appallingly/amazingly), there is no specific offence to deal with this so that the perpetrator can be punished appropriately.",
