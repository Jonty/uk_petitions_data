        "background": "I feel adopting the Euro would bring us closer to our European Union neighbours (which is very much a good thing), would benefit British consumers\u2019 and businesses\u2019 positions in the single market and would bring the immediate benefit of lowering our mortgage payments. My reasoning behind this is that the Eurozone's interest rate is 3.25%, inflation is 1.6%, compared to the UK's interest rate at 5.0% and inflation at 2.4%. I'm no economist, but I would argue that this would lower the monthly mortgage payment for everyone, and bring relief to  often financially over-stretched families and single people.",
