            "background": "Introduce a legally binding system for buying a home where once the offer is accepted by both parties it is legally binding. Currently sellers are caused much stress and grief by non-serious purchasers. Purchasers, likewise, are often put out of pocket after spending much money on surveys, searches and solicitors only for the seller to pull out. This would make the introduction of HIPS much more useful and also stop gazumping.",
