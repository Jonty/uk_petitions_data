            "background": "We need to introduce a tax allowance to encourage workers to work close to home or from home. Less distance to work will result in less time in a car or bus, thus, lower CO2 emissions, not to mention the social benefits of spending more time with the family. We need, as a nation to encourage the understanding that more travel time results in more greenhouse gases. This simple measure would focus minds on a very practical way to reduce our emissions.",
