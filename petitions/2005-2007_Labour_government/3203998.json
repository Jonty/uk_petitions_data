        "background": "Due to gross mismanagement by our Chief Executive Averil Dongworth my local hospital's Accident & Emergency(A&E), Intensive Care Unit(ICU) and Coronary Care Unit(CCU) are under treat of closure. \n\nWhen the Wellhouse Trust amalgamated with Chase Farm Hospitals NHS Trust a \u00a36 million debt was brought to the merger. This debt has been allowed to grow to over \u00a330 Million.\n\nAs a result there are plans to close the A&E, ICU and CUC; in general make Chase Farm a non acute hospital.\n\nThis has serious and wide range implications; firstly the health of the Enfield residents will be seriously put at risk.\n\nThe longer it takes to arrive and receive treatment the higher the mortality.Research has shown treatment within the first hour (Golden Hour)significantly increase a person's survival.\n\nSecondly, the A&E's at North Middlesex and Barnet cannot cope with the extra demand (an extra 35000 patients a year).\n\nI cannot understand how can a Chief Executive with an appalling record of financial  mismanagement can be allowed to continue. How can central government allow this to happen with all the talk about  making the NHS financially responsibile.",
