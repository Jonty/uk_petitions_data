The \"perpetrator\" for performing the \"illegal act\" and the \"victim\" for consenting to it, and thus making themselves an accessory to the same crime. It is absurd, when consenting adults enjoy themselves in private, the fact that they ARE consenting has no relevance whatever in law. The consenting nature of the act should, in itself, be established as a legal defense against prosecution.",
