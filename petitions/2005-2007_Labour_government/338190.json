        "background": "Disabled People living in the UK are deliberately attacked due to their impairments or systematically abused due to the very fact that they are deemed to be 'disabled' and thereby an easy target.  In the same way that rascism is tackled by legislation, I would like the government to create legilsation to protect those who are often the most vulnerable in society.  This should also extend to the name calling and detrimental humour where it is still acceptable to laugh or mock people seen as 'different'.",
