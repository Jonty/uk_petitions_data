            "background": "The current tour of duty for armed forces personnel in Afghanistan and Iraq stands at 6 months.  The amount of stress placed upon our armed forces is unfair.  They are under immense pressure, separated from their friends and families, surrounded by casualties and fatalities among comrades and their morale being duly affected.  The maximum tour of duty should be set at 3 months for all tours.",
