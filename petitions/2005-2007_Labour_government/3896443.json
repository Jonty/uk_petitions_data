            "background": "Each year the general public is subject the annual insult of being told to limit pay demands and to restrict our spending by increasing our cost of living, with interest rises and Tax increases yet at the same time MPs Vote themselves large pay rises. In order to concentrate their minds on the cost of living of the majority of people and make them work to make the UK increasingly profitable their pay rise should be limited to the average pay increase given to the public sector workers. After all if the Chancellor can calculate that a pay rise of 2% is good for Nurses then it should be good enough for MPs",
