        "action": "instruct the Department for Transport to liaise with Network Rail and Transport for London to complete the 12 car South Eastern Networker project which was terminated abruptly on 31st March, 1993.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Networker project was designed to increase train lengths on Charing Cross and Cannon Street suburban lines from 10 to 12 cars.  At the same time, power supplies were to be increased to enable a 16% reduction in journey times which would have led to more trains being operated with the same sized fleet.  Some platforms were extended to 12 cars but many were not.  Some of the required signalling changes were made but others were not.  The power supplies were not improved.  South Eastern suburban rail services are some of the most overcrowded in the country and overcrowding is becoming worse.  Completion of the scheme would enable longer trains to run and go some way to alleviating this overcrowding.",
