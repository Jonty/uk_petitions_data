        "background": "Victoria Pier has stood in the middle of the beautiful Bay of Colwyn, North Wales, for over a century. Like most seaside resorts in the UK, Colwyn Bay has suffered decline due to cheap package holidays, lack of inward investment, ill-conceived local council schemes etc. Like most seaside piers, Victoria Pier has suffered from lack of investment since the 1960s and the years have taken their toll. Less than half the piers built in the UK still survive, please make sure Victoria Pier doesn't disappear beneath the waves too.",
