But sometimes we need that lone individual. \n\nSomeone to cut through the spin, to know what the voters really want - in short someone who will take those tough decisions.\n\nStep forward Phil Woodford.\n\nPhil is the King of Words, the Master of the Media. He even admits to liking The Dooleys, Love Patrol! \n\nHis web site even says \u2018oddball\u2019! \n\nwww.philwoodford.com\n\nHe\u2019s been involved in politics at the highest level \u2013 OK, unsuccessful parliamentary candidate. But he knows how to walk the corridors of power and how to push past all those little cliques and the political wannabees.\n\nSingle-minded, focused. Call it what you will.\n\nPhil won't let us down.\n\nVote for Phil.\n\nPS He's a jolly nice guy as well.",
