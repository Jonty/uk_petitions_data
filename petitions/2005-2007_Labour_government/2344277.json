            "background": "This treaty was intended to provide a reciprocal relationship between the UK and the US, aiding the extradition of suspects from one country to another on the basis of suspicion. However, the US has not ratified this treaty as it infringes on their constitution, meaning that only UK citizens are exposed to this gross infringement of civil liberties, being extradited on little more than a suspicion, whereas US suspects are entitled to a full hearing, (with sound evidence) before being extradited. This one-way relationship is simply not acceptable in any way, shape or form.",
