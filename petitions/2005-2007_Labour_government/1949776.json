This has resulted in the value of state benefits being eroded plunging claimants into a ever downwards spiraling of the value of the benefits. Pensioners and benefits claimants deserve better.\nWe need the link restored NOW and also want this link backdated to give us a realistic rate of pansion / benefit",
