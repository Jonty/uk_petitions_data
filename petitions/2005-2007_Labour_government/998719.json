During the period of the bid you couldn't go ANYWHERE in London without being exhorted to back it yet there seemed to be no way to OPPOSE it; almost like an \"election\" in a one-party state.  The cost of them should be raised by either a COMPLETELY VOLUNTARY public subscription, an extension to the Lottery Dream Ticket, or a combination of these.",
