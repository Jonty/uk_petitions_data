            "background": "Many functions of UK life, particularly business life, have an annual rhythm that is geared to the calendar year. The academic year is out of step with this rhythm, and for that reason, it should be changed to align with the calendar year. Historically, the boundary between one academic year and the next has been the long summer holiday. This was to allow young people to be temporarily released from academic education, to work on the land in farming. Even though this reason has now disappeared, there would be no reason to abandon the long academic summer holiday with this proposal. It is just that the summer holiday would occur between the second and third terms, if the proposal was adopted.",
