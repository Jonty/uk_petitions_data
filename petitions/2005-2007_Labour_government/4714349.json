            "background": "I propose to initiate the introduction of a gradual ban on all motorcycles in the UK. Something has to be done to restrict these brutes and the personal injuries which are inflicted upon even the most careful of riders. They are out-dated modes of transport on present-day roads. The hazards are just too numerous to list. Apart from a danger to innocent members of the public, these high-velocity death-traps are also responsible for an inordinate number of permanent injuries. Thereby, an increased burden on our over-stretched National Health. Something HAS to be done. We have moved on from the 60's.",
