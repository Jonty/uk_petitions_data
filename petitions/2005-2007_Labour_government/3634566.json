        "background": "A reformed House of Lords should be distinct from and independent of the House of Commons.  Candidate organisations not involved in elections to the House of Commons (such as charities, pressure groups, religious and community leaders) and not tied to geographic constituencies should ensure this.  The proportion of elected Lords should equate to the turnout in that election, with the remaining members being appointed by an independent body.",
