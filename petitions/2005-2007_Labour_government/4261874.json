Students who are achieving far higher results than their fellow students in state schools should be allowed to excel in learning while those who are achieving less can therefore be focused at by teaching in the state schools to improve their learning in tandum.\nState schools are often not good at identifying or supporting students with learning difficulties, such as Dyslexia and Dysfractia while the private system again excels and supports such students so they can reach their potential.\nThe private school system also provides 1000s of jobs in the country, aswell as supporting the state and grammar system, as parents are already paying for their children to goto a state school, yet choose to send them to private school.",
