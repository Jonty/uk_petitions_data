        "background": "...the way councils in Britain band their citizens according to needs.After speaking to many people we have been made aware of the following questions that are often asked:\nAre we seeking asylum?To be housed we must be an asylum seeker.Are we pregnant?The easiest and only way to be housed is to be a young mother.Do you have a disability?Are you aged 16-20?When we reach 21 is it acceptable for us to be homeless?Many British citizens have lived in the UK the majority of their lives but yet we have no rights.Have we not all paid our taxes?After a few years of being on the housing register and now becoming homeless we are furious at our local council for not helping us.We have been told that we must rent privately and apply for a 'budget loan'.This is all very well but we aren't unable to rent privately, as if we were we wouldn't have 'troubled' the council.Later info that we were given informed us to claim Job Seekers so our full rent would then be paid.This encourages them not to work.",
