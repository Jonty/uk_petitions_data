            "background": "Our Local Politician tells us that there is no money in the pot to have the speed limit reduced. Local areas such as Whitstable have 20MPH limits but a small village such as Herne still has a 30/40MPH limit, I have followed HGV's and Buses travelling at in excess of 50Mph, the road is uneven and we are told that until a life is lost nothing can be done, we have speed camera signs and no cameras. Please anyone wishing to help a small village which has two schools with a total of 400 pupils attending help us to make it safe for us to walk our children to school. The village Bus Shelter has been wiped out and there is an accident on a regular basis but unfortunately for us no death as yet!!",
