        "background": "The Government should provide funding into ME and research for a cure.\n\nMyalgic encephalomyelitis or chronic fatigue syndrome has only been recognised by doctors in recent years, after originally being dismissed as 'yuppie flu'.\n\nThe first symptoms are, in fact, often similar to flu, but they do not go away and, in many cases, may become worse.\n\nSome experts remain to be convinced of its existence as a discrete illness, mainly because no one cause has been identified and symptoms often vary for different patients. \n\nSome patients also have difficulty in concentrating, short-term memory impairment, sore throats, headaches and insomnia.\n\nSome people have such severe symptoms that they are confined to bed while others only suffer fatigue when they come up against stressful situations.",
