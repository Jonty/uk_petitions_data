It stands for absolutely nothing, having managed to do away with the one bit of meaning most easily incorporated in an Olympic logo - the 5 rings for the 5 continents.\n\nThe former logo, with the ribbon in the shape of the Thames, the 5 coloured rings, and the simple text \"LONDON 2012\" was infinitely preferable, and its reinstatement would be a vast improvement.",
