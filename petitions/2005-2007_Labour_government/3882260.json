            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The recent council trend of strategically placing traffic calming schemes including speed cushions are causing millions of pounds worth of damage to thousands of cars accross the UK. Damage to suspension, uneven wear to tyres and damage to lower engine parts cost consumers millions of pounds each year, and further increase unneccessary land fill mass accross the UK. Add to this the extra pollution caused in the most built up of areas due to the continuous acceleration and braking of cars passing through these traffic calming schemes, and the environmental impact is immense.\n\nI therefore petition the prime minister to remove these traffic calming schemes, and to invest in more advanced schemes such as those used accross the continent. These schemes are largely based around speed sensitive traffic lights that will halt traffic approaching over the local speed limit.",
