        "background": "It has been announced this week that thousands of prisoners are to be released early because our prisons are overcrowded. This is a disgrace. The Government has failed to tackle the underlying cause of the increasing prison population which is that sentences are too lenient and prison no longer poses a deterrent to criminals. Increasingly criminals are taking calculated risks in carrying out their crimes because they now perceive that 'crime does pay'. We must have tougher prison sentences to restore the deterrent effect of going to prison so that the honest citizens of this country feel they are being protected.",
