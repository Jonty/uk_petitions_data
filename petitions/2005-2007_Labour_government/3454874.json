        "action": "Instigate an investigation into how the High Street Banks are penalising customers, by closing the accounts of those who complain",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "One tactic recently adopted by the average High Street Bank is to close the account of a customer who has either complained about, or claimed a refund of, an illegal overdraft charge.\n\nMake no bones about it, this practice is nothing more than an act of retaliation.\n\nBanks like to give the impression that they care for and support the local community. However, behind the false smile they are more than ready to come down hard upon any individual or group who does not toe the line.\n\nThis is unacceptable. The Banks have encouraged a lending frenzy without caring about how it is repaid, as long as it IS repaid. The view that the Banking industry want things to go only their own way is an understatement.\n\nSo please give us your support. Thank You.",
