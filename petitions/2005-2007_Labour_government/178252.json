            "background": "It is proposed that the existing Type A hangar, 1928 Operational ready room and separate sector building is to be demolished to make way for a new development as a result of the closure of RAF Bentley Priory and RAF Uxbridge. The buildings are the last remaining BoB infrastructure still in use by a flying squadron and are important to the heritage and spirit of the Royal Air Force. To allow demolition to save money is extremely short-sighted - it is not just the RAF's heritage, it is the Nation's too.",
