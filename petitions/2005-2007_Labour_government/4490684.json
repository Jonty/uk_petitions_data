        "action": "Help get more computers for older people on low income and other disadvantaged groups meeting the requirements of EU Directive",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We would like your help with  encouraging Councils, Gov Departments large firms, computer manufacturers etc to look into benefiting the local community with their old computers and adopt a differnt policy to work with Social Enterprises. Such computers can be an invaluable tool for the disadvantaged members of our local community where we all live. As per the EU WEEE Directive this also ensures that re-use is given priority and ensure that dumping of computers in Africa is avoided and the public sector can set the right example for others to follow.\n\nI work for social enterprise and we turn the problem of old computers from large organisations into opportunities and resources for the local disadvantaged communities for example young unemployed people getting experince in the process leading to jobs. \n\nHaving recently launched a new initiative with older people charity and some london key stakeholders which has already supplied free computers to older people drop in day centers across the capital preventing digital and social exclusions. However we have a shortage of computers as the demand is outstripping supply.",
