            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At present each car owner faces a poll tax per car in the form of the road fund licence. It would be better if this were abolished and the revenue raised by means of increased fuel duty.\n\nThis would have the benefit of taxing all foreign owned vehicles who currently pay virtually nothing for the upkeep of the road infrastructure in the UK especially foreign lorries. \n\nIt would encourage the ownership of more economical cars thus saving fuel, most of which needs to be imported, aiding both the UK balance of payments and the environment. It would also discourage the use of cars for short journeys which are generally less fuel efficient and cause more pollution.\n\nPut simply the more you use your car and the less efficient it is the more you pay.",
