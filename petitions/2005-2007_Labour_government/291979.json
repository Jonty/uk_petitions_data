This once powerful institution is now reduced to a formal and ceremonial role, maintaining few of its original powers and areas of intervention. I propose granting more judicial power to this House, under the Lord Chancellor's direction and guidance. According to this petition, the House would have the final word if the Courts proved unable to solve a case or if it took too long.",
