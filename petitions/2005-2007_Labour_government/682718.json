            "background": "Over recent years the population of our country has increased dramatically. \nLast year we witnessed the largest increase in population mainly due to immigration, which has been out of control for years. It is obvious that our roads, N.H.S., public transport, schools, prisons and housing cannot cope. It is time that the government realised that you can\u2019t get a quart into a pint pot and that all these problems are created by over population. No matter how much money the government throw at these issues the fact is, the population is growing faster than the country can sustain and if immigration is not stopped now these problems will rapidly worsen. It is time the cause of the country\u2019s problems were addressed and not just the symptoms.",
