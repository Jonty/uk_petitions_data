        "action": "Abolish the plans for road pricing and to put HGV (Container) traffic back on the railways where it was designed to go.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The greatest amount of congestion comes from HGV traffic and road pricing will only drive traffic onto minor roads as in Spain.  This will destroy many small villages and increase cost of goods in the retail industry.  Forcing container traffic to use the rail network to depots, to be serviced by smaller vehicles will ease congestion and keep prices down.  This country was the envy of the world with its rail and canal system but successive governments pushed by the Road Hauliers \"Mafia\" have constantly failed to address the real problem.",
