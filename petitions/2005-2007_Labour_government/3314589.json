            "background": "An immigration appeal tribunal case on the 7th March 2007 will challenge the current DR Congo country guidance in which the Home Office claims there is no risk on return to \u201crefused\u201d asylum seekers. \nEven if a deportee had no history of persecution in the DRC, they may be branded a political dissident simply because they claimed asylum in Europe, and as such, could face imprisonment and torture on return.  \nAll DRC deportees are in danger because they risk being interrogated at the airport to see if there is a political \u201ccharge\u201d against them, or just to extort a \u201cfine\u201d. Some don\u2019t have any means to pay a \u201cfine\u201d and may be imprisoned, possibly indefinitely. The Home Office admits that DRC prison conditions are \u201clife threatening\u201d, synonymous with disease, hunger, abuse, torture and death. \nWe would urge you to support the appeal.",
