I can not fill out a form in England and tick my nationality as English. It is my human right to be English and acknowledged as being English. My flag is the St George Cross. If the Irish can be Irish, the Welsh can be Welsh and the Scottish can be Scottish, then the English can be recognised as English - not British!! The human rights act says so!! Stand up for your right to be English and proud! Stick it to the PC Idiots!",
