            "background": "Its been a long time since The Beatles did anything good, and The Flaming Stars - namely:\n\nJoe Whitney - drums\nHuck Whitney - guitar\nMax D\u00e9charn\u00e9 - vocals, keyboards\nMark Hosking - guitar\nPaul Dempsey - bass;\n\nare a critically underrated, unacknowledged popular combo and are horrifically and spitefully ignored by todays music industry. Maybe they like it that way, but I dont, and neither should you. For a band that consistently hit the heights with every release, that consistently are true to their beliefs, and hairstyles, and creaking keyboards, I think this country needs to get really and show their support for true genius. So please sign this petition to get them the honour they deserve.",
