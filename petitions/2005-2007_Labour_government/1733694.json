            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It seems obvious to many that the only long term answer to the World's energy demand is Fusion power.  It is vastly safer than fission (current nuclear generation) and generates power on an large enough scale to replace our existing infrastructure.  \n\nHowever, fusion power seems to be shackled in the slow lane, with estimates quoting 2040 to 2050 before commercial fusion plants are up and running - far too late to substantially influence any effect humans may be having on the World's climate. \n\nIf there was sufficient political will then this research program could be accelerated substantially.\n\nThis petition also asks that when fusion technology becomes available that it is distributed across the world, so that all may benefit.",
