            "background": "Working parents usually have to pay for childcare out of their hard-earned money, unless they are fortunate enough to have help from relatives available free of charge, or have working hours which are encompassed by the school day. The Government is supposed to be encouraging family-friendly working hours & practises; allowing the cost of childcare to be set against tax would enable parents, particularly women and professionals such as GPs (who are being coerced into offering later appointments), to work different or longer hours without being financially penalised.",
