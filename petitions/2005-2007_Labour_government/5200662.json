        "background": "I believe the proposal to fund Iman training is a disgrace. The message is, the more intolerant we are, the money government cash we'll get. Taxpayers money should not be used to promote any religion. Radical clerics are indeed a problem, but believe the solution can be better solved using the legal system. Clerics who radicalise children or promote hatred can be prosecuted under existing incitement to racial hatred laws if the police were allowed to do so without being accused of being racist. They can also be deported if they really are the threat to national security that is being cited...the HRA specifically allows for this contingency.",
