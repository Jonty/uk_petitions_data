            "background": "Prevent dangerous criminals being released after serving only 35% of the full sentence - if they enter an early guily plea (70%) and get full parole (50%). Let the sentence discount, courts offer, reflect the certainty of convinction and take into account the views of the victims; or if deceased, the next of kin of the victims. Give courts greater powers to keep non-violent offenders in jail beyond the halfway point of their sentences if they might pose a risk to the public.",
