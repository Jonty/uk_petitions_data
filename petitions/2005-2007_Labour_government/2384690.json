It will give us the psychological edge over our competitors when marketing our goods / services in other foreign countries or when foreign trade representatives visit the UK and notice how educated is our nation about the culture and the language of the prospective buyer.  Imagine the impact it can have when an airport taxi driver is able to communicate in more than one language or is aware about more than one culture. Learning foreign cultures / languages shouldnt be for the privilege, the restricted few or a right enjoyed by the elite only.  It must be a classless subject for all to study and to have an input in for the good of our nation and the image of the UK worldwide.",
