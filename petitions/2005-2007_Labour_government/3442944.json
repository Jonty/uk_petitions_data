        "background": "With the proliferation of speed cameras, the ever-decreasing speed limits around our country, the rise in fines and the trend to penalise the motorist for ever-minor speed infringements it is time that penalty points are separated from fines. Penalty points should be reserved for more-serious speeding offences and dangerous driving. It is wholly wrong for someone to lose their driving licence and, potentially their livelihood, for trivial speeding offences.",
