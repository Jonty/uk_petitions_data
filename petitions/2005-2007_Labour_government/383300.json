Decent polite people suffer at the hands of those who disregard others people, whether it be playing lou music in residential areas at unsocial times or spitting for no reason, swearing in front of young children etc.  Although these things seem like common sense and shouldn't need to be part of our education system, if at the end of the day these people are not being guided properly at home then for our benefit they should be taught in school - for all our sakes!",
