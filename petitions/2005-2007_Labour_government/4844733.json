        "background": "Currently within China, large numbers of people are being tortured and persecuted, even to death, for practicing Falun Gong, a peaceful meditation practice.  To date, 3024 practitioners have been killed as a result of being persecuted, at least 6,000 have been illegally sentenced to prison and over 100,000 have been sentenced to forced labour camps.  Recent evidence has also highlighted the fact that the practice of organ harvesting from unwilling Falun Gong practitioners may be taking place, sometimes while they are still alive, to provide organs for transplants. \n\n\nWe, the undersigned, ask the Prime Minister to speak up against these crimes, and raise these issues with high ranking officials in China, especially in light of the forthcoming 2008 Beijing Olympic Games.",
