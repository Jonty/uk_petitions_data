        "background": "During an election a spoiled ballot paper can mean many things but the electoral system, quite rightly, does not allow the meaning to be investigated. It may be that the ballot was spoiled by mistake or that a statement is being made. A deliberately spoiled box on the ballot (or a no confidence box) would, if counted, make a clearer statement than a low electorate turnout.",
