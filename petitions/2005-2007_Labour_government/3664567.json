            "background": "Medical Training Application Service (MTAS) is a brand new process to select doctors for post graduate medical training programmes in UK. \n\nMTAS has now finished short listing of doctors who will be interviewed shortly in deaneries across the country. \n\nThe basis of scoring candidates to be short listed for interviews is very vague. The application has sections to look at candidate\u2019s academic achievement, career progression, publications, etc which are all very good. But most marks are allocated to hypothetical answers to different questions. \n\nHence a candidate is more likely to get selected to a training programme if he can write good stories and incidents. Many candidates have taken help from their seniors, families, friends, colleagues and even professional application writers to complete their application. \n\nThe whole selection system is biased and flawed. This has left many deserving doctors not being short listed to the interviews and their careers being ruined.",
