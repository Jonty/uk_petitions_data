In warm climates the larvae may leave the containers for pupation after only 3\u20134 days. In such places, garbage has to be collected at least twice a week. In temperate climates once a week is sufficient.\"\n\nWe ask the government to take active steps to compel local authorities to safeguard public health by conforming to the minimum acceptable standards set out by WHO.",
