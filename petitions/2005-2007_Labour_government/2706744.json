        "background": "Gloucestershire Council propose to close Hempsted Bridge to traffic when the new by-pass opens. This will mean loss of trade for local businesses, and inconvenience to residents. \n\nThere is no need to close the bridge to traffic. It will still be open to pedestrians and cyclists so there will still be a need for a gate-keeper.",
