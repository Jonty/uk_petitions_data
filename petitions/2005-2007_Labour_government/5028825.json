        "background": "We here at the Talented Young People organisation understand the importance of motivating young people and the effect that motivation can have on young people. We believe that if each school was to employ a full time fully trained youth motivator to work with the pupils then we would have pupils coming out of schools with better grades and more people knowing what they want to do with their lives. We have many fine educators but now we need some brilliant motivators. We need young people to have set aside time each week in their timetable for either motivation lessons, workshops or one on ones with staff who know how to motivate young people.",
