        "background": "Every year, I duly buy my fishing licence (currently \u00a324.50)\n\nAfter 20 - odd years of fishing, I was finally asked to produce my licence by an Environment Agency Baliff for the first time ever.\n\nHe informed me that he was the only Baliff covering the whole of Northamptonshire - and that he only works part-time.\n\nI know a post-mistress and asked her how many rod licences she sells every year.\nShe was unsure, but said that she had sold 46 full licences in the first 2 months so far (not counting temporary licences)\n\nThat is \u00a31,127!\n\nIf this is typical of any Post Office and there are (conservative estimate) 200 Post Offices in Northamptonshire, that's \u00a3225,400 for one county, in just 2 months!\nAnd they only employ one, part-time baliff!\n\nHow much does it total across all the counties of Britain?\nDoes the administration of licences account for all of this money!\nIf not, where is the money going?\n\nWhat are Anglers paying for?",
