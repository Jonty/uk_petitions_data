Every time there's a tackle, up pops a yellow card. I'm talking metaphysically now of course.\"\n and \"The ref was vertically 15 yards away. He has a moustache.\"\nThe youth of today should not have to be restricted from the babblings of the man who invented the wide awake club. Therefore I petition you to bring back Big Ron. His one little racist mistake should not be held against him and deprive the rest of us with quality entertainment. Bring back Ron.",
