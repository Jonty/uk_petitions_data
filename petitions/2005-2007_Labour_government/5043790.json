            "background": "We the undersigned, petition the prime minister to impose heavy taxes on all imported goods which origionate from factories (particularly from China and India) where there are little or no environmental controls, and to make this on the basis of emissions produced at any stage of the production of the said goods, from the sourcing of raw materials to the finished product. We ask the prime minister to then ring fence the money taken in these taxes and use every penny of it to created UK jobs and to bolster manufacturing industry in the UK, for example, by way of grants for factory refits of all kinds in order to minimize polution eminating from UK factories. \nWe also ask the prime minister to consider the future implications of what is likely to happen if the skills base for manufacturing in the UK no longer exists, from the point of view of how expensive imported good are likely to become when the overseas manufacturers consider that we are no longer able to produce these goods ourselves.",
