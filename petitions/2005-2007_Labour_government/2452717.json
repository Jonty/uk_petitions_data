        "background": "As the rules stand at the moment a disabled person can work 16 hours a week and claim working tax credit but thier partner / carer has to work 30 hours a week if the couple want to claim W.T.C. \nSurely its better to let the carer claim on the same hours as the disabled partner, if the disabled person can't work, than have the carer claiming carers allowence and not working at all.",
