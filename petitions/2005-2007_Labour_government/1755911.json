        "background": "My idea is this:  that we have an accountable government that is controlled by its people 'realtime'. We don't leave it up to corrupt MPs/PMs that are paid too much, we 'the people' make the votes, all the time about everything.  How can this be done? By phone during primetime news by TV district, not on the same day of course as this would clog the lines. If the government can listen to 'at least' 250k phones every second with 'echelon'(this can be searched on the web and the truth about government eavesdropping can be discovered) they can take as many votes. This would of course save millions, wast no time and effect legislation sooner. We also wouldn't need to take time out during the week to vote. Or is that planned do you think?",
