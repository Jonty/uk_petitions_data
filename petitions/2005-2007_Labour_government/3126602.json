        "background": "in the US  one can buy small cell phone jammers that work over quite a short distance (say one room).  I believe these are at present illegal in this country since they include some radio transmission.  However, it is not hard to think of genuinely useful things to do with them, for instance stopping pupils cheating in exams; and because of their small range they would not be a potential menace.",
