            "background": "tony blair is the best prime minister britain has had in a long time. although his legacy may be tarnished by iraq, he has still done lots of other good things. what has happened is that tony blair has been bullied into resigning by gordon brown, who looks like the most boring persdon in the world. and as gordon brown isnt very popular david cameron will probably become the next pm. now can you ever see him having as good as relations with the usa as labour has and can you ever see him doing anything that doesnt benefit the environment or include riding a bike. so sign the petition and keep tony blairv in power.",
