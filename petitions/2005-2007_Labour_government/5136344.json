            "background": "With these talks of the police being able to stop and quiz people in regards to \"terrorism\" it seems increasingly clear that we're treading a very fine line between wanted to protect ourselves and spiralling into a dictorship. Ordinary people would be \"criminalised\" by this act as if they didn't tell the police where they had been or what they were doing they could be fined up to \u00a35,000 and the fact of the matter is that most who are going to be stopped are probably those who can least afford it. I realise that its probably not what is intended but that is what will happen; like in Nazi Germany, it started with an act of terrorism and then certain groups started losing their liberties until it resulted in genocide.\n\n\"When the Nazis came for the communists,\nI remained silent;\nI was not a communist.\n\nWhen they locked up the social democrats,\nI remained silent;\nI was not a social democrat.\n\nWhen they came for the trade unionists,\nI did not speak out;\nI was not a trade unionist.\n\nWhen they came for me,\nthere was no one left to speak out.\"",
