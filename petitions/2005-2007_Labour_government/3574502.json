            "background": "Shocking dolphin hunt images released by ITV 6.15, Tue Feb 27 2007\n\nShocking images have emerged of a brutal yet legal dolphin drive hunt in Japan.\n\nDespite being considered one of the most gentle and intelligent creatures on the planet, thousands of dolphins are still captured or killed every year.\n\nThe drive hunts see hundreds of the mammals chased, rounded up and slaughtered over a period of hours or even days, while others are dragged away to be sold for up to $100,000 each to marine parks around the world.\n\nThousands of the creatures are killed this way each year and suffer extensive pain and distress in the process.\n\nThe hunts have been widely criticised by organisations, such as the International Whaling Commission, which fear that local dolphin populations could disappear completely if the hunts continue.\n\nIt is hoped that by applying international pressure the Japanese Government will cease such brutality.",
