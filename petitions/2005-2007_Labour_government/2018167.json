The \"Cold War\" was not just an ideological struggle, it was a large-scale military campaign to prevent a third world war through deterrence and military deployments. While many characterize the period 1945-1991 as \"peacetime,\" except for limited wars and expeditions, this misses the point of the large, ongoing military operation that was in fact global.\nMany other expeditions also took place in the cold war context. In the larger context, our defence effort included troop deployments to check Soviet military threats, continuous nuclear-armed retaliatory capability in event of a Soviet attack, and reconnaissance of hostile territory and waters by air and sea. Air Defence sites provided a deterrent against Soviet attack of the United Kingdom, and were kept on a high state of alert",
