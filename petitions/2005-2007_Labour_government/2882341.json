        "background": "British soldiers risking death in Afghanistan and Iraq are being paid about half the national minimum wage.The troops, facing daily attacks in Helmand and Basra, and suffering a rising toll of dead and injured, are among Britain's lowest paid workers. The average salary of a newly qualified soldier is \u00a314,300 before tax - compared with about \u00a320,000 for a police officer. In a combat zone, being on duty for a minimum of 16 hours gives the troops an hourly rate of \u00a32.45. There is also a longer service separation allowance of about \u00a36 a day, but this only applies to those who have served at least 12 months away from home. This is well below the current national minimum wage of \u00a3 5.05 an hour, which is due to rise to \u00a35.35. In reality the figures for soldiers' earnings are even worse.",
