            "background": "If you abolih road tax and increase the duty on fuel to compensate, it would mean the more you use your car the more you would pay, its unfair that someone who drives only around 10,000 miles per year is charged the same someone who might drive 50,000 per year, surely the more miles you drive the more you should pay towards the up-keep of our road system, to add another 10p per litre of fuel would ensure high milage users would pay for the road miles they use, it's not fair that small mileage users paid the same has high mileage people",
