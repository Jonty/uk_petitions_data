            "background": "If Tony Blair is quite happy to have Fundamental Christian schools (like Gateshead), teaching Intelligent Design as scientific fact, in the interest of diversity.  Then surely Ancient mythology, the existence of vampires, ghosts, zombies, Unicorns, pixies, fairies, The Flying Spaghetti Monster, reincarnation, celestial teapots and any other supernatural occurences that exists on the basis of faith; should be given equal time during our science lessons.  Science should be dealing with the basic Scientific method, based on observable, empirical, measurable evidence based on reason and with reapeatable experimentation from nuetral third parties.  Science is not because somebody said so in a book 2000 years ago, that is philosophy and theology.  There is nothing wrong with ID being taught to children in RE, but not as scientific fact.",
