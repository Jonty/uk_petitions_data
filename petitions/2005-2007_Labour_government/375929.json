            "background": "At present many rail companies are conducting ticket checking as passengers leave stations, particularly at major stations. This causes queues to leave the platform, and delays commuters on their way to work. \n\nMore importantly it makes the rest of the rail journey less safe. Many smaller stations are left unstaffed and thus less safe. Peak hour trains can be overcrowded to the point that a conductor cannot travel along the carriages to check and sell tickets.\n\nYet as things stand, train companies which have no concern for the safety of passengers during their journey are still able to take the full fare price upon arrival at the destination.\n\nIf the train operating companies want their money, let them run a railway that has adequate staffing throughout and sufficient carriages for passenger demand. We should not be rewarding rail firms which cut corners.",
