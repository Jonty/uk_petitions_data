            "background": "As a British and United States citizen I request that HMS PLymouth be granted a permanent berth. This ship has been juggled around like a hot potatoe. First at Plymouth , then to Scotland then back to Birkenhead. Time out - this ships amateur radio was operated by the the Royal Naval Amateur Radio Society for which I am a Life long member # 0926.It gave countless hours of enjoyment to members who live overseas in Canada United States and Australia and New Zealand. Even Port Stanley in the falklands was great to contact from the United States. It's a shame and insult to all those that served in the RN  to witness the demise and break up of such a gallant ship.I encourage all overseas members to sign this petition",
