        "background": "Cars are sold in this country, and a big factor in purchase with some people is the top speed. With a speed limit of 70mph, we do not need cars at all to exceed this.\nI propose instead of spending huge amounts of cash on traffic tracking, to use the cash to improve safety by ensuring all cars are fitted with regulators not to exceed 70mph. To extend this, it may be possible to make cars change their maximum when the encounter a change in speed limit, possibly done via GPS or radio transmissions. The technology is there, lets improve safety and scrap the obsession with 150mph car top speed figures.",
