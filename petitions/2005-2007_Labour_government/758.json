            "background": "By allowing only women to take maternity leave, this country continues to discriminate against men who may wish to be the 'active parent' in their child's earliest years. Also it provides companies with a reason (Legal or illegal) not to recruit and promote women, because they are seen as more likely to leave the company to raise children. Allowing either the mother or the father of a child to take maternity leave would level the playing field for men and women in the workplace.",
