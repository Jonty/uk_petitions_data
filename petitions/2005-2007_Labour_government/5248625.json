            "background": "4x4 vehicles most certainly have their uses.  Driving the kids to school is not one of them.  While people with more money than sense blindly and selfishly enjoy their increased ride comfort, visibility and sense of own personal safety in urban environments they increase, for everyone else, levels of pollution, number and severity of collisions with pedestrians and rate of depletion of our limited resources of fossil fuels -- all relative to the same journeys taken in a more conventional car.  Raising road tax on such vehicles is inadequate to prevent affluent people using their 4x4 vehicles in urban environments and is unfair to justified 4x4 users in non-urban environments.",
