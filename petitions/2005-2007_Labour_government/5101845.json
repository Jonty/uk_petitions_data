            "background": "This petition is to stop the government from making local councils introduce yet another charge on top of the already high council tax bill to collect our refuse and recycling.\n\nThis is to meet yet another burrecratic law that the EU is to bring in 2010.  No doubt we will be only EU counrty who falls over and excepts this, while watching other EU countries flout the laws!!\n\nIf the government and local councils spent more time providing adequate recycling facilities, that were managed efficiently, there would not be this need.\n\nWe need to get as many people to sign this petition, while the environmental guru, David Milliband, is carrying out his so called public consultation.",
