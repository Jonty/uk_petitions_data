            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current situation where children learn about religion in schools taught as fact is wholly wrong and should be stopped immediately.  Children do not have the mental capacity to determine fact from fiction, therefore teaching religion as fact is unethical, and should only happen as a matter of subject choice in secondary schools when young adults have had an opportunity to fully understand our place in the Universe.\n\nThe idea of religious children should be unacceptable to all reasonable people who believe in freedom of choice and who themselves may have been forced to participate in a religious lifestyle as a child, which they have, in later life, objected to.\nThe separation of religion and state needs to start from a much younger age.",
