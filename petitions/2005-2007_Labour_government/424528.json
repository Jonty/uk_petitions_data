            "background": "The weight of increase in population caused by mass immigration into the UK is forcing our island to sink into the sea.  This is evident by the rise in sea level around the UK and the increase in coastal erosion. We ask that the government should recognise this issue is caused by their policies and not climate change! \n\nThe upside of this directive would be that all immigrants could fill their buckets with fresh water in Europe - so on arrival here, they can give it Southern Water to alleviate the drought - particularly in Kent.\n\nThank you.",
