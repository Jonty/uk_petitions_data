        "background": "Women are discriminated against for a further 5 years after retirement, in that they do not get the increased personal allowance at 60 when they retire but at 65 the age that men retire.\nGender equality is allowed for prescriptions and other charges but does not translate to pensions.\nThis means that should you have saved for your pension, you will still pay tax as if you were working even though your income has reduced, but your costs have stayed the same or increased with inflation.\nIt is time that equality applied to all benefits including pensions.",
