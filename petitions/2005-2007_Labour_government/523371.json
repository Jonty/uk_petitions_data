            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is submitted that whilst local authorities have a duty to those who are homeless and seek assistance, current practice does not reflect the law. Authorities are under pressure to reduce the number of applications made by people as homeless. \n\nThis often results in people not being informed of their right to make a homelessness application. Many vulnerable people believe (in error) that the local authority discharges their duty to them by placing them on a register for housing rather than taking a homelessness application. \n\nThe main method of challenging a failure or delay in taking a homelessness application is by way of judicial review which is a drawn out process and of particular difficulty for those living outside of London where access to good, free housing advice/representation is limited. \n\nThe petitioners call upon the Prime Minister to write to local authorities emphasising the need to comply with the law and good practice.",
