        "background": "by applying the same \"common farming policy\" as operates in europe for the farmers in afganistan, all the poppy crop would be purchased by the central intervention board thus cutting out the crooks and taliband and giving the growers a fixed price for their crop.\nthe farmers would obtain a sustainable livleyhood (like our own farmers when we had the butter and barley mountains). the board would store, process or destroy the crop as appropriate and over time different farming could be introduced. \nthis would cost a lot less in lives and currency and give the afgans a future.",
