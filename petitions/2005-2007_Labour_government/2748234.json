        "background": "Lets stop looking at the NHS as something worth keeping because it is not. The people who benefit from it the most are the politicians, and those who contribute nothing to it. The average working person would get a better service at a much lower cost if we abolished the NHS and replaced it with a similar service to those found in France or Germany for example. Look at your wage slip this month and see how much you are actually paying for the NHS. In most cases you will be paying 2 or 3 times what other Europeans are paying for a better service. The wool is being pulled over our eyes, the NHS is UNFAIR. Why in the 60 years or so since it started has no other country adopted the same scheme? Abolish the NHS and replace it with something similar to the French or German schemes.",
