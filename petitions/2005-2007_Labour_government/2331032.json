In recent weeks he has been quoted as saying it has been an honour to lead the British people. We would like to petition Mr Blair to remember that he is a public servant, in the service of the British people and as such is a servant to the public of the United Kingdom. He is here to serve us, not 'lead' us (what ever that means). He should know his place.",
