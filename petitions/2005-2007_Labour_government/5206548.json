        "background": "The current offering of the London 2012 Olympics Logo is woeful and has all the design flair and thought applied to it's creation that a 3 year old would do.\nFor such a monumental occasion and event, the logo is so below par it would be laughable if it was not such a serious matter.\nIn no way, shape, or form, does the logo do anything to convey London nor The Olympics, even allowing for the registered trademark of the four overlapped rings.\nWhomever signed off on this as worthy of the expenditure (not to mention the accompanying video trailer) needs sacking and never allowed to authorise the like of again.\nThe fact the numbers require deciphering is probably the grossest aspect of the design.\nAs a result, the design ought to be re-tendered, and something more befitting of the UK, as a whole, chosen in place of the current ill-conceived one.",
