Hoodies would now be safely tucked up at home with a nice tube of E numbered chocolates instead of mini-motoing over mr patel and his family if blue smarties were here.\n\nThe absortion of blue light into blue smarties away from the atmosphere is clinically proven to reduce the effects of premature planet destruction. And wrinkles.\n\nAnd lest us not forget, driving standards would improve 10 fold. Though I've yet to work out how.",
