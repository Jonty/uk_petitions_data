            "background": "For those assylum seekers who travel to this country to claim off the benefits and tax payers money, they should work for this country before we give any hand outs free of charge. This would cut down on the number of assylum seekers entering and then dissapearing if they are put straight into a national service scheme. For those youths who find it big and hard to carry knives and dangerous weapons on our streets, let them be taught like our grand fathers and mothers were taught. They have more respect for this world than the now youths of our communities, plus had a more pleasant atmosphere not only to live in, but to bring now young children into. Lets SORT THIS COUNTRY OUT, BEFORE THE PROBLEMS OF TODAY BECOME TO OUT OF CONTROL, THAT THIS COUNTRY WILL SOON BE KNOW AS \"THIRD WORLD COUNTRY\".",
