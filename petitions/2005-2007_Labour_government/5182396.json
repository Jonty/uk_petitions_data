            "background": "Many companies have helplines that charge a premium price when you call them to fix their errors, such as billing you incorrectly. Since these helplines normally keep you on hold for 20 minutes before the phone is answered these companies make a small fortune by keeping their customers waiting.\n\nTherefore all helplines should be free to encourage companies to promptly resolve their customers' problems, thus incurring a lesser cost. These helplines should not be subsidied with the taxpayer's money because that would defeat the whole purpose of making the company pay for their own helplines.",
