        "background": "The United Kingdom was recently placed bottom of a UNICEF league table of 21 economically developed nations for child well-being. The UK was even put to shame in certain areas by developing countries. The report indicates that Britain is failing it children miserably. This country, being economically well placed, should not be allowing its youth to become alienated. Drug abuse, teenage pregnancies, physical abuse, ill-health and dis-satisfaction with the education system is not acceptable for our children. Our children are our future, even more important than the war on terror and many other things currently occupying the governments attention.",
