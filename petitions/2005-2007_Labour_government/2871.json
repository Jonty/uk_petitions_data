Creating media focus that are not in the public interest and have lead to ongoing national security endeavours being compromised.\n\nYes, the media have a duty to inform the public of newsworthy information but that should not include charecter and organisational assassination which is tantamount to subversion of the state.\n\nWe live in different times in the 21st century and sensitive matters of state and security should be afforded greater protections from the foolhardy reporting by media elements.\n\nWho is with me?",
