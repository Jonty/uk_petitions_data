        "action": "legislate to require homeowners to turn off festive light displays during daylight and after 12 midnight, to require businesses to turn off illuminated signage during summer daylight hours and after 12 midnight in order to reduce energy consumption, greenhouse gas production, potential global warming and reduce light polution",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It seems to myself (as a lay person) that there are many shop signs that are left illuminated during the nightime hours that no-one needs to be able to view, so why not enforce a ban on having them illuminated after midnight (when 90% of the population are safetly in bed) and thus reduce the energy consumption of the whole country, thus helping to reduce carbon emissions and potential global warming issues. \n\nA further step forwards would be to prohibit the displays of domestic, corporate or council 'festive' light displays after midnight or during daylight hours, as they are often left on for long periods when they serve no real purpose at all.\n\nTo take another further step, perhaps dialogue could be started on turning off unused streetlights after 1am in rural areas. Thus also reducing light polution as well as energy consumption.",
