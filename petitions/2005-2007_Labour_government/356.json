        "background": "The roadworks on the M1 between Junction 10 and 8 cause massive delays during peak travel and I've seen  traffic hold ups off peak, sometimes  at 5am in the morning. \n\nThese delays are expected to last into 2008.\n\nRail travel in and out of London from outlying towns like Rugby is just not an option with excessive rail fares costing considerably more than the cost of fuel the journey from Rugby to London (69 miles) takes for the average car.\n\nTen miles of continuous roadworks on one stretch of the main north south highway in the UK is just unprecedented.\n\nCan this development have been thought out properly?\n\nPlease have a review of the M1 road widening scheme and if it can't be done in smaller sections then review the work and create 3 lanes in sections that have a faster speed limit than ten miles of hold ups.",
