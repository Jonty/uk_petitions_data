            "background": "This issue has bothered me for some time. While public transport is being touted as the solution to urban congestion, the pollution from the nations bus fleet is quite frankly deplorable. In my home town of Barnstaple buses are unquestionably the most polluting vehicles on the road.\n\n In one of the world most developed countrys I cannot think of a single reason why this is acceptable, Indeed the smoke clouds i see eminating from buses are more befiting of a third world banana republic than a technologicaly advanced nation. This is in stark contrast to a country like the netherlands where buses run on LPG and are quiet and clean.\n\nConsider British children (many of whom travel to school by bus) walking away from the bus stop through a cloud of diesel smoke, the toxicity of which is well proven. What kind of start in life is this? And is this acceptable in a modern society? I think not... How about you?\n\nPlease respond.\n\nregards\nmark rice",
