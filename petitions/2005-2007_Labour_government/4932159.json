            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Increase statutory holiday by 4 days; eradicate the 4 bank holidays Easter Monday; 1st of May; last Mondays of May and August.  There is widespread traffic chaos on these four days. Under this proposal, the burden on the roads, rail and airports will be spread more evenly over the year; people in work will have flexibility to choose when to take free time;  holiday companies will be deprived of a further reason to hike prices at key times; national productivity will be subject to fewer \u201cfits and starts\u201d; internationally active companies will remain in sync with customers abroad; the national wage bill (and taxation revenue) will be lower as 4 days are paid at the standard rate rather than the higher Bank Holiday rate. Potential losers are those who choose to work on bank holidays for premium rates and those who enjoy the particular quaint flavour of the summer bank holidays.  Thorough implementation would be needed to ensure that unscrupulous employers do not exploit vulnerable staff.",
