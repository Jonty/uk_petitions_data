        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Too many wards run with the minimum safe level of nursing staff which is fine till one gets sent home sick. Some wards have housekeepers only for a few hours per day and that can't possibly allow for proper cleaning which then falls to the nursing staff which already have their hands full covering their sick colleague. Then you have the situation where a class of midwives qualify and can't get jobs when the ward sisters are telling them they'd love to have the budget to employ a couple more staff which leads to 18hr a week posts for ten months after 3 years of training. Give the cash to the troops the morale will improve, the care will get better and the bugs will be beaten. Thank you.",
