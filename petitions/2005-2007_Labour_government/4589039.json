        "background": "As Registered Nurses who often work (with other healthcare professionals) beyond our contracted hours for the good of our patients and ensure that the NHS is supported and often carried reaching targets in patient care and those set by Government at a national level we ask the Prime Minister to follow the promise of Frank Dobson that staged pay rises will never again occur under labour. Patricia Hewitt has reneged on this. This is a blatent lie and the RCN congress , with the voice of the RN's will have a major say in the future government of the UK. WE WILL NOT STRIKE, BUT THAT DOES NOT MEAN OUR VOICES ARE UNHEARD.",
