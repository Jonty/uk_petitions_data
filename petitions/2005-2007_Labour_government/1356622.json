            "background": "Councils are considering \"smart bins\" which identify the house they belong to when weighed on a bin truck. Households would then be charged (on top of council tax) for non-recycled rubbish they throw away, to help councils meet landfill reduction targets.  But most people with incomes lower than about \u00a3100,000 a year (much more in London/SE) live in areas where not everyone is perfectly honest.  Short of taking time off work to stand guard over their bins on collection day, these people will have no way of stopping the dishonest from dumping in other people's bins, so shifting yet another cost onto the shoulders of decent people.  Unless and until this can be stopped, smart bins or any charging by weight should be prohibited.",
