            "background": "The Education Dept should take a leaf out of educational systems that are working far more efficiently, such as Scandinavia or Germany, and involve the students directly, and seriously, into the running of the schools, the curriculum, and indeed every aspect of the schools to which they are forced to attend.\n\nThis will reduce the conflict between the students and the teachers/school authorities, and involve them far more in their own education.\n\nThis is the only way to reduce the incredible level of violence that is surging up within our schools, and will also prepare students properly for life within a democratic nation, where they are also expected to take an interest and have a voice over how things are run.\n\nWe must move forward to a democratic participatory society, not backwards into medieval force and violence. It is not only our children that deserve no less, it is for the survival of our society and culture.",
