            "background": "I believe that the government should force employers and colleges to recognise apprentices as workers and members of their company and pay them according to their job and not their title.\n\nI am currently an Advanced Modern Apprentice who has already completed a years apprenticeship in Business Administration.  Whilst on my FMA I got paid a poor \u00a345 a week for doing the same work as other members of my placement staff who got more than the NMW.\n\nI am now in the role of trainee manager and because I am only in the first year of my apprenticeship I am not entitled to NMW despite the fact I have a years training!  If the Government wishes to encourage people to complete vocational qualifications they should encourage employers to pay better.\n\nIf you agree that modern apprentices should be paid a fair amount for doing the same work as their counterparts, sign this petition.  You do not have to be or have been an apprentice to realise this is not fair!",
