            "background": "The journey to school should not be a difficult and sometimes dangerous one for families who choose the healthy, environmentally sound option of walking.  Young children should not have to risk their lives by crossing roads busy with vehicles, or be forced into the road by cars parked on pavements outside their school.  Their health and our planet should not be damaged by car fumes either.\n\nBy taxing the school-run for able-bodied people, preventing parking anywhere near any school premises and rewarding those that walk this can be achieved. A Green point scheme where schools can be rewarded with games equipment or similar would discourage the use of cars too.",
