        "background": "Every single day the public face difficulties trying to find food without the gelling agent, Gelatine inside. Gelatine is a translucent brittle solid substance, colourless or slightly yellow, nearly tasteless and odorless which is used in the disgusting manufacture of Children's sweets. Vegetarian or not, the public must not be happy knowing that they are / their children are eating boiled animal connective tissue; bones, ligaments, cartilage and tendons. As a vegetarian, I find it almost impossible to find children's sweets without this ridiculous substance inside! 'But why', I hear myself ask, when there are vegetarian options such as Agar-Agar, Arrowroot Gum, etc etc. \nI ask you to please sign the petition to show you care about what you are eating and how animals suffer so you can do so. I have already written to the Prime Minister about this matter, but I would just like to show that there are more people in this country that care. And perhaps, once he hears of this, the government will take action.\nThank you, Sophie Mayes.",
