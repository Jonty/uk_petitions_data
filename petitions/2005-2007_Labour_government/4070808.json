            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We have established that it is legal for a taxpayer's income tax return to be altered by a civil servant for the purpose of opening a tax enquiry. We believe there is a loophole in the Taxes Management Act which denies taxpayers the right to appeal against an in depth enquiry and this includes cases where H M Revenue & Customs (HMR&C) have made a mistake. HMR&C consider that it is legal to open an in depth investigation into a taxpayer's self assessment return in cases where HMR&C have erroneously entered and captured false information and based their selection on figures which they may or may not know to be false. HMR&C advises that there is presently no right to appeal to the General or Special Commissioners and that once the Section 9a Notice is issued the enquiry must proceed through to a settlement. HMR&C and their staff should not be dealing with tainted evidence in legal proceedings which may be detrimental to the reputation of the civil service and the government and also to avoid the risk of large sums of taxpayers money being wasted. The right to appeal against such a notice will avail both the taxpayer and HMR&C the opportunity to correct errors cost effectively.",
