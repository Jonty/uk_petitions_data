            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "To improve the efficiency of vehicle driving, manufacturers should be made to apply markings, say a green zone, to the rev counter of all new vehicles at which the engine is running at its most efficient. Another set of markings, say the amber zone, would denote the engine running inefficiently. The existing markings, or red zone, denoting harmful engine use would remain.\nAt present, the manufacturers test data giving mpg figures and co2 emissions figures are not easliy replicated or understood. Providing these zones for guidance would help and with careful marketing and inclusion within the Highway Code, the driving skills of the nation could be improved. This would help limit the emissions from engines and the damage caused to the environment. A saving in fuel use would also result helping families on low incomes in particular.",
