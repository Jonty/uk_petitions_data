The current law is that no one under the age of 16 can purchase the Morning After Pill from a chemist, I personally think this is very wrong. Children under 16 are more sexually active than ever before, and there will be some who have unprotected sex. We should be helping them by providing them with the Morning After Pill instead of preventing them from been able to get it. Surely it is better to sell them a pill instead of having another unwanted teenage pregnancy?",
