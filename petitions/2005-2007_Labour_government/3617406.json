            "background": "Most football fans share the fond memory of standing on terraces to watch their teams play & class this as the most fundamental tradition of watching football. All seated stadia can detract from the experience many fans anticipate & most would welcome a return to terraces, to take part in the true experience of a football match & to counteract ever decreasing attendances & atmosphere at games. All seated arena & over-pricing have contributed to the lack of events & facilities for society\u2019s youth who at one time could attend matches as previous generations have. Football may no longer be a working class game, but it is this working class fan base that established & supported football from the start & they can no longer be priced out of attending matches. Safety fears can be easily addressed by maintaining the policy of ticket only games, thus retaining full control on over-crowding.",
