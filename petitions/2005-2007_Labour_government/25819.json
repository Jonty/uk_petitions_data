            "background": "Local government has been subject to far too much tinkering, target setting and control by central government for decades.  If government is by the consent of the governed then surely that consent, for local affairs, is given in elections to local councillors.  Instead of handing down a menu from on high of how local government will be permitted to operate, allow real innovation and local consultation to decide how to run and fund their local communities.",
