        "action": "immediately repeal the recent announcement of increased detention without evidence presented in a Court of Law",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Gordon Brown, the Prime Minister in waiting, recently announced that he intends to bring in powers to detain anybody for 90 days (3 months) without trial.  This decision should immediately be withdrawn for the following reasons:\n\n* Such powers could be horribly misused to detain innocent citizens\n\n* Any person who is considered a threat should be able to be brought to trial within the current 30 day period\n\n* History teaches us that when far-reaching powers are approved, regimes abuse them for their own means.\n\n\nA justification from the BBC's message boards:\n\nMy kids are taught in school about fascist Germany, presumably to prevent it happening to a new generation. And here we are slipping into the same kind of regime where people are locked up without charge, detained indefinitely on the mere suspicion of plotting against the state... and shot dead by police who are not held to account. All you have to do is change the word 'Jew' for 'Terrorist' and you have all the justification you need for fascist Britain.",
