        "background": "Many people are moderate earners but are caught within the 40% tax band, this limit should be raised and a new tax band of 50% introduced for those earning over \u00a390,000 per year. This extra tax raised should be then ring fenced and ploughed back into essential services, NHS, Schools and care for the elderly. This allows the elderly some dignity in later life without the fear of losing their homes",
