            "background": "Most towns have a public car park which is used by commuters in the week, but is underused at weekends. Local organisations should be able to book this to hold fund raising car boot sales, to enable them to raise much needed funds, and to encourage the Re - use part of the Recycling triangle. Some towns and cities already do this, it needs to be extended nationwide.",
