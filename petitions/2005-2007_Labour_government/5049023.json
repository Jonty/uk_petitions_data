            "background": "Soft drinks such as coke, fanta, 7up etc. etc. are usually post-mix drinks and cost pennies per litre to make. Why is then that public houses often charge more for these drinks than the alternative beverages they also provide?? This is a clear example of gross profiteering and is contributing towards the drinking culture within our society. We would like to see the price range of these drinks in public houses reduced to typical shop prices.",
