            "background": "The UK use to be a nation of animal lovers but animal cruelty is on the rise. We need to teach our youth respect for our animals. I suggest we create a new lesson for all years of junior school (infants would be too young and high school already has too many lessons) this lesson would teach our youth respect for our animals. The lesson could include teaching kids about all of the UK's animals, food chains, what animals we use for food, how to care for animals, illegal animal trade, endangerd animals, animal cruelty, types of animals, animal habbitats est. this could not only stop the rising violence to animals but could encourage kids to take jobs as vets est. The lesson could even include taking the kids to trips like zoo's, animal care centres, farms (which is a great opertunity say for london kids who mostly never see a farm in their life time). The RSPCA could also give visits to the schools.",
