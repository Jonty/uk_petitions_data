            "background": "I have written to my M.P. on many occasions regarding this subject. I feel it is wrong, having worked for 50 plus years, to be penalised financially, for receiving a goverment pension, which added to a small works pesion, takes me in the taxation class. I cannot see the government seriously losing out, financially, by increasing the personal tax allowance for pensioners. I would therefore petition this government, to increase the personal tax allowance for pensioners, if not in the next budget,then, within the period left to them in office.",
