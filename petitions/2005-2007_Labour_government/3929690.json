        "background": "As someone who was fairly well on line with the status quo on Global Warming, to the extent I have fitted a Ground Source Heat Pump to my home, I found the arguments put forward by the Chanel 4 program to be eloquent and intelligent and convincing.  Quoting eminent scientists, the co-founder of Greenpeace and a former Chancellor of the Exchequor.  It seems that the science community 'may' have found it's great cash cow with global warming issue.  The program and it's scientists claim that changes in the sun causes global warming and cooling and that through history rising co2 levels have consistantly FOLLOWED raised temperatures not caused them.  The program also gave an example of a scientist who was consulted on the EU's report which cited 250 of the worlds Top Scientists, who strongly dissagreed with its findings.  They however were determind to keep his name on the list.  He had to threaten to take them to court to have his name removed.",
