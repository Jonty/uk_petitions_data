            "background": "currently Norwich City Council only has juristiction over the City area, but there are plans which give them control over the surrounding councils such as Broadland. We are opposed as most of the councils due to be taken over are more efficient than Norwich City Council, and there would also be an increase in council taxes. We therefore propose that should Norwich City Council wish to gain unitary status it should first increase its efficiency and constituent satisfaction.",
