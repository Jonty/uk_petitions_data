            "background": "Manliness is not braggadocio. It is stoicism, self-respect, decisiveness, assertiveness. Throughout history, especially in the ancient cultures, boys would undergo many different, sometimes dangerous, ceremonies or sacrifices in order to be recognized as adult in their own right. This rite of passage from childhood to adulthood was very important to these emerging members of society, and many factors of their adult life would sometimes have been affected by this one transitional period of a male person's life.\n\nMasculinity has its roots in social constructions and genetics. Therefore while masculinity can mean different things to different cultures, there are often common aspects to its definition across cultures. Sometimes gender scholars will use the phrase \"hegemonic masculinity\" to distinguish the most dominant form of masculinity from other variants.",
