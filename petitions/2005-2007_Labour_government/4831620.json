Stop this money grabbing man taking all our money.  Its not fair on single home owners like myself earning \u00a316,500 paying child support and after bills having \u00a3200-\u00a3300 left in a month to get food petrol etc living in a 2 bed terraced.  My garden is my only pretty thing I can look at.",
