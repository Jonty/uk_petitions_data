            "background": "An elected House of Lords (Peers) will rival to the Commons - repeating the mistakes of Scotland in having both constituency and non-constituency members.\n\nThe benefit of the Lords is its expertise, crossbenchers, decent independence from political party control (whips etc), and ability to purposely represent under represented groups and in nearly every way be different to the House of Commons. Even partial election would destroy this to everyone\u2019s loss.\n\nBy having an independent appointments commission (not parties) selecting and utilising a similar process as that used for statutory instruments (a final check and balance) we could enjoy a House of youthful, specialist, pragmatic and dynamic individuals who can bring something to our legislative process and government oversight elected persons never could.\n\nWe know elected doesn't mean better - reform the Lords not destroy it. Independently appoint to keep our democracy strong in the face of party political fallacies.",
