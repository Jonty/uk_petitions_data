            "background": "The Theatre Royal is the second oldest theatre in the UK and has the oldest stage.  Thanet District Council have told the theatre that unless they sell it them, and let the stage be ripped out so that it can be used as a community arts venue, they will refuse all further applications for grants. All meetings have taken place behind closed doors and there has been no public consultation.  The Theatre currently has a full programme, including theatre workshops, school theatre and other community theatre as well as commercial productions.  It regularly sells out and has just had the most successful pantomime season, without a z list celebrity in sight! THIS MUST BE STOPPED",
