            "background": "The full background and justification for this petition are set out in Patrick Haseldine's Wikipedia article. We believe that Patrick Haseldine was wrongfully dismissed from HM Diplomatic Service on 2 August 1989, having written a letter that was published in the Guardian newspaper on 7 December 1988. His sacking, and prior suspension for six months for appearing on BBC TV's \"Question Time\" on 25 February 1988, clearly constitute interferences with his Article 10 right to freedom of expression. Accordingly, Haseldine should be paid not only ex gratia compensation (on a par with the out-of-court settlement made in February 2006 to former Scottish police detective, Shirley McKie - see her eponymous Wikipedia article) but also a significantly enhanced FCO pension.",
