We believe that extending the Student Loans Scheme to postgraduates, thereby allowing students to defer the current up-front cost of postgraduate study, will benefit those undertaking postgraduate study and society through those able to access funding.  A deferred payment scheme would support those not able to obtain funding and support the completion of postgraduate study for those who wish to undertake it.",
