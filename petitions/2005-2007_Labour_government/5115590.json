There is not always \na constant supply.\n\n\"There are no doctors or nurses, no medical outposts.\n\n\"I wish to settle in the UK to have better access to medication, care \nand support.\"\n\nHe has to travel from his mountain home to the Gurkha camp at Pokhara \nonce a month to collect his pension.\n\nIt involves a day\u2019s walk and he has to be carried in a basket by several men.",
