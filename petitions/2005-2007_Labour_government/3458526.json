        "background": "Inheritance tax initially seems to be an unfair tax until you research its history. It was the absence of inheritance tax that enabled a small group of families in the not too distant past to grow richer and richer through the generations until they had all the money and all the power. inheritance tax redistributes this wealth back into the community. Would you want your children to grow up in a country where the \"Lord of the Manor\" would be the only employer and employed everyone in the district (if you behaved) How long you would work and decided how much you were to be paid. Anyone who knows a bit about the history of this country will vote to keep inheritance tax.",
