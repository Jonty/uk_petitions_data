Having experienced at first had the poor service the local police provide which I believe is due to their being unable to properly train their staff because of the small size of the constabulary and the remoteness of our nearest police station. I wish there to be a public enquiry into the future of Law and Order in Warwickshire aimed at dramatically improving the situation in the rural villages possible by merging with a larger police force who are able to deal with serious crimes.",
