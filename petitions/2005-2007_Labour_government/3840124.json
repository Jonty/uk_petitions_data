            "background": "The 1981 NIA allowed British women to pass citizenship to their foreign-born children, not including children born before the passage of the Act. The 2002 Act allows the foreign-born children of British women born after 7 Feb 1961 to register as citizens. As those born before that date can not register, they are clearly being discriminated against due to their age, while their mothers are being discriminated against due to their gender since British men can pass on their citizenship no matter when their child was born. Simply because of birthdates, some foreign-born children of British women STILL aren\u2019t eligible for citizenship, whilst some are. We feel it is time for the government to alter its policy and remove the age and gender discrimination in the 2002 NIA. This can be done by simply removing the cut-off date, or by allowing anyone with a British-born mother and grandparent leave to remain in the UK, opening a path to citizenship that their younger counterparts already have.",
