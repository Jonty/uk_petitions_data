In the UK you will pay around \u00a3220 for the Home premium version of Vista, but in America you could pick up the same software for $230.00 (\u00a3115). The same applies to many software houses; and download sites. The country is per capita more wealthy, yet we have to pay sometimes in excess of 100% more for the same product.",
