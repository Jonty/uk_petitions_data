        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The amount of space that could be utilised above major cities is tremendous. Tall buildings, not just newly built ones but all buildings with 4 floors or more, should be fitted with one or more devices such as small scale wind turbines and solar panels which will help put energy back into the grid, giving us a big leap towards our environmental responsibilities and a positive step towards sorting out global issues (&cheaper enery for us). All industrial estates should have at least one large scale wind turbine which would go towards making them less of an eye sore as well as providing greener energy.The emphasis seems nowadays to be on private house owners fitting their homes with such devices which is fair enough but what about the big city companies doing something for the environment by small alterations to their buildings. Imagine if 50% of buildings were fitted with devices the amount of energy which could be supplied back to the grid from one city alone.",
