            "background": "In many European countries, traffic lights are switched to flashing amber during the night time.  Motorists are then required to abide by road markings which establish who has to give way.  Flashing amber reduces CO2 emissions, improves traffic flow and reduces driver frustration.\n\nCO2 Reduction:  \nFlashing amber uses less than half the electricity of standard traffic lights.  \nVehicles do not unnecessarily sit in a queue when there is no traffic coming \"the other way\".  Vehicles progressing down the main route do not have to stop.\n\nImproved traffic flow:  \nVehicles can proceed when the road is clear, allowing better road use.\nUnnecessary queues are eliminated.\n\nReduced Driver Frustration:  \nDrivers will no longer have to sit waiting at lights when the road is clear.\nControl is handed back to the driver, which will give a better sense of wellbeing.",
