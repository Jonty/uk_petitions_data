            "background": "Plans to create a congestion charging zone in Greenwich would unfairly penalise Greenwich and Blackheath residents, who, according to a recent report, could be expected to pay between 10 and 100% of the charge.  \n\nPlans to cut congestion in the area could be achieved equally well by charging a toll for the Blackwall Tunnel alone without the need for a wider congestion charging zone in the town centre.  \n\nThe TFL sponsored survey (unsurprisingly) does not give residents an option to oppose the scheme, but merely to choose between two alternatives.",
