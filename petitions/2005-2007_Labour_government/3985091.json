            "background": "The present system of Criminal Records Bureau checks whilst welcome and crucial for safeguarding vulnerable children and adults creates significant delays and extra work for organisations of all sizes wishing to recruit staff and volunteers\n\nIt is suggested that an individual be responsible for obtaining their own CRB check which would be valid for any organisation over a set period. The fee could be reclaimed if the person was on benefits or organisations could agree to contribute to an individuals cost.\n\nThe government should agree to contribute to encourage involvement in volunteering and community groups, professionals such as nurses could have a CRB check as a requirement for registration thus ensuring the process is complete before they qualify.",
