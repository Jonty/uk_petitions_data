        "background": "Once every 5 years this country is a democracy. Then, and only then can we vote to indicate our support for one party's policies. This is the general election. For the remaining 5 years of a government's tenure the people no longer have any say in a meaningful sense in how the country is run. A mechanism is required by which we can remove a government who fail to implement the policies on which they are elected, or which introduce objectionable policies that were not declared at the time of the election.",
