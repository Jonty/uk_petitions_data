The council said the applicant had failed to justify the principle of the development in terms of the site.\n\nIt also suggested that the use of the proposed buildings and site would have \"a materially significant adverse effect on neighbour amenity in terms of noise and disturbance\".\n\nDavid Philpott, chief executive of the Surrey Air Ambulance, said the council's decision had left him \"astounded\". \"I am unaware of any such planning application ever being rejected elsewhere in the UK.\u201d\n\nThe air ambulance service had hoped to start flying by next month. The helicopter would be able to attend an incident anywhere in Surrey and Sussex. It should be given permission to base at Dunsfold Park so that lives can be saved!",
