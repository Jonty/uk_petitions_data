I don't see why they should object to me using imperial measures.\nI'm happy to buy a lb of cheese or a pint of beer, and don't see why I shouldn't. \nModern electronic scales, and indeed old fashioned balances, are capable of working in either. It seems very stupid to me that I am to be prevented using the weights and measures I'm used to and happy with.",
