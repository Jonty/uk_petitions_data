            "background": "With the average house prices at record levels the 'AVERAGE' first time buyer has enough difficulty getting a mortgage and then has the immediate added expense of energy bills, insurances and council tax. I propose a 1 year waiver of council tax period so first time buyers are not in danger of financial difficulty in the first year and allow them to save some money for 1 or 2 months mortgage payment as the mortgage lenders are more than happy to take steps to repossess your home at the first sign of trouble.",
