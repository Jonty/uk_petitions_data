            "background": "High Pitched sound devices should be classed as an offensive weapon and those who hold a device should have to follow strict guidance, monitoring and rules which is currently not in place.\n \n High Frequency Sound devices omit a very pitched sound which can be heard by those under the age of 25.\n Although others maybe also able to feel the affects of the device.\n  The sound can cause discomfort, torment and pain.\n These devices can be purchased without any question from the internet or shops.\n  People in the area may feel headaches and tiredness and may not be aware of the device.\n The device could be used maliciously and abusively in the wrong hands.\n\n I feel the device is discriminative to certain age groups and is an attack on young people who have no control over the damage it may have to them.\n \n The device is non specific and may affect many people.\n \n Currently some shops and other organisations use this device.\n The device maybe intrusive to others environments.",
