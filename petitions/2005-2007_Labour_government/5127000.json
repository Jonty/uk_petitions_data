        "action": "Scrap the proposal of allowing \"lorry Roadtrains\" with a new max weight limit of 60 tonnes",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "According to recent reports the government is currently looking at allowing new roadtrain type lorries onto the roads of Britain. These monsters will be allowed to weigh up to 60 tonnes, and be substantially longer than current lorries. This is being touted by those in the haulage industry as an environmental improvement, ie; less individual lorries. However although this size of lorry may work on the vast open roads of the USA and Australia, they do not belong on our narrow and already congested roads. These vehicles will pose a menace and threat to all vunerable road user groups and therefore I would urge the government to rethink its position on the suitability of theses vehicles in the U.K. and therefore prohibit their use on U.K. roads completely.",
