        "background": "The word 'United' implies that the football club represents ALL of Manchester, and that the people of Manchester collectively support that club. \n\nThis is patently not the case, since there is another Manchester team, Manchester City FC also operating within the same highest echelon of football. \n\nIt is misleading for Manchester United to market themselves on the global stage as a team that 'unites' the football fans of Manchester, and it is suggested that they change their name to another variety of football soubriquet, such as Manchester Rovers (they do, after all, wander around Europe and other continents on promotional tours).",
