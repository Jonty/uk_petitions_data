        "background": "To put pressure on governments to enforce changes that will move the world economy towards sustainable growth steering the world away from complete collapse and conflict predicted within a matter of a decade or two. To recognise a matter of a state of emergency, but also promoting responsibility, enforcing new direction domestically and promoting in the media hope and not fatalism. To reign in the desire for growth in energy needs, greed, unnecessary materialism and wantonness. Basically a turnaround,a new capitalism, a civilised and quiet revolution.",
