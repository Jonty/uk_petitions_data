            "background": "The UK officially started to go metric in 1965. It is now more than 40 years and yet we still have a mix of metric and old-fashioned imperial units being used. The government sometimes states that the UK cannot go fully metric because not everyone understands it. Therefore it makes sense for the government to ensure that everyone is educated in metric as soon as possible. Children at school, adults in education, adults in the workplace, even those who are retired. All should be given access to metric education. It should be voluntary, as some people understand metric already. But if metric education is offered to all freely, then when the UK goes fully metric and removes miles, inches, pounds, etc., then no one can complain that they do not understand.",
