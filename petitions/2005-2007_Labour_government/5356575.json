All adults are mature enough to make decisions for themselves regarding how they want to be entertained.  Removing the right of adults to choose which films and videogames they wish to experience is a gross affront to civil liberties and is an insult to the intelligence of every adult in this country.  Adults should be free to make their own informed decisions about what types of entertainment they view.\u201d",
