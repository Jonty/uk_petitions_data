            "background": "There has been radio stations aimed at the gay community for over 5 years. They serves the gay community primarily nationally (and internationally) and one station has even won the accolade of BT Digital Radio Station of the year. They are currently broadcasted through internet feeds, Sky TV and DAB radio in London and Sussex. Providing a free national service would help bring the gay community closer together, helping isolated people within the community to feel included and dispel myths about the lesbian, gay and trangender community held amongst the general population.",
