However, an equal threat is that we may lose the liberties we need to enjoy life on this rapidly warming world. Therefore, in the same way the Government sent out copies of 'An Inconvenient Truth' to schools to raise awareness amongst the next generation of global warming, they should send them all copies of the film 'Taking Liberties' to encourage them to reclaim the planet from the fanatics and authoritarians that would have them afraid and compliant.",
