            "background": "Nurses undertake 3 years university education and work at the forefront of public health, often in dire conditions and under threat from the public.They often hold life in their hands. New nurses receive around \u00a319K a year. Student nurses are not paid for nursing duties undertaken whilst training.\n\nA new policeman/woman undergoes 15 weeks initial training (which is paid) and upon completion can expect around \u00a323K. \n\nBoth jobs are equally important and public sector but little parity in pay is realised. Nurses are no longer hand maidens but independent practitioners and should receive enumeration reflective of this.\n\nI petition that qualified nurses be awarded at least the same entry salary as a newly trained policeman/woman, and that public health budgets be announced that realise this.",
