            "background": "We the undersigned wish for the government to set a reasonable maximum figure for child support from the non-resident parent based on the needs of the child and not the income of the non-resident parent.  This maximum figure should then be adjusted down for those on lower incomes and higher outgoings.  It is also urged that the non-resident parent is automatically given same rights with regard to the child/children as the resident parent.  Custody of a child should not automatically be granted based on the sex of the parent.",
