Typically a BMI of less than 18.5 is considered underweight or malnourished.\n\nUsing girls with such low BMI promotes an unhealthy body image, especially to vulnerable children.\n\nA recent survey from the British Paediatric Surveillance Unit estimates that 3.5 children in every 100,000 in the UK are treated for an eating disorder, including anorexia, bulimia and binge eating. \n\nBoth Milan and Madrid have already introduced bans to reduce undereweight models on catwalk show.",
