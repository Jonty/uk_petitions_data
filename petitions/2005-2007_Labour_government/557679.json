        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Sir Frank Markham School serves an area of Milton Keynes which is said to be challenging and deprived, but the school is doing well, especially for children facing difficulties with education.\nIn order to get a new building, the governors (reluctantly) and local authority want it to become an academy, handing it over to private control. Many parents and others in the local community do not want Sir Frank to leave the local community's democratic control and the local partnership of schools. There is a cheaper renovation option, but the only way it seems the local authority and school can get the money they need is to go for an academy.\nWe do not believe this is fair or a good use of public funds -- please sign!",
