It\u2019s as easy as that.\n\nVery similar to the various TV shows of late only this is Real money for Real people with Real reasons, that\u2019s the true 3 R\u2019s Tony should be concentrating on. \n\nThe money will be dished out to who ever the public votes for. Please tell every single person you know about this petition and who knows! \n\nHow can Tony B and his sidekicks refuse over a million residents of the UK?\n\nIf you want something that bad, please sign my petition and lets all have it!",
