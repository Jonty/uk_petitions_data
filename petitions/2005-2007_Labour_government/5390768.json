            "background": "Noise Nuisance from Car Exhausts\n\nThe primary legislation aimed at dealing with such noise is the Motor Vehicle (Construction and Use) Regulations 1986. These regulations lay down maximum permitted noise levels from exhausts and the regulations are enforced by the police and the Vehicle Inspectorate.\nCommon law nuisance and section 82 of the Environmental Protection Act 1990 also both allow individuals to take their own legal action.\n\nMr. Drew: To ask the Secretary of State for Transport what measures he has put in place to ensure that car owners do not alter exhaust or silencer systems after an MOT test to ensure that those systems do not break noise regulations. [114124]\n\nDr. Ladyman: Enforcement of the Road Traffic Regulations is primarily a matter for the police, although the Vehicle Operator and Standards Agency support this process through a programme of roadside inspections.\n\n* Excessive noise\n* Inappropriate in residential areas\n\nStupid exhausts are an injustice. Express your freedom of conscience and force the government to wake up and pass legislation!",
