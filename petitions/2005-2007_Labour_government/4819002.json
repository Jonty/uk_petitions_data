            "background": "Goods bought from sellers outside the EU and delivered by post are currently subject to VAT and import duties if the package value is over \u00a318. This allowance has not changed for several years, an effective reduction in real terms after inflation.\nOn top of this customers are charged a 'clearance fee' by the courier. Royal Mail, which handles the vast majority of inward post, doubled their fee to \u00a38 in April 2007.\nThere is no market competition for clearance and customers are effectively charged twice, having already paid delivery fees to the vendor. Customers have no way of knowing when purchasing what fees they will be charged.",
