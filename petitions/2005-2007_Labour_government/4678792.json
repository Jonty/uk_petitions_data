It is merely been used to gage public opinon on a couple of issues, which is already fuffilled by the media. Instead perhaps a system should be created which easily displays current major leglisture under consideration, and allows people to coment and vote on it, much like a referendum. Currently people are meant to influence the leglisture through their M.Ps, however most people, especially the young have little contact with their MP, who often covers a respectable constituancy. A internet forum would be far more popular and accesable. It would also provide an offical negative vote by the public to preposed goverment leglislation, such as road pricing, rather than the written objections that the petition system provides.",
