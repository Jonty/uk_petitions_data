That this will NOT prevent \"Global Warming\", but will provide ample opportunity for bogus callers to enter OUR homes whilst making threats about \"fines\". That without obeying this bureaucratic monster WE ALL will become OFFENDERS for daring to sell our own property without this de-facto \"licence\". That this is no more than a scam to extract more taxes and for the State to gain an interest/charge on OUR HOMES should we dare not comply. Keep the State OUT of our homes. Our homes will REMAIN our castles.",
