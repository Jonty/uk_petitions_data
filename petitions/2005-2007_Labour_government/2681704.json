            "background": "currently NHS Trusts do not fund student nurses. This means that students work on the wards (30 hours per week for thirty weeks a year) at no cost to the trust.\nObviousley with students working on the wards the easier it is to understaff them saving the trusts money.\nWhen the students graduate their are not enough jobs, and currently in some trusts their are NO jobs. The number of student nurses is increasing, along with the number of unemployed qualified nurses. Student nurses should not be seen as a source of free labour, they should be treated as an investment.\nIf the trusts paid for the training of student nurses they would be more inclined to match the number of students with staffing requirements. Having invested in a student for three years they are less likely to throw them into unemployment on graduating, giving them a chance to follow their chosen career.",
