            "background": "Ever wondered what is wrong with the country?\n\nOnce upon a time, women could not vote. Go back further and men couldn't vote unless they were wealthy. Go back further still, and nobody had a vote.\n\nAre we better off because of these moves towards democracy?\n\nIf so, why not complete the process by ensuring that children's interests are represented in elections.\n\nI don't have to spell out the difference such a reform would make to the way we are all governed, but if you are a parent, or are planning to become one then ask yourself this question.\n\nHave recent governments been busy making this country a better place for my children to grow up in?\n\nIf the answer is no, then give politicians a reason to listen to the concerns of parents and others who want a decent future for this country.\n\nThis petition can bring about the changes needed to make this country a safer and happier place; a true democracy.",
