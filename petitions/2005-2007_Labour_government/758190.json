        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "St. George's R.C. High School has had rising exam results over the past few years and is one of the top High Schools in Salford. It's friendly atmosphere of work and play has recently aided greatly in the latest GCSE results. As a school, it is trusted and is a large part of the local community. So much so, that the recent signs of closure from the local council has filled the local newsaper with stories of campaigns from all around, all to keep the school open. The councils adoption of a tried and failed method of improving schools \"for the future\" is somewhat ridculous as its plans state that it looks after every school under it's jurisdiction, whereas St. George's is to be simply shut down without renovation or re-build. Morally and socially, closing this school is wrong, so please sign the petition to keep its doors open for many prosperous years to come.",
