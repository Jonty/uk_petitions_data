            "background": "Mr Prime Minister,\nWe the undersigned want to see legislation introduced to prevent the minority of individuals acting in a deeply antisocial manner by driving around city streets and communities whist playing excessively loud and bass heavy \"boom blaster\" music, played through ridiculously powerful car audio units and speakers. This music can often be heard literally streets away and causes concern, disturbance and distress to many people in who are violated by it but who have no control over it.\nIn addition it is a phenomenon that seems to be on the increase. The \"thudding\" noise produced is nearly always offensive and intrusive and the behaviour is not only disrespectful and disregarding of the majority others, but also extremely antisocial.\nPlease legislate to stop the scourge of his mobile noise menace!",
