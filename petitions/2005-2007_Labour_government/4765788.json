        "background": "The world would be a much happier place if sex and nudity were not suppressed on TV and in public places because this is the most natural thing in life and would encourage art & friendship. Whereas the constant portrayal of gratuitous violence and warfare is totally unnatural and offensive and should be made illegal.
