            "background": "With so much media coverage about the environment, I think that now is the time to improve things closer to home. In many places in Britain, litter appears in trees, motorway edges, lay-bys etc. I think that people would like to help improve the environment, and perhaps the idea of \"tidying up\" by collecting litter, whenever possible, would go a long way to improving things. The government should promote a \"Clean-Up\" campaign and perhaps, we might eventually have the same attitude to litter as we have to \"Don't drink and drive\", ie it would become socially unacceptable. If everyone in Britain picked up one piece of litter, that would amount to a huge improvement.",
