            "background": "At the moment EU students can go to Scottish universities and pay no course fees (in line with Scotland's educational policy) so English taxpayers are not only having to pay course fees in English univerisities but also subsidise Scottish and EU students. \nAlso, the governments of EU students coming to English universities should be responsible for their course fees  and student loans and should pay them upfront. At present the British taxpayer funds their course fees and loans and then the majority go back home and never repay the money. This is totally unacceptable and unfair to English students and taxpayers. Although the government claim they chase these fees they are singularly unsuccessful and again the taxpayer has to fund the department who is doing the chasing.",
