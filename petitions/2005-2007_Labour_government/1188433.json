            "background": "Whilst there is no intention to discriminate against gay people, there are times when allowing one minority to do something will harm another. A child deserves the right to have both a male and female role model in a settled married relationship with  each other. There are laws preventing the discrimination on the grounds of age but we do not expect to allow OAPs to adopt. There are laws to prevent discrimination against the disabled but we would not expect a paraplegic to be able to adopt. The interests of the child come first and it is the duty of government to recognise that a heterosexual couple within the framework of marriage is the only legitamate adoption criteria.",
