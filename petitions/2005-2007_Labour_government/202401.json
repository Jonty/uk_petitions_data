        "background": "The government has been keen to stress that the entire country will benefit from the Olympics and that any profits will be redistributed nationally, so it only fair that the funding burden is fairly spread nationally rather than mainly on London council tax payers. Alternatively, London council tax payers should receive a massive refund from the profits to reflect their contribution.",
