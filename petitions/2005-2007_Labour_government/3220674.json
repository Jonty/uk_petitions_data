            "background": "Our government has funded part of the developement of aircraft in the past such as concorde. There for would it be a good idea to fund a plane that will fly above our o-zone layer and not threaten global warming on our planet rather than just raise the tax on overseas flights. By putting a plane into the stratosphere it would not use so much fuel and so reduce the use of our fossil and more importantly the finite fuels of our planet",
