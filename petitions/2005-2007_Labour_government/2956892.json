            "background": "It is most dangerous for a fast moving lorry or car to pass a much slower road user without first signalling to indicate their presence to following traffic.  Cyclists, walkers and horse-riders are particularly vulnerable to being side swiped by tail-gating vehicles whose inattentive drivers have only seen the slower person at the last moment.  It is beyond belief that on todays congested roads drivers will not indicate, slow down or pass slower traffic with a margin of safety.  In particular, it is reassuring for tired cyclists to see that the passing vehicle's driver has indicated their presence and thus cares about their safety.  Why are drivers so lazy?  One little press of a lever could literally save a life! It even matters when no vehicles are behind the passing vehicle; a vehicle coming the other way might be about to overtake, just as the slower traffic on the opposite side is being overtaken.  So, AT ALL TIMES, mirror, indicate, manouevre and PASS SAFELY.",
