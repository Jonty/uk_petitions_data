        "background": "Congestion charging doesn't work,no matter what lies our mayor tells us. It is just another tax. Greenwich Council has slowly succeded in driving busieness' and industry from the Greenwich Borough over the last 20 years.\nSo if you live in Greenwich, chances are you work outside of the borough because of the lack of industry within it.\nNow in collaboration with TFL, Greenwich Council want to introduce the congestion charge so that you pay to enter/exit the borough,but also pass through it via Blackwall tunnel.\nAll road users are very heavily taxed already and tolls are an added unjust burden that particularly hits drivers on low incomes.",
