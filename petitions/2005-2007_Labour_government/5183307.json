        "background": "The Obscene Publications Act 1959 is an out of date, virtually useless piece of legislation. Its definition of \"obscenity\" as something which \"depraves and corrupts\" is an uncertain, unclear and completely subjective test, dependent solely on alternate attitudes and opinions and feelings of particular judges and juries. Obscenity is a moral attitude which every individual perceives differently; some are offended easily and some are rarely offended at all. Individuals should be able to make up their own minds about what they deem to be obscene, and avoid such material if they do, and embrace it if they do not. A law against such material, except where it protects children, violates individual liberty.",
