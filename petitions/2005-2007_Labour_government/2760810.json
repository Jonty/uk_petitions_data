            "background": "At present, only British motorists are taken to court and fined for traffic offences caught on camera such as speeding. This is because the autorities do not have a record of foreign number plates on their systems. As such, foreign motorists cannot be caught or fined through the British legal system for commiting the same offences as British citizens. This in many people's minds is a serious and blatant form of discrimination. I urge the government to cease legal action against offenders until ALL foreign motorists in Britain are both traceable on the DVLA computer and treated equally.",
