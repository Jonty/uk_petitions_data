            "action": "make subject to approval by the British People by referendum any further amendment of or addition to the treaties which create and regulate the European Union, in particular amendments covering the areas of defence, foreign affairs, justice, law and order, the numbers of commissioners and their method of appointment and selection, the creation of new executive positions such as President of Europe and Foreign Minister of Europe, and the powers of the European Parliament.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Govermnment promised us a referendum on a European Constitution.  It now appears that the European leaders, including our Government wish to implement some or all of the defunct European Constitution, without further ado.  This is a betrayal and cannot be allowed to happen.  The most important freedoms we have are enshrined in our history and our unwritten constitution.  Already much of our freedom has been eroded by gifting authority to Europe. As I write this, Europe is about to remove our freedom of speech, overriding our own centuries-old laws defending freedom of speech.  The Government have allegedly confirmed they intend to support changes to the European Treaties permitting, among other measures, the election of a President of Europe, and abolishing our veto on law and order and justice.  They have confirmed this will be done WITHOUT a referendum, a complete betrayal of this Government's promise to the People.  Sign this petition, please. It could be the most important thing you do to protect your freedom, ever.  If the politicians want to change our nation's sovereign rights and freedoms, let them explain to US what they are doing, why they want to do it, and let US decide.",
