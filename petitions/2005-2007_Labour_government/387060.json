            "background": "Prime Minister, you have addressed the problem with Anti-social behaviour numerous times. My solution is to Ban football; young kids watch these pathetically overpaid knuckle draggers week in week out, F**king and Blinding and abusing the match officials and think, Hey if Wayne does it then I will aspire to him, and I will do it to my teachers and elders thinking that is how one can behave in society. Simple get rid of Football, in all fairness they\u2019re pretty crap at what they do, so no real loss and therefore we can put forward capital and resources to Gentleman\u2019s sports like Tennis, Cricket and Rugby (Union)",
