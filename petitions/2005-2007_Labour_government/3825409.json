            "background": "Please help to get motorway service stations to Reduce their prices. When your driving on a motorway journey and need to rest these are the only safe places to stop at. The food and Drinks are over priced and sometimes not that good. The highway agency always says when Driving and you start feeling tired take a rest.There is no need for them to charge so much. If they lowered the prices more people would stop and rest making the roads that little bit more safe.",
