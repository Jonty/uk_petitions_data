The prime minister has made it very clear that despite the fact that over a million people signed a petition against road tax and extended congestion charging, that he still feels he should be enforcing these schemes, and not trying to think of alternatives. So sign up for  this petition if you would like to take action against the proposed schemes and bring your voice to his front door instead of his email inbox.",
