            "background": "How can anyone justify the height in fares for public transport. I think its disgusting that the government campaign to get people to use public transport, then whack the prices up. Is a \u00a32 fare to travel for 2 miles on a single really justified. I can understand congestion charges. Keep traffic down, keep atmospheric damage down, but don't you think the government are going to far. Just using the public now as its personal purse. Why are they pricing people out of using the buses or trains. I (just like many others) just cant afford to commute to keep a job. PROPERTY, TAXES AND NOW TRANSPORT. what is there to live for in the UK anymore???????????",
