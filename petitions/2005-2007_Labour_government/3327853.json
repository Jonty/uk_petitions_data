            "background": "This petition is made for the well being of everybodys safety, when a peodophile is released from prison he/she is still endangering people. we have the right to know if a peodophile is living in our town/city etc so then we can try and avoid those areas for our or our childrens safety! Tony Blair says the reason why peodophiles are giving new identities is so they can start a new life for themselves and for there own safety, why should they be given a better life after what they did to people and they should not have human rights after violating the law in such a horrible manner! so please sign this petition it will help alot of people!!",
