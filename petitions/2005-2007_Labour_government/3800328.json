            "background": "The UK is one of the few places in the world where current\n     accounts are still free.  As the Office of Fair Trading starts\n     to crack down on excessive charges for current accounts and\n     credit cards there are indications that some banks may\n     introduce monthly charges for all. People who incur charges are\n     warned beforehand in terms and conditions and should accept the\n     fees. Free banking should remain for \"good\" bank customers. WE\n     HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT. We give the banks\n     our money every month and they make massive profits so how can\n     they now say that they think its fair that we all pay to get\n     access to our own money???",
