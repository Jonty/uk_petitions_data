            "background": "I implore Tony Blair to dedicate more resources to stop child pornography on the internet and all forms of child abuse.  \nAny internet site provider found to be used for this should be shut down. Dedicate more resources to police who have to catalogue photos of crimes involving child abuse etc. \nRe-hab doesn't work for paedophiles - life imprisonment is the only realistic sentence.  How many times have we heard of a child being raped and/or killed by a serial paedophile.  It is not acceptable.  \nI find it intolerable to live in a society where a 3 month old baby is raped (Alan Webster case a few months ago) and sit back and do nothing.  I refuse to be de-sensitised by the ever increasing cases of child abuse and allow these things to happen to the most vulnerable members of our society.\nThis is outrageous.  Let's do something more about it at last. Please.",
