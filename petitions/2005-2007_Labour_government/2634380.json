        "background": "Internet is subject to serious abuse/misuse as those who use internet banking or have specialist knowledge of internet/electronic system will be aware of.\nIt is to easy to sign up to such petitions without proper consideration of the issue and its implications and they are a very blunt instrument in democratic terms.\nCombining Internet and petitions at first sight may seem an excellent way of improving the democratic system but on closer consideration they lead to a form of 'rule by the mob'. In a way we have seen the seeds of 'rule by the mob' by Government and its use of 'focus groups' to determine policy.  This leads to continuous changes of policy rather than giving  policies time to work and gives the 'Spin Doctors' enormous political power.\nSo let us Ban Internet Petitions before short termism and mob rule take over.",
