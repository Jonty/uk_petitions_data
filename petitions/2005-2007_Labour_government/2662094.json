        "background": "We want the government to recognize that drivers are already taxed per mile, and per engine size, through massive fuel taxation in the UK. This is in addition to  existing road tax which also penalizes drivers with bigger engined cars. We therefore ask that the proposed new forms of taxation are scrapped, since they essentially already exist.",
