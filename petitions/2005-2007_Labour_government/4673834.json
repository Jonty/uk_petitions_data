            "background": "3G and HSDPA is one year old and since it's inception in 74 countries, upto 70% of bees have died. 3G and HSDPA masts have a range of 1.2 to 5km many of which are located in rural areas where bees are needed to pollinate crops. The theory is that 3G and HSDPA transmissions are constant and thus, interfere with bees navigation system, rendering bees to get lost and never find their way back to the hive. It is down to the government to prove that 3G and HSDPA is not the cause or to ban 3G and HSDPA in rural areas that have crops requiring pollination. Einstein once said that if bees were to disappear then man has only 4 years of life left because of the food shartage that would ensue. the Governemt has to make sure this never happens by investigating HSDPA and 3G as the cause or not.",
