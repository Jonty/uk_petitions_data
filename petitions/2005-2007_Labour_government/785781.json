You won't know who gets to see it, and you won't know what use it's being put to next.\n\nThe government's name for this is Transformational Government, sounds nice, until you realize what\u2019s being transformed isn\u2019t government, but its power over you.\n\nThe Citizen's Information Project is another nail in the coffin of freedom.",
