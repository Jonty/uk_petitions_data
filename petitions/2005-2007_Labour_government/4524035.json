            "background": "Clamping a car that has over stayed its welcome or not properly displayed a valid parking ticket/permit should not be allowed. The consequences of clamping has not been thought through properly. Penalise the offending individual with a fine, but do not cause them further distress and cost by clamping and subsequent impounding of the vehicle. Parking is so restricted today in London, that the goverment and local authorities have made it virtually impossible for persons not to be fined or even clamped. What if a life or death situation arises and the vehicle is clamped? What if an emergency has arisen? What if a Childs welfare or health is at stake? To be fined only the situation is dealable, to be clamped makes the situation intolerable.",
