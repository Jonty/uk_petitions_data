            "background": "I retired through ill health in Feb 2006. I appplied legitimately for incapacity benefit but had 50% of any amount over \u00a385.00 per week taken from me because I had income from a pension fund that I had paid for voluntarily. This is in effect penalising me for having made private personal pension provision.The government actually give me only \u00a38.00 per week IB despite me having paid National Insurance contributions well above this amount for 39 years. This is a disgrace.I thought I had paid National Insurance contributions to insure me against sickness later in life.Not so. Last year 300,200 people had their IB reduced because of this unfair rule.",
