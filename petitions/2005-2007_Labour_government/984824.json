            "background": "In the recent Local Government White Paper the requirement for Councils to bid to change the Local Authority structure to unitary status is causing serious damage to service delivery to the public.\n\nCounty Councils see this as an opportunity to disband Districts and Districts see the reverse. The result is that millions of pounds is being wasted to submit applications to Government by the end of January. \n\nThis madness has to stop and if Government is serious about looking at unitary status then this should be considered properley and put to the local population in a vote, not left to local politicians to decide.",
