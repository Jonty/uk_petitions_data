            "background": "Currently working week limits do not affect the offshore industries in UK waters, the majority of people working 84 hours a week upwards. To counter-balance this the offshore regulators (UKOOA) reccomend that people in the UK sector work in a rotational pattern - 2 weeks on, 2 weeks off. However,  this is not enforced and many service company staff find themselves working between 2-6 weeks on with only 1 week off. This is known to affect safety and health adversely but individual companies put much pressure on the offshore regulators to make sure that \"2 and 2\" rotation is not enforced since they would be forced to hire more staff and would decrease their profit margin. \nPlease help to make the UK sector the safest and most attractive offshore sector in the world.",
