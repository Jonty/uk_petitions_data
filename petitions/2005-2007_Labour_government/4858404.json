            "background": "We are all being asked to watch our diets these day - count the calories, work out the salt, watch out for hydrogenated and saturated fats.  The Government has recently launched the traffic light system to help us do just that.  But it falls down in the big area of life which is eating out. Some restaurants already provide nutritional information but many which easily could simply refuse, often saying \"people don't want to know when they are having a treat\" or \"we don't know because our food is freshly prepared\" (well any restaurant that is controlling its portion sizes that loosely is going out of business very quickly!)\n\nI'm not suggesting it should be forced at people if they don't want to know.  No need to print it on the menu, but information should be compulsory on websites or from a leaflet in the store if a customer requests it.\n\nIf even MacDonalds can do it, so can everyone else!",
