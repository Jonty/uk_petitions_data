            "background": "Tail docking is a procedure where the tail of new born puppies is removed either by cutting or banding with a rubber band. The new Animal Welfare Act seeks to ban tail docking but allows exemptions for working dogs. However, where a total ban has been in place in other countries they have stated that tail injuries were not a significant factor and not an animal welfare issue. We therefore urge the government to ban docking in all dogs. There is no evidence to support claims that tail docking does not cause pain in new born puppies, in fact the opposite is true both in research papers and anecdotal evidence.",
