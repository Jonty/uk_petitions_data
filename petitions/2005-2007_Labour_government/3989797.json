            "background": "The pharmaceutical industry is not listening. The medical profession is not listening. That research into the value of statins is funded by the statin producers is unacceptable. \n\nPharmaceutical companies must be prohibited from funding clinical research. They should be prevented from discovering 'facts' that underpin the value of their products and create sales to the organisers of health care provision, world-wide. \n\nWe nominate the World Health Organisation as the most appropriate body to conduct an impartial analyis into the harm that statins have wrought across the globe. \n\nPetitioners from across the globe are welcome to sign here, so as to illustrate the extent of the damage done by statins. In the event of a UK postcode being required to complete the petition signing, please use 'LU7 4SX'. Thank you. Jeff Cable for Statins Damage Real People (SDRP)",
