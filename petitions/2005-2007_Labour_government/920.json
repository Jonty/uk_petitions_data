        "background": "The formative years are most important - the way we are treated when we are young mostly dictates how we behave throughout our adult lives.  Children now believe that they can get away with anything without serious consequence, and this spills over to adult life and is the primary cause behind many of societies problems today.  Fear of punnishment is not only effective, but essential to the development of both individuals and society.  Children are often to young to understand the implications to others of doing wrong, and the only way to train them is in our opinion corporal punishment.  The fear of this has worked in the past, and will work again in bringing our youth into line, and may just rescue this country from the moral abyss!",
