            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The issue has been around for yrs now & UEFA have'nt done a thing to resolve it, there has never been a shortage of tickets for the more than willing touts - some could be bought on the day before the match via the net for thousands of pounds. Also why do so many tickets go to corporate hosp. & for dignitaries, the real fans have been paying their money right through from the qualifying rounds & then when it comes to the final they are forced to pay well above the face value or simply sit at home and watch TV. Even if they are lucky enough to get a ticket or make the trip in the hope that they can get 1 near the stadium they are abused by the local police and treated as hooligans, beaten & pepper sprayed simply because they want to watch a game of football. We have already seen this year many British supporters from different teams battered and abused in European countries by the authorities that are there to protect them, how long will you wait to take action before another Hillsborough or Heysel happens. Genuine fans need protection no matter what team they are from, this time it was Liverpool, next year it could be Man UTD, Chelsea /Arsenal who had some of their supporters abused during this competition.",
