        "background": "It is unreasonable to require electors to select a single candidate in an election. This leads to a barrier to many independent candidates, in that people who might otherwise vote for them will perceive their vote as being wasted. The single transferable vote allows electors to rank candidates in order of preference, along the lines of \"I would prefer candidate A, but if that's not going to happen then I prefer candidate B to candidate C\".",
