        "background": "After a number of recent encounters with supposed men who cannot take their liquor, I propose a radical new measure to limit the damage they inflict upon society. I suggest that at the age of 18, every boy and girl should be given a drinking licence, which they are required to show each and every time they wish to purchase alcohol. Even at Esso garages. Drunken offences such as fighting, breaking stuff or urinating on other people (for example) could then be punished by deducting points from the licences, and an empty licence would mean no booze for, say, a year. I'm willing to bet that there'd be less drink driving too if people thought they might lose their right to a pint as well as a car, and I urge you to consider this proposal.",
