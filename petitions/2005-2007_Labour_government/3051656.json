            "background": "Exploitation of tidal power in the Severn Estuary would help Britain meet its targets of cutting emissions of carbon dioxide. The electricity generated by the barrage would be equivalent to eight large power stations.\n\nNo other source of renewable energy has the scale, reliability, predictability or proven technology of tidal power from the Severn Estuary, nor make the same contribution to security and diversity of supply from a single project.  \n\nThe scheme could supply six percent of England and Wales' power needs\n\nThe barrier would also help reduce flooding in the Severn basin which could increase as a result of global warming.\n\nThe project could cost between 6 to 8.4 billion pounds, (3p for each tax payeer for one year).",
