It already looks dated. It is aesthetically appalling. It doesn't even really look like '2012'.\n\nWhat a shocking waste of money!\n\nPlease scrap this lurid logo now and open up a competition to everyone in Britain to design a new one. Then we can all have a vote on the favourite, which would, in turn, raise awareness and help to foster a sense that in some way the games belong to us. You could even charge a few pence to vote and raise some money for the games along the way. Have you not seen how popular programmes like X-Factor are? Gees! Why isn't anyone with a modicum of business sense and cultural awareness on the management committee?",
