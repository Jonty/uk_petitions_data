        "background": "Petition to abolish the wheelchair you get based upon your post code area. You should be able to get a wheelchair suited to your clinical needs and one to suite your lifestyle, not any chair just becasue you dont live in the right post code area to get more funding for a better wheelchair that you may require. Due to the post code lottery of the NHS wheelchair service I have had to rely on local charity to get me a proper fitting chair for evererday use and sports use as the health service in my area does not provide sports wheelchairs to active people like me, instead they are happy to hand out heavy steel ones which dont fit kids like me properly. The steel chairs also make use more dependant on people as you cannot tip them up curbs like sports ones becasue steel ones are far to heavy, limiting how far and how much we go out unattended.",
