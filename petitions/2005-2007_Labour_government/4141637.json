            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Manufacturing energy efficient light bulbs uses more electricity than incandescent one. They use banned substances ie mercury vapour so disposal will be a big problem. They are too expensive and their life is greatly reduced by turning them on and off so people will leave them on thus increasing energy useage. Billions of light fittings currently in use cannot use energy efficient bulbs so this will be a huge cost to households. This decision will make no noticable difference to the environment and may well be more damaging.",
