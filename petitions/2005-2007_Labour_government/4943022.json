            "background": "Loose stones are laid onto tar that has been sprayed onto the road surface. The stones are not compressed into the tar, they use our cars to compact the stones!!. This means our cars are sprayed with the loose stones causing multiple stone chips and eventually rust.\n\nAlso the road is never repaired before the road is resurfaced. You therefore still have pot holes. Because the stones aren't compacted the loose stones are all pushed towards the centre or edge of the road. This causes problems for motorcycles/cyclists/pushchairs and people walking down country lanes that do not have paths. \n\nThis is a cheap, lazy and possible dangerous way to resurface our roads, we pay enough in car taxes that should enable the government to do a 'proper job'!!",
