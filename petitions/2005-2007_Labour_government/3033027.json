The Home Office cannot manage its current programmes let alone a new National Identity one. The NHS IT project is over budget and overtime with many leading computer science experts doubting it can ever be made to work. \n\nEven if a majority of citizens felt that the aims and requirements of the project were acceptable we have no confidence that a National Identity Information technology project will meet its specifications. Our civil liberties will be compromised.",
