            "background": "In March 2002, the Republic of Ireland introduced a tax on plastic shopping bags, a 'plastax'. While Irelands move has reduced plastic bags by 90% and brought millions in revenue for the Irish government, I say take it one step further - a total ban on plastic shopping bags.\nThe impact has obvious environmental benefits, including reduced litter, less for land-fill and fewer obstructions in drainage and sewage systems.\nThanks for reading.",
