            "background": "While we appreciate that staff and customers at restaurants need to be protected from smoke, customers at nightclubs have had the right to smoke taken away.  Most of the people who go to nightclubs smoke and those that dont realise what it will do to this industry.  It will close down clubs and lose jobs which is against what the ban was designed for.  What this petition proposes is that a minimum of 1 room or area be provided for smokers. Otherwise, the rights of people who are smokers and not working at that nightclub and that use nightclubs as entertainment and enjoyment are being taken away.",
