        "background": "Banks and card providers charge penalties if you breach your contract by defaulting, making a late payment, going overdrawn, returning a bounced cheque, or if a direct debit or standing order fails.\n\nThe thing is, they're not allowed to do this.\nWhat they can do is get you to cover the administrative costs that arise from it, but how much can it cost for a computer to print off a patronising automated letter, or to not process a direct debit? Not \u00a325 to \u00a340, but that's what they charge.  As many of you will have heard, the Office of Fair Trading has decided that banks and credit card companies should charge no more than \u00a312 for such breaches of contract.  I want the UK government to Force the major banks in the United Kingdom to stop applying bank charges unlawfully",
