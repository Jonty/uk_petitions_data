        "background": "Current TV licencing is unfair as there are now so many channels with digital and sky and with the licencing fee, people are paying twice. TV has also been linked with an unhealthy lifestyle.\nPeople who watch tv more will have to pay more (i.e reality tv lovers, which is on too much). This could also have a positive affect on the unhealthy and the obese, as it will encourage them to partake in other activities.",
