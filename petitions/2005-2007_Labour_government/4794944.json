        "background": "China detains many innocent prisoners.The majority of the innocent have either been arrested for speaking their views on the Chinese occupation of Tibet, or making a peaceful protest. People in the Tibetan Autonomous Region of China also get arrested for simply having a photograph of their spiritual leader the Dalai Lama. These people are paraded through the streets on open top trucks and taken to prison where they are tortured. We urge the prime minister to call for the release of the innocent in China's prisons, in particular Drapchi prison. Or to at least stop the torture and breaches of human rights",
