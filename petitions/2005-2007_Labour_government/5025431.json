        "background": "The Prime Minister last week announced that he would step down from office on 27 June following the outcome of the 6 week long Labour Leadership election.\n\nIt is now confirmed that there will be no leadership election, and that there is only one candidate for the Labour Party leadership.\n\nAccordingly there is no reason why the Prime Minister should not now submit his resignation to Her Majesty with immediate effect, and allow his successor Mr Brown to succeed him in office straight away, thus avoiding 6 weeks of paralysis in the governance of the United Kingdom.",
