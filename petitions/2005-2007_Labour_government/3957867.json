Serious casualties from Iraq and Afghanistan etc will need and receive advanced levels of care across a wide range of medical disciplines that can only be found in a major trauma  miltary hospital. Our numbers of casualties would  sustain a separate military hospital with the modern specialist equipment and skills of medical staff needed to give them the treatment they deserve.\"",
