            "background": "The blame culture in the medical profession will have caused many discrepancies and patients have no guarantees, yet, how we will be able to amend them without going to law.  We need an open, transparent and accurate system but take away the blame culture so that the medical profession can practice honestly for the safety of all patients in the United Kingdom.  At present many patients have not seen their records and there is no redress against mistakes or deliberate errors other than writing to our records.  Data Protection advise going to the magistrates court to have errors deleted but this is unheard of and resorts to the law and the blame culture again.  This does not help either side to resolve sometimes very serious concerns and can cause serious patient safety issues.",
