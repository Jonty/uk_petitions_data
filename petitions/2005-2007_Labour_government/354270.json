At the same time, global commitments of the armed forces have increased. Treasury-inspired accounting is leaving the armed forces, and the nation, vulnerable. Spending on the armed forces should be increased to a level commensurate with Britain's international obligations and responsibilities as a permanent member of the UN Security Council; commensurate with a well-funded, well-provisioned, well-trained armed services; and commensurate with or better than the percentage GDP spent on defence by similar wealthy nations.",
