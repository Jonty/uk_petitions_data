After all if the youth centers have not got enough money for pool tables and what not , what is the price of a football ? \u00a35 or \u00a310 ! There are plenty of underused playing fields in this country and giving this country its national sport to children will also give them their much needed exercise and self discipline ! So why not scrap the failing youth centers and pay for a football and a part time coach ?",
