        "background": "The Netherlands is often quoted as a prime example for efficient recycling. More than 60% for recycling of waste is quoted. In the Netherlands an environmental tax is levied on white goods at the time of initial purchase. This tax is then used to dispose of these products at the end of their useful life in an environmentally friendly way and with the minimum of fuss or trouble for the owner. This clearly leads to a significantly lower incidence of \u201cfly tipping\u201d so prevalent in our countryside.\nThis method should be adopted in the UK and extended for example to a levy on every packet of gum sold equivalent to the cost of  cleaning up the mess which it causes when it is irresponsibly dropped in the streets and on the pavements. \nOther examples might extend to goods that have too much packaging and generate unacceptable waste. \nIn the longer term market forces would tend to fix the waste and the mess issues, resulting in an improved environment for us all.",
