            "background": "We should change all road signs in the UK to use metres and kilometres only, removing all references to miles and yards.\n\nThe government already uses kilometres for things like exclusion zones (such as the bird flu outbreaks), so why not give us metric roads?\n\nIt has been over 40 years since the UK started to go officialy metric, and it was planned in the 1970s to change roads to metric then. But still we are stuck with archaic miles as if we were still in the Roman Empire.\n\n\nChange to kilometres, metres and kilometres per hour. Ireland did so successfully 2 years ago, and the UK should do the same now.",
