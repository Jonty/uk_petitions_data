        "background": "This is a petition protesting against the sale of concert tickets on the internet auction website Ebay. \n\nThe reason why I am starting this petition is because the vast majority of concert tickets available on Ebay have been bought by someone whose only intention when purchasing the tickets is to make a profit on them. People have realised that if they can get tickets for a concert which is likely to sell out then they can make a large profit by selling them on Ebay. \n\nAs someone who goes to concerts regularly this is an issue I feel strongly about. If a concert sells out before I get a chance to get tickets although I would be disapointed it would be a small consolation to know that everyone who bought a ticket did so with the intention of going to the concert rather than selling their ticket for a profit. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this and thank you to anyone who supports me.\n\nJonathan Slater (slaterjonathan@hotmail.com)",
