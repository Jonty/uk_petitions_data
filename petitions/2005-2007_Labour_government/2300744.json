            "background": "Stop all the ridiculous pay rises given to people who already earn more than the national average. If earnings are less than the national average then increases should be at least double that of the rate of inflation. But if your earnings are above the national average then pay increases should be no more than the rate of inflation. This will then gradually narrow the gap of the rich getting richer and poor getting poorer. Also it should be compulsory for every company to make annual pay increases.",
