Another reason, some vehicles may only see a few months on the road, classic cars for example, having to buy six or twelve months at a time, and then if the vehicle is only used for 2 months say, you must return to a post office to have the rest refunded seems a waist of peoples time, a simple account system would be easy, this should all be available through the internet.",
