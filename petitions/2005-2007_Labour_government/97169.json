            "background": "As the number of vehicles on the road continues to increase but the number of viable parking places remains static, there are an increasing number of drivers who use the pavement to park their vehicles.  This is hazardous for all pedestrians and makes a nonsense of \"Walk to School\" schemes.  Further the increased number of vehicles on the pavements is causing damage to the surfaces making it difficult for wheelchair and white cane users.",
