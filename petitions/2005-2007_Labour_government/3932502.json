Decisions based upon specious demographic data, were apparently already set in concrete prior to any consultions.\nThe locations of the proposed (actual predetermined) centres at Carlisle, Workington and Ulverston will be extremely difficult, if not impossible, for Eden Valley residents to use and return home by public transport within a 24 hour period.",
