            "background": "It is a fitting time, when remembering the act of parliament that abolished \nthe transatlantic transportation of Black slaves, to raise the need for a \nsymbolic apology from the British government for the enforced slavery of Black people.\n\nThe experiences of many Caribbeans and Africans today are testimony to the \nfact that the legacy of slavery still lives on affecting self-confidence, \nattainment and assimilation into society.\n\nIt is time that the British government accepted the travesty of slavery\nduring the 17th to 20th centuries and its devastating impact of the lives of \nthose who were forcibly enslaved and their descendants.\n\nPlease sign this petition if you believe that Black people will not be able \nto collectively progress unless an apology is made.",
