            "background": "Extreme amounts of money have been spent on foreign (mostly American) and/or unproven IT contractors to create IT systems for our goverment and our national services. This money has been wasted as the systems in place are nothing short of ridiculously ineffective and cost our services even more money in wasted time. In some cases, great harm is brought to our citizens and lives are ruined (e.g. The Child Support Agency).\n\nExamples of such unequivocal failures:\n\nThe NHS.\nThe Job Centre (JobCentrePlus).\nThe Child Support Agency.\n\nWe, the undersigned, demand that the government restrict government IT contractors to U.K. based companies and that those companies must have a strictly investigated record of high performance and high quality IT system construction.",
