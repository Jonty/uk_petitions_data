            "background": "We need to stop the people who are driving with no insurance or license, the way how to do this is to make a card that has a chip on it, so as you go to a petrol station before you put  your petrol into your vehicle, you go to the cashier give them the card, they swipe your card and then you can pay, now if the car is not insured, or your not the person who is on the card you get a fine of \u00a310.000. This will stop people from driving with out a license and with out insurance because they will not be able to get the petrol or diesel or what ever to get their vehicle moving therefore keeping them off the road, also if people are caught taking petrol out of other peoples vehicle they will also get a \u00a310.000 fine.",
