        "background": "The present British penal system is starting to fail under the cost and weight of too many offenders. Our social system is also stretched as a result of failings in immigration control and the efficient tracking of offenders appears to be beyond our current capability. Naturally we should expect that visitors to this country abide by our laws as we are expected to do in their country. Failure to do so should be treated correctly through the courts but there is a continuing considerable burden of housing foreign prisoners and then 'losing' them in our failed system. Automatic deportation from the Court or jail via a controlled  point of departure would save considerable sums and simply ensure that these people are no longer welcome and 'contained' in our society.",
