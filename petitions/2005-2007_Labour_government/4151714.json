We as disabled people with physical or Mental or learning problems are asked quite often for upto date letters from our GP's. The charges can range from \u00a315 to \u00a340 depending on the surgery that you attend. As a person on benifits cannot afford the charges. These charges should be included in their contracts so charges for letters do not happen again.",
