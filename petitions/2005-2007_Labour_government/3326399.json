            "background": "Petitions are a pointless waste of time and effort. Their existence simply allows people yet another opportunity to talk about things instead of doing something about them. No petition has ever successfully altered the outcome of any statutory, legal, or government policies. It may come as a surprise to some, but there is a democratic process called an election. During said elections you can vote to change the Government or council if you do not like or agree with their policies.\n\nThe sole achievement of any online petition is to clog up email inboxes with yet more pointless drivel.\n\nTherefore I propose that they should be made illegal, and yes, I am aware of the irony here.",
