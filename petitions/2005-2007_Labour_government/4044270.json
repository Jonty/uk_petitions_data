            "background": "Green taxes have gained increased popularity due to environmental awareness and it often encourages the public to choose green goods and services as untaxed alternatives. Light bulbs and shopping bags are two common goods for which there are environmentally friendly alternatives. However, I believe it is inequitable to charge green taxes on goods and services where no other alternative exists, such as air-travel, which is compulsory for many businesses.\n     When suitable alternatives exist, green taxes are good for encouraging people to live in an environmentally friendly way. However, I believe it is wrong to force taxes upon people who have no choice but to act in specific ways, such as drive cars to work because of unreliable public transport, and those who have to fly on business.",
