            "background": "ITV interrupts live coverage of Formula One motor racing with advertising breaks that ruin the race for viewers. It could, if it chose, show the ads in the parts of the programme that occur before and after the race itself, but it doesn't because it puts its profits before viewers' enjoyment. Ofcom regulations on the placing of ad breaks forbid ads in coverage of continuous live events with few exceptions, none of which apply to Formula One. ITV receives the coverage without any breaks in it, and chooses to put the ad breaks in when it could so easily put them into the rest of the programme instead.",
