        "background": "The PM should stop penalising those of us who own cars, and he should stop using the environment as an excuse.  Road users already pay tax on using the road, on petrol, on insurance, etc etc.  If you have an inefficient car then you pay more tax by buying more petrol.  The tax paid by road users is not plowed back into improving the roads, nor is it put into public transport. Road users are massively overcharged and it seems this isused to fund pet projects, and non jobs.  This must stop.  Congestion charging, road charging/tolls, higher taxes, more expensive residents permits.  All of this is an unfair assault on road users.  Public transport is an expensive shambles, so with no alternative to using the roads the Govt should re-assess their priorities.",
