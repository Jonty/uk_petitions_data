            "background": "People who have a history of benefit fraud should not be allowed to use public services such as the CSA and legal aid, at a further cost to the tax payer (especially if they're not on income support anymore and now working or have a new partner who can support them).\n\nAt present, such people can use public funds to prevent the non resident parent having access to their child through the courts. The CSA is also, under current legislation, expected to assist such people,(at a further cost to the taxpayer), to hound the non-resident parent for maintenance.\n\nIf the person committing fraud was committed to prison for their crime (as they would be if the prisons weren't so full) the child would be placed with the non-resident parent. The criminal parent would then know what it would be like to be pursued for child maintenace!\n\nWE NEED TO SHOW BENEFIT CHEATS THAT CRIME DOESN'T PAY.",
