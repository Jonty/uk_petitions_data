        "background": "We represent residents of Standon & Puckeridge in Hertfordshire.  The A120 passes through both villages with the load and speed of traffic at increasingly dangerous levels. We have formed a committee called Standon A120 to press Herts County Council to commit to a future bypass.  In the meantime there needs to be a real enforcement of speed limits and some means of providing breaks in the traffic flow to enable safe turning onto the main road through the villages.  Recent safety measures have had limited effect and we would ask for your help by supporting our petition.  Thank-you",
