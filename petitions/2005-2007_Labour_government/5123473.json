            "background": "We ask the primeminister to scrap the planned ID card scheme, on the grounds that the planned national identity register and data sharing between government departments of people's personal and private information, is massively invasive into people's privacy. We also believe that the compulsary finger printing and gathering of other biometric information from every person in the UK is not only intrusive, it would also be the action of a forceful and controlling dictatorship, rather than a democratic and fair goverment.\nWe have no problem with some form of ID in order to verify a person's identity, for example, like in the USA, a photo card driving license and a non driver's ID card NOT connected to a central state identity database and NOT requiring biometric data to be taken.",
