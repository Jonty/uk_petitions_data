Therefore I would like to suggest an easy to manage solution . It being . No dog regardless of size or breed  be allowed out amongst the public without a muzzle , also no dog would be allowed off of a lead within 50 meteres of street lighting or within 50 meteres of any building that is to be used by the public . I believe these easy to understand measures would make the law easy to enforce and also create a better environment for both the dogs and the public",
