Banning planes to certain countries.\nThe following countries should be banned having air flights to them and from them: France, Belgium, Germany, Holland, The Netherlands and Ireland . All internal flights should also be banned. This is to stop pollution by planes. \nb. A new rail tunnel should be constructed to Germany. This will allow for quicker travel without planes to the continent.\nc. Rail lines within the UK should be doubled in most places if internal flights are banned. \n\n- I hope you see the light in this major petition to change the transport network.",
