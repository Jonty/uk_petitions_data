You can claim via compensation boards, employment tribunals, malpractice courts, indemnity insurance and a bunch of other specific routes, but these are exceptions and do not confer a general right. There are too many cases where the government acknowledges fault and does not provide compensation because they are not obliged to do so. That obligation is surely an essential part of the social contract with each citizen.",
