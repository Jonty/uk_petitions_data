            "background": "There has been a recent press report of a number of dangerous killers being moved to open prisons against the wishes of prison govenors and probation officers. This policy urgently needs review. If we need more prison space we ought to build more capacity, or release petty, non-violent offenders (such as TV license evaders or cannabis users). We should not put high-risk criminals into open prisons, which is tantamount to releasing them early!",
