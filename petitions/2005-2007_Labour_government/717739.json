        "background": "I am a learner driver and my opinion is that the motorway is a very busy carriageway and can be very dangerous when one driver makes a mistake causing accidents and pile ups.\n\nDrivers who use the motorway for the first time can be nervous with no confidence which can cause them to make a mistake causing a accident.\n\nI would like to see it law that all new drivers should take a lesson and test on the motorway to build up their confidence as this may cause less accidents.",
