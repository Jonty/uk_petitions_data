            "background": "\"Tailgating\" (persistently driving a vehicle too close to the rear of another at speed) is a deliberate threat to the lives of the driver and passengers of the  vehicle in front, and leads to many, if not most serious accidents on our roads. The offence is a considered one and no different to a threat using any hazardous but otherwise legitimate tool such as a knife or a shotgun. \"Tailgating\" should be recognised as a Criminal offence, rather than a mere traffic violation and offenders dealt with accordingly.\n\nPolice should be encouraged to target \"tailgating\" using appropriate technology such as cameras - it appears to be almost ignored at present.\n\nMany lives could be saved and serious injury prevented by a reduction in this deliberately dangerous practice.",
