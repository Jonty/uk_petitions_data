            "background": "Motoring offences are uniquely subject to absolute penalty, for all practical purposes without appeal.  Motorists fined for small infringements after years of care and adherence to the law feel justifiably aggrieved and this feeling is exacerbated by frequently lenient sentences given to real criminals.  The system holds enough information about us to automatically assign credit to each licence holder for every \"innocent\" year.  To illustrate: say, 1/5 credit per annum for a speeding offence less than 20% above the posted figure.",
