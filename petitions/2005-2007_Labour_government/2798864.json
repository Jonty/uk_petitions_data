            "action": "ensure that Ofcom refuses to allow Sky to close down its 3 popular Free to Air Freeview Channels Sky Three, Sky News and Sky Sports News, so that they can then be replaced with a range of  expensive pay Sky tv channels",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Sky's decision to withdraw its 3 free to air channels from Freeview appears to be part of a quite deliberate strategy to devalue the choice of channels on offer on Freeview so it ultimately only provides an extended multi channel tv range from just the BBC, ITV, Channel 4 and Five, thereby ensuring UK homes who want to watch other channels feel pressurised to sign up to pay tv services such as Sky Digital. The widening of Free to Air television choice on Freeview has been enormously popular with the public and for Ofcom to allow valuable and extremely limited bandwidth currently used by Freeview channels to be converted for pay tv would be a clear cut dereliction by Ofcom of its principal duty to protect UK citizen consumers. Allowing Sky to offer a pay tv service on digital terrestrial is also likely to constitute an anti competitive threat to the fledgling efforts of its smaller pay sports tv rival Setanta to offer a single pay per view sports tv channel on digital terrestrial.",
