            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "At present local authorities use class A1 of the 'Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987' to zone off areas for development for retail use. This includes 'shops, retail warehouses, hairdressers, undertakers, post offices, dry cleaners, Internet Cafes etc.'.  We believe supermarkets, hypermarkets, retail warehouses, shopping malls and retail parks should be pulled out of A1 classification and reclassified to class A0. This is because they are dynamically different from high street shops such as hairdressers, post offices etc..  They generally command a larger footprint (portion of land); they operate longer opening hours; they have greater implications on the local traffic, local economy and the local environment; and, the buildings are usually fabricated and temporary (sheet steel frameworks). Class A0 should be available for local authority planners to be distinct from smaller individual shops and shop/residential buildings, making local plans more effective to their area.",
