        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The UK is almost unique in Europe in not having a paramilitary \"third force\" to bridge the gap between the Armed Forces and Civilian Police.\n \nThe police have to carry out so many Specialist Operations it is having a negative effect on their ability to combat \"normal\" crime; there are only so many Coppers to go around. For example, last year the Met spent more on protecting VIPs than it did dealing with crimes against \"real\" people, including rape and murder.\n\nMr Blair, let this be your Legacy: set up a nationwide, para-military agency to carry out Specialist Ops, i.e. protecting VIPs. And free up the police to protect the rest of us.",
