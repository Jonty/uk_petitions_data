            "background": "Phase out the television licence fee over a five year period (enabling the BBC to adjust to operating in a purely commercial environment) and introduce a 'fifth estate' fee - a statutory payment of c\u00a3500m per annum to fund a News and Current Affairs operation independent of government or commercial pressures. The objective is to abolish an unjust tax for an entertainment service but retain an independent medium to report on news and current affairs, challenge government policy, uncover wrongdoing, promote nationhood.",
