        "action": "Illegalise the act of driving a HGV or speed limited vehicle in Motorway overtaking lanes 2 and 3",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Every trip taken on any of the motorways in this country will have one consistent thing in common.  HGV's trying to overtake other HGV's with an almost un noticeable speed difference.\n\nThis act causes a 3 lane motorway to reduce to a one lane for vehicles travelling faster than the HGV's and so creating a 'moving bottle neck'.  In some circumstances, The petitioner has witnessed HGV's trying to overtake in both lanes 2 and 3 at the same time so effectively reducing the motorway speed limit to 60mph.  \n\nThis petition is to make illegal the act of driving any speed limited vehicle or HGV in either lanes 2 or 3 on any of the motorways in the country, so freeing up the lanes for free flowing traffic and reducing motorway congestion.",
