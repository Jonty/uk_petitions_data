            "background": "I've just read a feature in my paper about adoption versus fertility treatment; the advocate of adoption made a lot of points with which I agreed but also said prospective adopters are put off by all the scrutiny to which they are subjected.  In my opinion ALL prospective parents should be subjected to some sort of scrutiny to see if they would give their potential children the love, emotional security, confidence, and self-esteem all children need; I only regret that this is not possible for those conceiving naturally and with little or no difficulty.  Since, however, it WOULD be possible to do this with all other prospective parents this is something I would definitely advocate; and if people seeking fertility treatment were subjected to this that would give adoption and fertility treatment a level playing field.",
