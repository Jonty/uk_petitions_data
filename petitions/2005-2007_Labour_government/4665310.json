            "background": "Throughtout the country, thousands of small businesses operate through limited companies.  The Chancellor encouraged this in 2002 with the introduction of the \u00a310,000 \"nil\" rate band.  However, this has been removed and he is now increased corporation tax; to 20% from 1.4.07, 21% from 1.4.08 and 22% from 1.4.09.  This is grossly unfair for a sector which provides many thousands of jobs and output for the economy.  These organisations have to struggle with red tape and quite often take a risk by being entrepreneurial, and therefore an increase in corporation tax is (a) a slap in the face and (b) a message to anyone wanting to work for themselves - don't expect any favours.\n\nWe believe the previous rate of corporation tax, 19%, to be fair and ask that it is reinstated as such.",
