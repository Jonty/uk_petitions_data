            "background": "Higher rate mobility DLA gets you access to all sorts of mobility assistance. Those of us on Lower rate mobility DLA especially in families with 2 or more children on the benefit can be just as dependent on cars as those on Higher rate mobility DLA but are more likely to be forgotten when it comes to offering assistance to the disabled with mobility costs leaving us with just a small amount per week to help us from the lower DLA payment. Ability to use public transport is not assessed. If we are not to be housebound we will need assistance with Road Pricing too not just Blue Badge holders or Higher Rate Mobility DLA recipients",
