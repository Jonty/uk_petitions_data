By splitting the Home Office into two it is merely knocking a wall down rather than dealing with the long-term subsistence.\n\nIt will not deal with the issues of mass immigration, knife/gun crime policing or  any of the othe numerous pressing issues affecting our security in the broad and narrow sense.\n\nFinally where is the debate on this momentous move?\n\nThere is none and that is above all why I am starting this petition.",
