            "background": "The Chancellor's doubling of air passenger duty has put a massive strain on the charity Chernobyl Children Lifeline. We bring more than 4,000 children a year to the UK from Belarus to give them respite and care to help them combat a variety of illnesses, including all types of cancer, resulting from the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear disaster. Because Belarus is not in the EU flights from there are classified as long haul and as a consequence we have to find \u00a340 duty for every child before we raise the money for the air fares. This means a total of \u00a3190,000 a year spent on duty alone. It is an unsustainable situation for any charity and certainly for one the size of ours.",
