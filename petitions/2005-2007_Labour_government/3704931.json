        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Reduce the speed limit for all UK road traffic (including motorway traffic) to 55 mph and enforce it thoroughly in order to increase safety and conserve fuel.\n\nA majority of car manufacturers confirm that their vehicles operate most efficiently at around 55mph.  \n\nBenefits include:  Fewer pile-ups.  Less fuel burned.  Greater opportunity to avoid obstacles.  More robust treatment of reckless, wasteful and impatient high speed motorists.  Less accidents and accidents of lower severity will put less pressure on emergency services.  A reduced speed limit may cause some motorists to consider other transport options.  The reduced carbon emissions will contribute to the UK\u2019s climate change targets.\n\nPossible issues:  Motorists like going fast so this will be unpopular.  Journeys might take longer and involve more safety breaks.",
