Their idea is to kow tow to the EU, the PC brigade et al and on the back of some sad sound bite and bring everything down to the lowest common demoninator. Ed Balls advocating the selling off of the UK, the neutering of the armed forces, immigration out of control, stealth taxes to fund the dream of a leftist eutopian nanny state and to fund the self promotion of ineffectual prats who can't make a proper living in the Private Sector. When will it stop. \n\nIt is now that one understands those who take to arms as a last resort as the only way of actually getting through the system and to meglomaniac bureaucrats hellbent on promoting the destruction of all built by our forefathers. The taking to arms and revolution seem the only options left to get through the feelings caused by the systematic rape Middle Britain.\n\nCome on Blair, shape up or ship out and do whats right.",
