        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Global warming is a serious threat, and claims that it is simply a natural phenomenon are irresponsible and factually inaccurate, with naysayer's showing a blatant disregard for genuine scientific research and fact.\n\nI feel that a hard-hitting media campaign, in the form of television info spots and billboards, in a similar fashion to those already circulating regarding anti-smoking and drink driving would be an effective means of reducing the human impact upon global warming.\n\nI envision a simple concept demonstrating, with researched scientific fact, exactly how an individuals actions impact upon their environment. For example (and this is entirely conjecture): Leaving your TV on standby for four weeks melts one cubic meter of ice in the Arctic / kills one Polar Bear, alongside an equally hard-hitting photograph or image.\n\nI feel if people were to understand the immediate and personal effects of simply turning off the television at night, or changing to energy saving light bulbs, they may be more encouraged to commit to a path which may one day save our planet.",
