            "background": "The proposal for the London 2012 Olympic logo and brand has attracted widespread condemnation and prompted a huge number of  suggested alternatives. The logo and brand that is finally chosen will represent London, the entire UK and the Olympic games. We must be able to present this logo to the world with pride. It must be seen to convey the qualities that make London a great city to host the games. In our opinion, the current logo does not do this and a more suitable alternative must be chosen by popular vote of the people it will represent.",
