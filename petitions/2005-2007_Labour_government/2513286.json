        "background": "there are may reasons why muslims should be banned from wearing the veil in schools and public places a few of which being:its divisive between white and ethnic people. Its intimidating if there is a large group of them. There a security issue at airports as they are allowed to be let throught without a check because it might offend them. IF THERE A SLIGHT CHANCE THAT THEY COULD BE A BOMBER AND ITS A NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT THEN RELIGON SHOULD COME SECOND.Also could there be some women being made to wear the veil by their husbands?I think alot of people also find it offensive as it doesn't fit in with modern day britain.",
