There may be lines of text similar to \"You will surely own your home and you may get a bonus\" (Surely own your home?). Yet somewhere hidden in the 'small print' there is a get-out clause which takes all the responsibility off the organisation for featuring the imagery and missleading text. (\"investments may go down..\")It is obvious the intent was to 'sell' the product regardless of the longer term consequences. The organisation should be forced to uphold the \"surely own your home\" statement or similar statements regardless of the small print. Cases like this can be rejected by the ombudsman.",
