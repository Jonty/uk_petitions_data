Anybody living here must be contributing how else did this country become so great.  Those who love it stand up and be counted do not let British culture be swamped by the cultures of those coming here to settle.  They can bring their own cultures with them but never let them assume that in this country their culture is of more importance or value than that of Britain.  If you want to live here in peace and security respect the country that has welcomed you, supported and educated you.  British people stand up and be counted.",
