            "background": "The New Keyworker Housing scheme benefits many vital public sector occupations by giving them access to more affordable housing which they would not otherwise be entitled to.\n\nIn the school environment it is only teachers with Qualified Teacher status which are entitled to this support.  Occupations such as unqualified or trainee teachers, Teaching assistants, Cover Supervisors, and Learning support assistants are not included despite the vital work they do to support the teachers workload and assist in the Child's learning process, whether they are working with mainstream education, behavioural difficulties or Special needs children.\n\nThe petition is designed merely to change the classifications to allow such  occupations the right to be classed as keyworkers, in recognition of the work they do in schools.",
