            "background": "To give native wildlife a chance in the 21st century and far beyond, we must reafforest large parts of the country with native flora and trees. Agriculturalists could be offered insentives to afforest parts of their land, and wealthy landowners with large estates could be asked to afforest swathes of their land. This would help the battle against climate change, protect our wildlife, restore the natural state of the nation, and give everyone space to breathe and enjoy the woodlands of the UK. More forest parks could be set up, and hopefully the idea could be spread abroad, making the world green again.",
