            "background": "Ken livingstone has too much power and regardless of what Londoners say in these supposed consultations he does what he wants anyway.Both Labour and Ken livingstone are simply not listening to what We the British public want. If the proposed Low emmission zone and the proposed Congestion zone in Greenwich goes ahead most small businesses will be out of business as they will simply not be able to afford to get to work after having to pay congestion fares and Low emmission Zone charges.Countries like Germany already have in place fuel additives at the pumps available at a little extra cost which can easily be added to our fuel and so save on emmissions in the UK.Why then should we be forced to pay charges when it could be cheaper to invest in a more environmentally friendly bio-fuel. The government and Ken Livingstone stand to make more money by introducing the L.E.Z and further congestion zones.",
