            "background": "It sickens me that when a British Citizen will attempt to voice their opinion on the state of our un-sustainable immigration levels in England, they are silenced by the few, and their own government who will claim racism or just ignore them completeley. The government are only interested in making money and the economy, why else would they want such high levels of immigration? It is not as though they live in the real world, because if they did they would see the results at sreet level and halt it. This is a shot win option for the government, money now - deal with the crisis later.\nWhy are they ignoring the fact that England (not Wales or Scotland) has lost its National identity, because this is creating so many problems for society. We are no longer a nation of neighbours we are a nation of strangers!\nStop Immigration - at least until we can get it under control.",
