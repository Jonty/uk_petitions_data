            "background": "Up until 1956 the area of the North Sea that follows the coast of Europe from Esbjerg in Denmark to the Dutch island of Texel, with the historic island of Heligoland at it's heart was called the \"Heligoland Bight\" in the shipping forecast as broadcast on Radio 4. In 1955 German meteorologists managed to persuade other delegates at a conference that it should be renamed \"German Bight\", Heligolanders were as usual never consulted. The name should be reinstated as a mark of respect for the people who live there as it was British from 1807 to 1890.",
