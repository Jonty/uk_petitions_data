        "background": "These laws are a nightmare for parents and grand-parents particularly with more than one child to cope with and could even be counter-productive.  How many toddlers will be hurt running into the road whilst a howling, wriggling baby is being strapped in  and bored older children are very distracting to the driver.\n\nAnyone with a back problem finds the operation impossible.\n\nMore than 2 children creates disproportionate extra space, cost and hassle problems and could exaccerbate the demographic time bomb.\n\nThe rigidity of 'law' takes a lot of the spontaneity out of life",
