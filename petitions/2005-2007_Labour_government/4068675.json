How many toddlers will be hurt running into the road whilst a howling, wriggling baby is being strapped in  and bored older children are very distracting to the driver.\n\nAnyone with a back problem finds the operation impossible.\n\nMore than 2 children creates disproportionate extra space, cost and hassle problems and could exaccerbate the demographic time bomb.\n\nThe rigidity of 'law' takes a lot of the spontaneity out of life",
