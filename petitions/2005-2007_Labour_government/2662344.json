            "background": "I want fair assessments based on the actual cost an individual as to pay to enable them to live in their own home.   \nThis government should care for its people who are trying to make ends meet such as the disabled and the elderly and enable them to have a quality of life and a decent pension.  \nWe are being neglected. \nWe should be protected like the childrens act protects children.\nI was always proud to be British - well for gods sake respect your people - especially the people who were the backbone of Britain they do not deserve to suffer just because we need care and a basic standard of living without the worry of debt and dispair.  Stop this poverty gap and make sure pensioners and the infirm have enough to live on and not be discriminated against.  \nI would especially like to know where WE stand in the average basic wage category - well below the poverty line I am sure. \nI want a government that cares for it's people not just themselves and their lip service.",
