            "background": "While looking through petitions on immigration, for the purpose of creating this one, I saw A LOT of VERY anti-immigration petitions most expressing views that imply that the creators of these petitions perceive that immigrants are - heaven forfend! being treated better than indigenous British citizens; this perception probably derived from right-wing tabloids.  Some complain that immigrants are getting benefits without having paid into the system; the perception is that \"we\" are getting less than \"they\" are but this overlooks the free education and health treatment to which those of us who were born here have been entitled all our lives.  I would also reiterate the point that no one has any control over where they were born and should therefore neither benefit, nor be penalised, for this.",
