            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The current system makes the payment of EMA unfair as there are a number of young persons attending further education and not receiving the payment because their parents are earning just beyond the allowed amounts, this means their son/daughter misses out not only on the weekly payments but also the bonus payments, therefore the only encouragement for some young people to achieve is their own desire, as they are not encouraged by financial incentives. If this payment was made to all young persons then the government would reap the benefits later when the young persons enter into work and are able to get better paid jobs due to their educated status, therefore paying more income tax.",
