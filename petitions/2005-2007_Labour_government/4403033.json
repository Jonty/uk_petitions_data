        "background": "batteries such as AA and AAA sizes are sold with all sorts of claims as to their performance. But there is no quantitative information to enable a consumer to decide between the claims of rival manufacturers for their products. A compulsory test should be devised for batteries in typical use - as is done to develop mpg figures for cars - so that true capacity and value comparisons can be made",
