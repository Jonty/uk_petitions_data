A good example of this was Havant council banning the use of the words christmas, father christmas etc. because these words may offend an immigrant who did not believe in Christmas.I find this extreamly offensive to my beliefs.\nBy all means let people come to our country but don't tell me to honour their beliefs at the cost of my own.\nNo one forces these people to come here, it's their choice.",
