        "background": "Most of today's problems with street crime are caused by an overwhelming number of young people on the streets because their parents either don't care where they are or actively kick them out of home everyday. If these parents knew where their children where and kept the problem ones at home then society might be in a better state than it is now. I propose that parents who do not know where their children are should be fined as an incentive to keep them under control and the money can go back into society to clean up any damages they may have caused and pay for the government and police services that have to chase up after them.",
