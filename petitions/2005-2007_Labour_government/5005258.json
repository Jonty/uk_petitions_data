            "background": "For many years now it has become increasingly more noticeable that drivers taking a drink at the wheel, ie can of pop or bottle of water are being fined for doing so.\n\nMaybe it is correct, but surely it is just as dangerous or worse to smoke at the wheel of a moving vehicle and for obvious reasons, for one thing it is a light and  hot and if it were to be dropped on to the seat, can cause panic to the driver and possible distraction causeing an accident.\n\nThis is not a personnel attack on smokers, its just common sense that  hot ash can cause distraction to the driver if dropped and lands on the drivers seat.",
