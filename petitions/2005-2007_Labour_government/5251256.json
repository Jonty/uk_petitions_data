        "background": "the FA has contacted the club to advise that they intend to move the club from the southern league to the northern league if scarborough are forced out of a business. King's Lynn have spent a lot of time and money on preparation for the coming season chasing and securing southern league based players. This work will most likely be reversed by this inconsiderate arbitrary decision. This will effectively hinder this business' development and potential to succeed",
