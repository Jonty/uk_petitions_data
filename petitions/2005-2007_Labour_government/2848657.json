        "action": "alter the system concerning EMA payments to students due to unfair receivals of a number of individuals due to current flaws with the system.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The problem with the allocation of EMA payments is best outlined by drawing your attention to the following true and current situation. A 17 year old, year 13 grammar school student currently receives the full amount of EMA that can be possibly allocated. However, this is an injustice. His parents are divorced and he lives with his father and his father's girlfriend. His mother and father are both equally extremely wealthy to such an extent that his father retired at the age of 39. However, due to his father's apparent lack of income and his registration as living in the household and under the guardianship of his father (and not his mother) he receives the full amount of EMA as stated. Is this fair? No. To highlight the affluency of his parents your attention must be drawn to the fact that this student's brother had the pleasure of having his tuition fees, accommodation fees and other expenses paid for in part by his mother, his father and his grandmother when attending university.",
