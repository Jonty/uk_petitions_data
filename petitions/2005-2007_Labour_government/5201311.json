        "background": "For years high ranking politicans have been using the offical secrets act to cover up all their illegal activities and actions. I belive that it is time to put a stop to this pratice, as it is undemoractic, the rest of the country has to abide by the law and so to should ALL politicans. By making it illegal to misuse the offical secrets act, with a minium prison term of 5 years, all politicans might reconsider lying to the public whilst trying to hiding behind the offical secrets act.",
