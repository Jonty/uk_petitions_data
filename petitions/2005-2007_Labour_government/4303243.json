        "background": "I implore you all to sign this petition to stop the plans to teach children as young as 5 sex education in classrooms... Our children need to be protected from \"the deviants charter\" and petition the goverment to stop this. Some schools are using material which is not only crude but explicit also... A programme was recently aired to show a class of 10 year olds [boys & girls] how to put a condom on using \"dildo's\".. I find this situation \"demonic\" and \"horrific\" A recent article in the Daily Mail quoted a female t.v star as wanting children as young as 4 to be taught sex education. Our children's innocence is being stripped away from them and if your still not convinced just think how would you feel if your child of 4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 came home and sais \"daddy--- i learnt how to masturbate at school today\".",
