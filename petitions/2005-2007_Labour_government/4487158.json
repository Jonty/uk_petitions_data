Besides the fact these cameras will be costing the government an estimate \u00a3500,000 they are also a significant infringement of our civil liberties. \n\nWe are already the most watched nation on earth and are rapidly becoming a big brother society. With the installations of these talking cameras the government has further intruded into our every day life. It is time there was a stop to Britain becoming a \u2018surveillance society\u2019.",
