I see it most weeks (much more so than when i was a child (prior to 1988)and it seems to be getting worse. Even some adults condone it (just by their attitude and the way they speak alone). I see and hear evidence of this on a weekly basis so i know it goes on. People are getting sick and tired of not being able to do anything about it, or nothing being done to stop the problem escalating any further. It needs nipping in the bud and people need to be educated again and taught the values of respect.",
