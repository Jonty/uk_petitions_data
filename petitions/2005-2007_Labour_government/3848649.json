        "background": "As part of the development of the new UK Supreme Court, the Department for Constitutional Affairs is proposing to dismantle some of the most complete and unique 20th Century Gothic interiors in the World, located within Middlesex Guildhall in Parliament Square, London. \n\nIf the developer was anyone other than the government, planners would never have permitted this project.\n\nThese interiors were praised by Pevsner and have been described as the best court rooms in the country. If we want a modern Supreme Court than it should be built elsewhere and this building should continue as a Crown Court, the purpose for which it was originally intended.\n\nSAVE Britain's Heritage is seeking a judicial review of the decision, so your support will be of value in challenging this misguided proposal.",
