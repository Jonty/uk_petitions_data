            "background": "Under the Sex Discrimination Act 1975 it is unlawful to provide services exclusively for one sex. Therefore, as there is a Minister for Women there must also also be a Minister for Men. \nMen have been discriminated against in many areas for years. Just one example: in all the furore over some women not being able to get their pensions at age 60 as they had not made enough National Insurance contributions, no -one asked why women had been getting a state pension 5 years earlier than men anyway.\nA Minister for Men, one would hope, would have challenged this institutional sexism.\nFamily law, parental leave, healthcare are other areas of discrimination.\nPlease support this petition.",
