The OED defines a McJob as an \"unstimulating, low-paid job with few prospects\". While this may be derogatory to any workers at McDonald's, it is not up to a corporation to decide what is or isn't in the dictionary. The dictionary is a reflection of the language used by english speakers, not a marketing tool for big business.",
