        "background": "This is in response to a petition which requested the reverse: to ABOLISH Inheritance Tax by CUTTING public services.  This would disadvantage everyone who NEEDS public services and CAN'T AFFORD to pay for them themselves.  In my opinion Inheritance Tax is the least punitive tax because it is paid on the death of the tax-payer, and comes out of his/her estate, so that he/she is not personally affected at all.",
