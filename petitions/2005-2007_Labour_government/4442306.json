            "background": "At present full-time students over 19 must fill in an HC1 form with details of partners and dependents, rents, weekly expenses etc.  As the majority of full-time students are surviving on student loans and have no partners or dependents this just seems a waste of public money.  Each year, universities should provide a letter confirming each student's registration as a full time student. Most universities already do this.  This letter would provide proof of exemption from prescription charges.",
