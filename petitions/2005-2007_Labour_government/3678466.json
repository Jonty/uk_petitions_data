Similarly those who were born into poverty-stricken or human-rights-abusing countries had no control over that; why should they suffer as a result?  People say this is a small country but there are quite a few families who have 10 or more children; how does that contribute to over-crowding over several generations?  If we accept large families, in spite of being such a small country, we can't then logically call for a reduction in immigration numbers on those grounds.",
