            "background": "Currently, teachers work in a \"power to the pupil environment\". If a child misbehaves, their behaviour must be monitored and documented and witnessed by others for any disciplinary action to be taken. If a child decides he or she doesn\u2019t like the teacher, all it takes is one report, and that teacher is suspended. Surely this is the WRONG WAY ROUND. The teachers have no authority, and cannot enforce any kind of punishment on naughty children. They need to be given this authority back, both to protect the future of the career of teaching, and the future of education. If we carry on in this current environment where the word of any student is taken far more seriously than the word of any staff member, then we are looking at a future of anarchy in the classroom and a collapse of education. In order to protect both our hard-working, keen and interested teachers AND ALSO those children that make GENUINE grievances against staff, it is essential that the power is taken from the pupils and that ALL malicious accusers are dealt with in the courts and named, REGARDLESS of age.",
