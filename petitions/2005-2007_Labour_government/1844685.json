            "background": "Between 1932 and 1933 the Soviet Government systematically starved between 7,000, 000 and 11,000,000 Ukrainians to death by collecting all edible materials from Ukrainian villages. Western journalists delibarately concealed the famine. Western diplomats were aware of the situation but chose to ignore the largest programme of murder undertaken in peacetime Europe. The years before and after the famine saw a mass slaughter of Ukraine's writers, artists and middle class. We request that the Prime Minister takes the steps above to provide a measure of justice for the victims of the famine genocide and to ensure that an accurate history of Europe without this grotesque ommission is taught in British schools.",
