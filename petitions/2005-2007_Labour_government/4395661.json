        "action": "ensure that foreign Companies, like BAA, cease trading under acronyms implying that they are \u2018British\u2019, so that this country cannot be linked with ecological ill-effects caused by those companies",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "\u2018BAA\u2019 is an example where the acronym no longer stands for \u201cBritish Airports Authority,\u201d so, as the company is now Spanish owned, the \u2018B\u2019 should no longer be utilised by this company.  Britain should not be associated with foreign businesses profiting from the refusal to fully compensate for the atmospheric damage created by their procedures, in this case, flights taking off and landing at its facilities. Nor should \u2018British\u2019 be linked with the extra pollution caused by BAA refusing to assist in the installation of better rail facilities to the airports, preferring to use British land to create new car parks, giving it an even larger profit margin. As a foreign company, it is further damaging this country by encouraging other foreign firms to fly too many flights, demonstrated by the fact that free seats are offered to fly out of Britain.",
