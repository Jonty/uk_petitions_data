        "background": "As of 12:30 today Gordon Brown is the Leader of the majority party in Parliamnet and therefore the rightful Prime Minister. No one has challenged him for that position and therefore any internal Labour Party election for leader is not required. Any vote on the matter now would be nothing more than a quasi-communist rubber stamp of approval that the Soviet Communists would be proud of. When Governments fall there is an immediate transition from one PM to another (Major to Blair) as is the case when the leader of the majority party changes. Tony Blair may wish to remain as Prime Minister until 27th June but he is not now constitutionally entitled to do so now that no  election is required given that the next leader of the Labour Party has already been chosen without a contest.",
