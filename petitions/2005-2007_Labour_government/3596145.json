            "background": "If the gov\u2019t decided to help taxpayers on home projects where they\u2019re trying to improve our global impact then more people might be encouraged to make changes to homes to help the environment and save on monthly costs. Solar power may not be as useful in the UK as it may be in Spain, but wind power here is a very useful source of energy.  Attaching a small turbine to your roof would save monthly electric costs, which in turn would cut down on Britains\u2019 burning of fossil fuels, thus cutting emissions. This is a win-win situation for the gov\u2019t, the taxpayer and the world. Less emissions mean the gov\u2019t wouldn't have to explore new sources of power (nuclear) as there would be less draw on the grid from the users.  In fact, there should be a rollout to some test areas of these energy-saving technologies on the household to see what the impact would be on the grid. This, in conjunction with citizens doing their part (recycling, watching energy use, etc.) would be a useful spend.",
