            "background": "Replacement of Trident would be a grotesque waste of resources which would be much better spent on supporting conventional defence services as well as the country's infrastructure, carbon reduction and welfare services. It would give no protection against terrorism and it is unimaginable that it would be used, making it an ineffective deterrent. Actual use would be immoral and retention exposes the hypocrisy of preaching non-proliferation to other countries.",
