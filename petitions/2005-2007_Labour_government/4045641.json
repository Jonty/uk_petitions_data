You will be supported by the team, which may include midwives, obstetricians, paediatricians, physiotherapists and the hospital chaplain. \nAre these issues not important enough for the NHS? Why should we not have this scan? \nPlease support my petition.Due to cuts and funding the system is in a mess and leaves us parents to be in a place we would rather not be.",
