            "background": "Referring to statutory holidays as \"Bank Holidays\" is an anachronism, given that banks are starting to open on bank holidays.  Instead, the term \"Bank\" holiday should be amended to \"Family Holiday\" to emphasise the importance of spending that time with your family and the work/life balance.  If possible, people should be allowed to take these days holiday whenever they want, rather than everyone taking to the roads and overwhelming services on a particular day.",
