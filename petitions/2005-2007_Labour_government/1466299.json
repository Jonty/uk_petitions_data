            "background": "I think it ought to be illegal for companies to penalise employees by red circling their salaries as a direct result of Company incompetence or negligence.  Why should employees suffer because the business got it wrong?  Being denied additional benefits linked to the growth of your salary through no fault of your own is absolutely absurd.  \nCompanies should either re-instate the status quo or compensate the employee for the loss of increase in salary and benefits.\nIf an action falls between legal headings, then  the employee ought to be able to launch a case against an employer (Free of charge with the employer having to pay for all costs related to the case).\nCompanies manage and massage situations to suit themselves and the employee is rendered powerless from a cost and legal perspective.",
