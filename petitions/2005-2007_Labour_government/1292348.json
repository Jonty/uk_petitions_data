            "background": "More & more single responder vehicles are being deployed by Ambulance Trusts in order to achieve the target response times for life threatening calls.  I do acknowledge that as a Paramedic on my own I am able to initiate live saving treatment, but not as well, or as quickly as when I am on a double crewed ambulance.  We need the funding for more real ambulances & need to cut back on single responders.  The ONLY vehicle able to deal with the full range of ambulance emergencies is a double manned frontline NHS ambulance.  Give us more of these & patient care will then improve AS WELL AS the statistics for response times!!!",
