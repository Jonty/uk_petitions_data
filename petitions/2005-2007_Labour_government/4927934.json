            "background": "If the government is to have any credibility as a promoter of green policies, it needs to do its bit as a promoter of the use of green energy.\n\nCurrently, the United Kingdom has one of the highest levels of fuel duty applied to biofuel in Europe.  This helps to make the use of biofuel unattractive to the public and perpetuate the use of fossil fuels.\n\nWe urge the government to make biofuel free of any duty for the present time, in order that more of the public consdider its use as a real alternative.  We accept that when biofuels become 'mainstream' fuel duty is inevitable.\n\nWe would also ask the government to be mindfull of the fact that certain production methods are in fact harmfull to the environment, globally.  For example, the destruction of rain forest to grow palm oil.  If a policy of rewarding 'good' biofuels could be introduced, so much the better.",
