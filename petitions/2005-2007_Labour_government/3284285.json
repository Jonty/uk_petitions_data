            "background": "As we are all aware there are congestion problems on the roads, but rather than push the poorer from the roads with extra TOLL CHARGES, bearing in mind how much a car costs to keep on the road already. I offer another approach to the problem; why not reduce the numbers on the road, by raising the minimum age limit, to at least be in line with Drinking, Watching a Movie,  things which are considered to be required to have an 'adult' frame of mind. Yet their allowed to drive around our roads. Ideally 21 would be a massive amount of benefit to ALL road users and could help those extra insurance costs, amongst many other benefits I'm sure there is room for debate. We below wish this avenue to at least have a fair hearing before moving to TOLL roads.",
