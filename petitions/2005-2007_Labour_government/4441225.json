            "background": "I write to sadly highlight a great miscarriage of justice taking place right now in the United States of America which has led to the victimisation and subsequent incarceration of an innocent man who was wrongly sentenced to  a staggering 135 years in prison. As far as I can see, based on further intensive research, prior to this mans arrest in May 2002, the local authorities in Putnam county were already involved in disputes regarding various zoning issues among other things which based on my research points towards a personal vendetta towards This gentleman from The local Sherriff.In the present climate whereby the injustices suffered by millions of Africans/African Americans is at the forefront of the social conscious, it\u2019s ironic and sad that the very mental sickness that brought about the brutality and injustice to millions is still very much alive on the shores of the United States of America today.  It is my sincere hope that you will intervene  on behalf of truth and justice and I sincerely feel that the gesture of your attention in this matter would be a torchlight for democracy and justice and an example for the world to follow.",
