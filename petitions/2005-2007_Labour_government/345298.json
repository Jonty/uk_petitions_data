        "background": "We support the campaign by Compassion in World Farming and the RSPCA to end the trade in live calves to the continent.  We will call upon our MPs to sign Early Day Motion 395 in support.\n\nIn May 2006, exports of live calves resumed with tens of thousands of young calves suffering on journeys that can take over 60 hours.  On reaching the continent, calves are often kept in barren systems such as veal crates, with welfare standards so low that they are illegal in the UK.  \n\nWe call upon the Government to work with the dairy and beef sectors to develop humane and economically viable uses for male dairy calves, replacing the live export trade with a trade in meat carcasses.",
