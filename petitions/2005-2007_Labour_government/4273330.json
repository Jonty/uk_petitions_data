            "background": "This petition proposes that car insurance companies should not be allowed to charge a customer more for car insurance simply because of their age. It is not fair that a 20 year old who has been driving for 3 years and has never had an accident, should pay more than a 40 year old who has just passed their test and already had an accident. Furthermore, this petition proposes that ALL drivers, regardless of age, pay the SAME rate until they have an accident for which they are to blame.\nAgeism was supposed to have become officially illegal several months ago, however it is still rife in the car insurnce industry. Let's put a stop to this now.",
