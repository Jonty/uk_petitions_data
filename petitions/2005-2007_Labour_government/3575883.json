            "background": "The Land Reform (Scotland) Act 2003 establishes a statutory right of responsible access to land and inland waters for outdoor recreation, crossing land, and some educational and commercial purposes. However in England and Wales access law is far more restrictive and archaic, severely restricting access to land for many users such as cyclists and more particularly access to inland waters for canoeists. This situation is almost unique in Europe and indeed the rest of the world - in most other countries free access is allowed to tracks and inland waterways for all non-motorised users. Indeed such a policy even exists in one part of the UK. We call for the sensible access arrangement in Scotland to apply to the rest of the UK.",
