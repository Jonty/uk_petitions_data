            "background": "Many people in Britain remain concerned that there is a lingering threat of losing our currency at some point in the near future, which is so much a part of our national heritage and cultural identity. Symbolically it would represent submitting the last tangible icon of our Britishness, and of our sovereignty, to the larger European state, not to mention a significant compromise of our fiscal control over our own economy. The lack, to date, of a Referendum to establish the opinion of the public on this and a number of other European issues, is concerning. I believe the British people have a right to voice their opinions on the future of our currency.",
