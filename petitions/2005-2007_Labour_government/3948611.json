            "background": "the price to get HRT on prescription is double what it is to get any other prescriptions.  WHY? The government and GP's tell menopausal women it is because there is more than 1 ingredient in it.  So does practically every other type of medication out there.  \n\nWhy should woman be made to pay double the cost for something that is a necessity when going through the menopause.\n\nSign this petition if you believe this is unfair. Prescriptions should be charged per item, not per ingredient.  If not, then it should be imposed on all medication with more than one ingredient and not just HRT",
