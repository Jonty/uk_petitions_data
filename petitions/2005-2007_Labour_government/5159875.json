        "background": "I wish for it to be law that places on buses that are availble for wheelchair users must be made available by law.  There are people that will refuse to move leaving a wheelchair user unable to travel untill the next bus comes along.  This is 2007 and people with disabilitys should be able to move freely with in there citys and towns.  Most buses have spaces for wheelchairs but by law they do not have to be made availble, anyone can sit there and refuse to move.  I want to make it law that these places must be given up to someone in a wheelchair, rather than say a disability as anyone can claim disability.  Someone with a wheelchair who is taking the steps to use public transport must have life made a little more easy but allowing them just one simple place on a bus.",
