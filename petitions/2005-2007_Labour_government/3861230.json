            "background": "The local Town Council are proposing to sell the allotments at Days Field, Swaffham for the purpose of housing development.  These allotments have been cultivated by the townspeople of Swaffham for over a century.  They are currently fully occupied and are accessible and convenient to those especially who live in the local vicinty.  The Town Council without any consultation with the townfolk or allotment holders have decided to sell off this land to make money.  We need support from any quarter in our quest to reverse this undemocratic decision.  If the Council is not stopped these allotments will be lost to future generations forever.  Please help us by signing this Petition.",
