This might bring people from all over the UK to it, and it could be created closer to Scotland but be in the centre of the UK this way scots wont feel the 'being ruled all the way from London issue' and it would be the most advanced city in the world. *And the Uk wouldnt be the first country to do this as, Brazil and many other nations have done so.\n\n\n*I propose a name like Britannia City would be appropriate as it represents the UK.",
