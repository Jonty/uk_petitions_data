            "background": "I call upon the government to act in favour of removing luxury items from long term prisoners who have been convicted of murder, rape or indecent acts against children. \n\nConvicted prisoners should not be allowed luxury items whilst in prison. No personal television, No personal radio, No computer or games console, No tobacco, No chocolate or sweets. \n\nAccess to newspapers and magazines should be strictly limited to restricted material of a rather mundane nature. \n\nThese extended luxury human rights of prisoners on long term sentances should be removed as part of their punishment for ruining victims and their families lives.",
