Yet the rules of the ICC mean that unless they are banned by their Government from going they play or become disqualified.\n\nMichael Howard's Government in Australia thinks leaving it to the players  is unfair and has banned Australian players from visiting Zimbabwe. He has appealed to to other Governments to follow suit. I agree.",
