We feel the process should start with heroin addicts recieving clean supplies of actual heroin. These should be taken in 'shooting galleries' under supervision and remain available so long as the addict comits no criminal offences. When the addict wishes to quit, there should be help available.Punish criminal addicts, do not make addiction criminal. If this works, then set up schemes for cocaine etc.",
