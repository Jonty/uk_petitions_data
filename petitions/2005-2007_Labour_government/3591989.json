            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Most government departments are significantly reliant on software from foreign multinationals such as Microsoft. All of these substantial licencing costs then generate funds for foreign corporations, taking money out of our own economy. If the emphasis is put on using Open Source and locally-developed solutions, then the IT investment is redirected towards local IT services employment, benefitting the economy. Existing infrastructure (such as existing desktop operating systems) would not be replaced without good reason, but the intended progression would be towards making less use of foreign commercial software over time.",
