            "background": "Just under a year ago, Plaistow station have installed new indicator boards on 3 platforms. By the first 3 months or so, the indicator boards were working in good order. Then the district line had a severe problem one day & most of the line was suspended.\nWhen that problem was over, the indicator board at the 3 platforms have not worked or displayed any \"next train\" information for the last 10 months since this present day & this is still continuing right now!!!\n\nWhy would the London Underground maintainence staff take down the old boards that were working & replace them with new ones that aren't working?\n\nAlso most stations near Plaistow have their indicator boards working such as West Ham, East Ham, Upton Park, Mile End, etc but not Plaistow.\n\nI have e-mailed the London Underground twice about this problem & their response is that it will be sorted or \"upgraded\" in 2010!!! \n\nI am asking you, the public to sign this petition to get this problem addressed to the government.\n\nThank You.",
