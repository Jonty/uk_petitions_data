        "background": "How is it possible that a person can be charged under UK law for defending their own person, home, family, or belongings on their own property, from being damaged, stolen, injured or even killed, by someone that has no right to be there in the first place?\nIf you don't stop an intruder you lose something valuable to you, in whatever form that takes.  If you stop them by force, (And there may well be no other way), you will probably face criminal proceedings! How can someone breaking the law be allowed to sue you for defending what you have worked so hard for!  The moment somebody enters your property uninvited, they should lose all their so-called 'human rights'.",
