            "background": "Road charging is a direct tax on all goods which require transport by road.\nSuch a tax will force companies to do one of three things,1- Pass the charges on to the consumer,driving prices up. 2- Try to absorb the tax, reducing profitabillity and therefore the scope for expansion and job creation.3- cease to be viable and go out of business, adding to unemployment.\nDue to the almost complete butchering of rail frieght in the past, we have no other option but to use the roads, for which we already pay the lions share of tax.\n A complete re-think is therefore needed with a view to developing transport alternatives, and discouraging wastefull driving habits.",
