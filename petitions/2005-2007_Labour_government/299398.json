        "background": "An independent Lords cannot be assured if it is drawn by election (as is proposed) as it will either leave one party with a mandate to pass any law it deems fit leading to a possible dictatorship or on the other hand if the loser in Commons elections is elected to Lords then it would be fair to assume there will be a considerable elongation of the time before a bill receives assent.\nAs the recent 'CASH FOR HONOURS' scandal shows the dominant commons party could be seen to be abusing its position by using the power to appoint lords as a fundraising method. Giving the monarch the power would still allow parties to suggest a possible lord through the same system as normal members of the public use and would thus make it more democratic and allow a more independent and representative house.\nAlso it would by maintaining current system of payments and titles (new Member of the Lords/ML title proposed) keep the costs of maintenance and the prestige of the house as is.",
