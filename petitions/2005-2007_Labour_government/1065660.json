Many men lost their lives and others were seriously injured during this conflict.  In order to show its gratitude and RESPECT, Her Majesty's Government must ensure that a senior member of parliament attends the island ceremony to commemorate this conflict and not use the excuse that the weather will be UNPLEASANT and CHILLY - probably the same as it was for the armed forces when the conflict took place.",
