Voices are the property of people, not a company, and we are not remunerated, nor given permission for our voices to be used. Legislation is needed to enforce companies not to use these for training without prior consent or payment. The fact they say MAY means they are not even telling the truth and need to be regulated in this area.  Most of the calls we don't have a choice not to make. Do you want your voice held and used without your permission, and not be paid for it? Actors are paid. Sign here and put a stop to it now!!",
