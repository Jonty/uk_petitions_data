            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Despite the cost of private transport in terms of time lost to jams and money spent on fuel and taxes, many still chose to drive their car to work. As a result city centre bus-services are crippled, cycling is dangerous, commercial traffic suffers, air-quality suffers, and the nation becomes obese.\n\nBy banning greenhouse-emitting commuter transport we can support environmentally friendly transport, encourage health, and release bus routes from the prohibitive weight of traffic that they presently compete with.\n\nThe majority of those who drive to work will quickly adapt. Businesses and councils will be driven by demand to provide facilities to support changed habits where required. Inadequacies in public transport will be alleviated by the increase in revenue.\n\nPredictions of doom were widespread when the London congestion charge was introduced. London continues to thrive. To break the commuter driving habit in all our cities further ground-breaking legislation is required.",
