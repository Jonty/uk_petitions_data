        "background": "These seagulls are just pests in our city - creating noise pollution and health issues with their waste and an annoyance with their aggressiveness - if you live in the city of Gloucester you'll know there are more seagulls than at the seaside, attracted here by the tip right next to the city centre.\n\nThe local council has been too timid to effectively solve this problem - the only solution is to have the seagull population culled as soon as possible.",
