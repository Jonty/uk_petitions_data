            "background": "A brand identity is crucial to selling a product. The Olympic Games are a product this country needs to sell. To recoup the billions of pounds of UK taxpayer investment, it is imperative that merchandising is a success. However, I cannot envisage tourists rushing to buy a t-shirt adorned with this monstrosity.\n\nThe logo has connotations of graffiti and street youth culture, is this really the principle impression of London we want to give to the world? I accept that getting young people interested in the Olympics is a worthwhile endeavour, but this logo is not the answer (the ongoing investment in sports coaches, youth orientated sports centres, and sports bursaries are an answer).\n\nIt is my opinion that in five years this logo will look dated and tired, crucially- not the symbol of a nation\u2019s pride.\n\nWe implore the prime minister to intervene.",
