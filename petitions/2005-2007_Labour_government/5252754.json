            "background": "With the Government committed to encouraging people to use alcohol responsibly, and the allowance of pubs to open longer so that people do not all have to cram in as much drinking as possible in before a set time, it seems ridiculous to me that pubs are still allowed to have \"happy hours\".\n\nThese are time-limited promotional periods in which prices are reduced, therefore encouraging people to buy and drink as much as they can within a relatively short space of time - precisely what reforming opening hour licensing laws was supposed to be stopping.\n\nI would propose a very simple piece of legislation to ban pubs from offering alcohol at reduced rates on a time-limited basis.\n\nThis needn't stop price promotions or people enjoying themselves - any promotions would still be allowed, just not on time-limited basis - they should be available at all times on any given day from the time the pub opens to the time it shuts - therefore there is no pressure to buy as many drinks as possible in a set period of time and drink faster, and more, than you otherwise would have, but you still get the benefit of special deals. Everyone wins!",
