I believe because of the recent support the armed forces has shown in the confict in Iraq and Afganistan they should be ellagible for a tax free wage as a thankyou from this country for making it safe. If you have read the recent tabloids you will see the poor conditions some have to stay in and thats in the UK! Our boys should be getting treated better and this is just an idea of repaying the huge debt we owe to them.",
