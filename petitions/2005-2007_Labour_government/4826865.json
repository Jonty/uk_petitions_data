            "background": "Household rubbish fires are a nuisance, and unnecessary. Most, if not all the items that are burnt can be recycled. My personal reasons for this petition are as follows:\n\n- Firstly a pleasant evening sat outside can be ruined by the smell, smoke and ash heading your way.\n\n- You cannot leave / put washing out early evening (sometimes even earlier for those who don't obey the smokeless - not before 6pm rule) \n\n- The amount of clean up required if ash has been strewn all around (particularly annoying if you had ceaned cars / windows / swept the yard that morning)\n\n- The environmental impact of the emissions created.\n\n- The ability to recycle paper, cardboard, garden waste and wood which are usually the main make-up of such fires.\n\n- The risk of getting out of control if the fire is not properly handled.\n\nPlease ban these household fires all together (instead of the current not before 6pm rule) There are other options available, which appear to make this easily implemented.",
