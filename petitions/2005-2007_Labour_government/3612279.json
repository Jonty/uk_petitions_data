            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Introduce legislation to allow the Health and Safety Executive to encourage the installation of exercise bikes in the corners of all offices if the workforce request it, so that stressed office workers can exercise their stress away and improve their mental health, anger management, stress levels, office camaraderie, joy, fitness, oxygen levels to the brain, concentration, sense of humour, sense of balance, sense of perspective and team spirit. This would not be about having one bike hidden in a distant corner of a huge building, this would be about having one bike in every office if the staff request it, as many people in call centres are unable to leave work stations without logging out using a swipe card and many workers feel trapped and resentful inside their beautiful carpeted sweatshops and this is inhuman and contributes to anxiety and distress.",
