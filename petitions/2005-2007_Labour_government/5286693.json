            "background": "Many riders who also travel by air cannot risk their helmet being lost or delayed and prefer to carry it on-board. This is akin to not checking-in your wallet and keys.\n\nDamage caused to a checked-in helmet, due to inappropriate handling by \"baggage throwers\", may  be invisible - and unknown - until the helmet is called upon to protect the rider's head in an incident.\n\nManufacturers typically recommend owners transport their helmet in specially designed bags.\n\nAt Heathrow, due to increased security measures, such a helmet is currently considered your \"one item\" - if it happens to also fit the strict size restrictions.\n\nExemptions to the \"one item only\" rule already apply for musical instruments, child seats, pushchairs, walking aids and wheelchairs. Why not these vital, fragile, and MANDATORY pieces of safety equipment too?",
