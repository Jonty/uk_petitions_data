            "background": "Most of the UKs Internet Service Providers (ISPs) that advertise \"unlimited\" broadband are in fact lying. They are using various methods e.g. Fair Usage Policies and reduce download speeds, that effectively place limits on users. What I am proposing is this, unlimited should mean unlimited. Apart from contention issues (the number of broadband users in a telephone exchange) ISPs should not be able to use any method to limit usage of \"unlimited\" broadband",
