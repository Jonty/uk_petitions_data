        "background": "Disabled children have little access to childcare, either formal or informal and a high proportion of families with disabled children live in poverty. Local Authorities need to be enabled to provide statutory funding for childcare places for disabled children - including those with the most severe disabilities - to enable their parents to work. Childcare must be equivalent to that on offer for non-disabled children.",
