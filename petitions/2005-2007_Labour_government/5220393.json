            "background": "Recent policy changes in the name of political correctness are proving unpopular with forces personnel.\n\nThe first, to remove traditional nose art from RAF aircraft smacks in the face of tradition and morale. Since the inception of the RAF nose art has been popular among aircrew. Some, not all, displayed risque images of women. No female personnel have complained about the images, but they are to be scrubbed away.\n\n\nThe second, to ban the display of page3 girl cutouts in RN lockers is also a step against personnel's human rights, the content of these lockers is considered private and should not be subject to regulations which attempt to control what personnel can see when they are not on duty.\n\nThe next step in these PC dance might be to ban FHM from MoD establishments. A publication hugely popular with all British personnel.\n\nAt a time when the government is trimming back the Armed Forces, why do they mobilise a PC brigade?",
