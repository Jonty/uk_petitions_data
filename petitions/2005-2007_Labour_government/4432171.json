            "background": "The amount of congestion on the roads around rush hour is an increasing problem, which has already been highlighted many times. I believe this congestion is due to the amount of parents taking children to school in the car, a high number of which seem to be 4x4's, which we all know are harmful to the environment. If parents found alternative ways of getting their children to and from school i.e public transport or walking this would reduce Carbon emissions, thus saving rising taxes and the environment at the same time reducing unnecessary congestion at already busy times, and will give children the valuable exercise they need.",
