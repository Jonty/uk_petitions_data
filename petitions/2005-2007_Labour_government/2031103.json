            "background": "Taking a lie detector test would confirm the suspicions of the police and help in the prosecution of terrorists and violent criminals. It would NOT replace a thorough investigation of the evidence. No-one would be able to refuse on the grounds of it being against their human rights - if guilty they would have taken away other peoples' human rights; if not guilty it would save their human rights being taken away through false imprisonment.",
