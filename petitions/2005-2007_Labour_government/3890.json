            "background": "The current justice system in the UK requires an individual to commit multiple crimes, creating multiple victims, costing innocent people thousands of pounds and sometimes their lives before a court will use it's power and lock them up.  Yet once locked up they are then released early.  e.g. The maximum sentence available to the judge for the offence of causing death by dangerous driving is 14 years, yet rarely does the convicted party recieve more than 5 years.  We are at a point where the feelings and lives of good, honest, law abiding citizens wanting to better themselves and this country are considered second class to the selfish individuals and criminals who escape time and time again with \u00a350 fines and 2-5 year terms for killing people.    Please introduce minimum sentences of the order of 15-25 years and relax for no one.",
