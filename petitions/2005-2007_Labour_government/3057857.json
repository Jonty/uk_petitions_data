            "background": "Over 250 cases of Renault Clio Mark II bonnets flying open during normal use have been reported to Watchdog and Renault, but Renault is accepting no responsibility. Renault needs to recall these cars and accept responsibility. I have lost hundreds of pounds due to my bonnet safety catch failing on the motorway, and could have lost my life. Renault have refused to look at the bonnet catch, and will not look into the case any further. We cant let them get away with it - how far does it have to go? Who needs to die before they do something about it?",
