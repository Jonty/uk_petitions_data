        "background": "Con-artists are befriending, living with & marrying in order to gain money & destroy their victims lives, through joint accounts, credit cards, loans, borrowing money, & basically deceiving their victims any way they can. \n\nThe police should look into all allogations & treat this as a very serious crime.\n\nThe con-artist, & anyone working with them should get a criminal record, be named & shamed, made to pay back all they owe by working, which should be done under police guard & tagged. The tax payer should'nt have to pay for this, it should come out of the con-artist's earnings.\n\nIt's imperative that they should have all their rights taken away, ie passport, bank accounts, business.\n\nCompensation should be paid to the victim straight away, the victim's MP & local police should support the victim, so they do not lose their homes etc. Many con-artists will totally destroy their victims lives by losing them jobs etc, their victims are left in a state of despair.\n\nThe public should be made fully aware of what is happening so they can protect themselves. \n\nIt does not matter how long you have known the con-artist for, they care nothing of this, but gaining money & destroying lives.",
