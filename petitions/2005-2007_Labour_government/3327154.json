            "background": "We at www.royalmailchat.co.uk realise that changes are needed since the opening of the Mail Market  to competition.\nAdd the fact that RM seem to be slow off the mark with dealing with it,RM are now in trouble.\nAlso with RM taking a 10+yrs Pension break,our Pension scheme has a serious shortfall.\nRM's answer is to cut jobs,we realise some jobs will go and the way we work will change.\nBut it's how the changes are being made with bully management trying to force ridiculous and unrealistic changes on us which will only lower morale and affect the service we give.\nThe way it's being done needs to stop,we accept changes but not in this way,we want to talk but not in the way it's being done.\nTherefore royalmailchat and the staff of RM ask the Prime Minister to intervene and help us make the changes in a more civilised and more productive way and help us to help him get RM back to where it should be.",
