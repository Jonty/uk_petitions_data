They are unable to get life/health insurance which then means they are unable to obtain mortgages/loans.  \n\nThe main clause is \"ongoing medical treatment\".  This means that unless you don't attend hospital for five years you are eligible for health/life insurance.  Cancer and other long term illnesses do not allow you to be free of hospital appointments.  Therefore patients are penalised.",
