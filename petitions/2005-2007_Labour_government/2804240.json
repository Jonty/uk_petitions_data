            "background": "The Government needs to recognise that a major immigration crisis is unfolding before its eyes. There is a tide of economic migration flooding in and the country is breaking under the strain and many with a profession who can are fed up paying astronomical taxes of every kind to fund the ridiculous spiralling cost of the welfare state. \n\nOur Hospitals are FULL. All The Prisons are full.  The roads are congested.  There is a water shortage, a housing shortage, etc etc.\n\nThe local Schools (especially single sex and faith schools) are struggling on a tide of non-English speaking children who appear almost on a daily basis. \n\nIt is time for the Government to close the doors and introduce strict controls.  and to ignore the ignorant race-hate hysteria of the very few who would disagree with the policy.\n\nHow can it be a bad idea to be careful whom you allow  to come and settle in your country?",
