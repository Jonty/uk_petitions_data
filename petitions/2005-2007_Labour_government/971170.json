            "background": "Family pets are important members of the family.  They are living beings and deserve to have rights.  Stealing a member of the family is a deadful thing to do.  Dogs in particular need their pack/family, and if you are lucky enough to have a dog in your family, they mean the world to you.\n\nTo steal a family pet, should be a very serious offence, not just treated as theft of an object.  A pet is not just an object, it is family!  Your family!  It deserves protection under the law!  \n\nPlease sign my petition and push animal rights to the next level.\n\nThank you",
