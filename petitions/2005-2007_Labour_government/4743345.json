With Carrick and Hargreaves in front of the back four, the former using his distribution skills whilst the latter plays the holding role, and a fluid three of Joe Cole, Steven Gerrard and Wayne Rooney behind a sole front man such as Alan Smith, Peter Crouch or, when fit, Michael Owen, England can get on the path to glory. Clearly Steve McLaren has just not considered this and only needs it mentioning to him in order for the magic to take effect.",
