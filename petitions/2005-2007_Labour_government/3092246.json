            "background": "The BBC allegedly surveyed the British public with regard to the TV License fees. According to the Corporation, \u201cpeople would not mind paying more for better quality programmes\u201d.   I have yet to find one person who agrees with the necessity to purchase a TV License let alone continue paying more and more for a poor quality service.   If The BBC really believes the British public want to fund the Corporation why not go pay per view and put an end to the enforced license requirement?  We are told the UK is a free country, really?",
