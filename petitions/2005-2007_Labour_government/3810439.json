            "background": "It is apparent that many older people are not given the necessary testing to determine whether they are suffering from cancer.  Patients are often referred from General Practice with mis-diagnosed musculo-skeletal complaints as it is often assumed that aches and pains can only be related to these.  This then delays any future treatments when cancer is eventually diagnosed,  often resulting in a negative outcome.  The provisioning for routine testing where cancer could be an option is necessary to give elderly people the chance to live out their lives to their full potential without succumbing to cancer at an early age.",
