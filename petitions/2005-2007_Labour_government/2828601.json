Let it be safe, so they cannot be seriously harmed; but just humiliated in front of their peers. If they have harrassed an old couple - for example - let that old couple be the first to throw wet sponges at them (provided by the council/cheaper than a night in the cells). A security guard could be on site to prevent damage to the case and the person inside it. It will work better than Asbo's as no-one will want it repeated! Hard to see the acclaimed cudos on this one.",
