        "background": "This petition has been set up and signed by a 15 year old school boy who's taking his GCSE's this year and is fed up with stupid restrictions at school. No longer can you play on the grass for fear from the school that someone mayfall and so sue the school for liabilities, and how can this happen? health and saftey laws of course being used as a tool to prosecuteand restrict the livesof many in our country. Iam not making this petitiontoget rid of all the health and safety laws but i just want the ones which make no sense, \"we cant goon the trip due to health and saftey\" \"no sorry you cant go there duetohealth and safety\", lifted so that the government  wakes up and gives new jobs for the people who are obviously bored with their work as more and more obsurd laws are made everyday from their \"factory of fun\"",
