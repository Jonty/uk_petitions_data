            "background": "Higher home values do not benefit the average home owner who buys a home to live in,not primarily as an investment.  The only way to benefit from these absurd house prices would be to sell your home and go to live in a very cheap mobile home.We the people are worried that politicians will see these, in effect hypothetical increases in value as a green light for even more taxation. This is not justified as the average house owner is richer on paper, but not in any real everyday sense. A great many people on small incomes or pensions already see the council tax as less fair than the poll-tax. We ask you to consider the alternatives to this hated tax.",
