        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Roundabouts are a much better, fairer, and more fluid way of dealing with junctions etc. People who can not use roundabouts properly should not be awarded with a valid driving licence! This would make the driving test a higher standard, and cause less accidents, never mind the waste of energy that traffic lights use, that the Government seems to care so much about, despite the UK not making the slightest bit of difference to Global warming.",
