        "background": "The elderly of Great Britain are as vulnerable as our children and thus should be as protected by law in the same way.  Too often we hear in the media of elderly abuse, whether it be in nursing homes, care homes, hospitals or wherever but because they are elderly they do not seem to be deemed important, which is disgusting and says very little for the society and laws of our country and this needs to change.",
