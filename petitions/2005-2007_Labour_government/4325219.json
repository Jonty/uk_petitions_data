            "background": "It is a national disgrace that the British citizen has to pay extra or go to a public vicinity just to watch their national football team. Football is famously renowned for its roots back to England and the English league is still the most followed league in the world. As a nation we should be able to follow are national team from the comfort of our own homes without having to pay another subscription to another 3rd party. I appreciate that TV rights are bid for but the big players like SKY just get bigger and our national BBC can not compete. The government should stop this stranglehold that the bigger corporations have and give back to the British people what belongs to them.",
