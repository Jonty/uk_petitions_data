        "action": "educate the motoring public, by the use of a television advertising (as for speeding & drink driving), how and when to indicate at a roundabout and what lane to use when entering a roundabout to reduce congestion, accidents and increase road safety & consideration for other motorists",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There are defined rules in The Highway Code for indicating and for choosing which lane the motorist needs to be in for entering and exiting a roundabout. However, from my day to day driving it is blatantly clear that the majority of drivers do not know, or do not follow these rules. Advertisements should be made on TV describing in a clear fashion how to indicate and how to choose a lane for entering and exiting a roundabout, and has been done on Australian television in the past. Obeying these rules around roundabouts should be enforceable. This would increase road safety at and around roundabouts, increase consideration for other motorists and in turn reduce accidents and congestion.",
