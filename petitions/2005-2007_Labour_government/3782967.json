        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "We propose that a new secular Public Holiday be added to the calendar. We petition the Office of Prime Minister to establish March 25th as 'Slavery Memorial Day', a national public holiday, commemorating 40million Africans who lost their lives, fought and survived the horrors of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade. A trade that Britain prospered from to the detriment of others solely because of skin colour and financial gain. March 25th 2007 sees the bicentenary of the 1807 Slave trade Act, which was presented to parliament on 24th March 1807 and was passed on 25th March after previously being defeated no less than 20 times during the course of 30 years. So there would be no better time to make this day a national public holiday in recognition of this important event in British history. The bicentenary of the Act of Abolition is our chance to acknowledge the united kingdoms role in slavery and ensure that we remember and understand that period in time and the legacy we have all inherited",
