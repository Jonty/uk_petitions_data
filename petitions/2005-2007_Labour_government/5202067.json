It is totally meaningless, uninspiring, anything but iconic and an absolute waste of almost half a million tax payer pounds. Scrap the current logo and allow UK residents to submit their own with a chance to win tickets to all Olympic events. This will guarantee a much better logo, made with more thought and care than an incredibly overrated and untalented design company can muster.",
