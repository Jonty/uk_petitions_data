In addition, the \"shoot to kill\" policy should be revoked and reasonable force should only be used where there is a clear and present threat to human life, which was missing in this case.An innocent foreign National, a Brazilian, was shot by police seven times in the head and once in the shoulder, whist he was going about his legal and peaceful business.\nPolice used unreasonable force, over and above that which was required, in the situation.\nPolice should apply reasonable force in situations where a life or the lives of themselves or others are at risk.  This was not present in the case of the innocent foreign National, a Brazilian.",
