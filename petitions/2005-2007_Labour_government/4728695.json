            "background": "Last week, the morning Tidal flow system at the Blackwall Tunnel was ended by Police and TFL after 30 years on \"safety\" grounds. We all know the real reason why TFL wanted to end the system, so that congestion builds up, then Ken Livingstone can impose Congestion Charging on the Blackwall Tunnel. I urge as many people as possible to sign this petition, to show Ken Livingstone that we won't be bullied into paying something that is not needed. I quote Bob Neill, London Assembly Member for Bexley and Bromley, he said, \"The tidal flow system has worked well without any serious incidents for years tackling some of the worst congestion in London.\" So answer is to reinstate the Tidal Flow, and NOT impose Congestion Charging.",
