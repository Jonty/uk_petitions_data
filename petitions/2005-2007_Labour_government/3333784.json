The next highest numbers at the end of the anti road charging petition was just 85,894 (to scrap inheritance tax) and then 31,902 (to repeal the Hunting Act 2004).\n\nIf 1.8 million people cannot influence the PM to do any more than re-iterate the same old 'clap-trap' as we had just voicing our objection to, then close the site down.  Keeping it going will only make the people realise this is not a free country after all and then start looking at other matters more critically (like how we are being duped into a federal Europe).\n\nYour vote on this petition is a vote of NO CONFIDENCE in the E-Petition concept.",
