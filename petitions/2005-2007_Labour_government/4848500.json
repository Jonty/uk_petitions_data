American company Peer bullied, deceived and manipulated musicians into signing contracts, of at best dubious legality, both in the 1930s and 1990s. They are trying to avoid paying Cuban musicians the royalties due to them, on technicalities. This is morally wrong. Peer are simply greedy, and/ or do not want to pay money to Cubans. Yet another example of US aggression towards Cuba.",
