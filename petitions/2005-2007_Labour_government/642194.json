            "background": "Sharks are the more unheard of endangered species, fished for their valuable fins, meat and oils. Humans kill over 100 million sharks a year, and by 2017, 20 species of shark will be extinct including the dosile whale shark and basking shark, indiginous to our coasts, both being the two largest fish in the sea. This also includes the phenomonal great white, the most misunderstood animal on the planet and the most likely to become extinct because of people's ignorance to them. So please help to raise awarness of this extremely important problem and do something to stop these animals, which out lived the dinosaurs, survive in our man-slaughtering world of today, and save the entire marine eco-chain from collasping.",
