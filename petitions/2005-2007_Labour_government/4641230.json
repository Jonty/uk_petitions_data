            "background": "The people of Cornwall have long paid exorbitant rates for their water in order to subidise the tourist industry, through measures such as the \"clean sweep\" program.\n\nThe following measures should be adopted in order to reduce Cornish residential bills.\n\n1) No second home or holiday home should be allowed metered water. They should all pay the average bill for the neighbourhood, plus a 20% \"clean sweep\" charge.\n\n2) All hotels, guest houses, B&B's, camp sites and other tourist venues, should be compulsorily metered, and they should pay the going rate, plus a 20% \"clean sweep\" charge.\n\n3) All public conveniences in and around Cornish beaches should be charged at \u00a31.00 a visit.\n\n4) There should be a \u00a31.00 levy on all organised coach trip seats into Cornwall.\n\nThis would bring in sufficient funds, I would hope, to reduce the astronomical charges the Cornish now face.",
