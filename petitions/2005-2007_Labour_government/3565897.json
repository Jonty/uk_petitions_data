            "background": "A charismatic screen presence, Sean Bean has proven equally effective as romantic leads and villains. Born and raised in Sheffield in the north of England, the lanky blond actor has retained his Yorkshire accent which has helped to set him apart from his contemporaries.\n\nHe is a proud supporter of Sheffield United and although a Hollywood Film Star he has not forgotten his roots in Sheffield and his beloved team.\n\nJoin with me in demanding he be given a Knighthood which he truly deserves.",
