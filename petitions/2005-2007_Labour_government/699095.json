            "background": "This refers to the trend in current policy making not any specific legislation. Public services and resources are not supposed to be only for those who can afford them.  It is facile to stop people from using or doing by attaching a direct cost, but this kind of policy is biased in favour of the wealthy and wealthier. Is it fair and does it make sense that a rich woman can produce more waste than a poor woman simply because she can afford to?",
