            "background": "Dear Mr Blair,\n\nWe brought animals to the TRNC just over 2 years ago.  They are our pets.  Things have not worked out for us here and we want to return to England.  However, our pets will have to go into quarantine for 6 months which is grossly unfair as if they were in the ROC they would be allowed straight home.  This is a small \u0130sland and \u0130 cannot see the difference in bringing animals from the North or the South into the UK. There seems to be one set of rules for one part of the \u0130sland and one set of rules for the other. There is no rabies on any part of this \u0130sland.  My pets do not even go outside of my house.  One of my persian cats is 17 years old and \u0130 dont think she would survive the quarantine for 6 months.\n\nPlease please please can you ask Defra to change this ridiculous ruling.  Thank you.",
