My friend in America has 24mb broadband, something we do not have in the U.K, for citizens.  People in Korea have unlimited broadband with speeds of up 100mb/s. \n\nWe need to bring the technology services in the UK forward, other wise will be products that we are unable to use products that we have brought.\n\nPlease consider my argument\n\nJames Bayliss.",
