        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Traffic policies are outdated, environmentally unfriendly and poorly considered.\n\nLight systems are introduced where roundabouts would better aid traffic flow. Traffic lights prevent traffic from moving, are costly, use electricity 24 hours a day and delay traffic when roads are clear.\n\nControlled pedestrian crossings are often inefficient with cars forced to stop when a pedestrian has pressed the button but found an opportunity to cross before the lights have changed. Pedestrians are tempted to look for earlier chances to cross and may take risks. Similarly pedestrians may assume traffic will stop because lights are in their favour. Zebra crossings encourage courtesy, are cheaper, efficient and generate a mutual respect. Onus is on drivers and pedestrians to consider each other. \n\nClosure of roads to traffic can double distance/time. Speeding in built up areas should be controlled by law enforcement not by turning roads into obstacle courses.",
