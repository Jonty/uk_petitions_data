            "background": "Why do so many refugees travel across several European countries before getting to the UK?  If they are fleeing for their lives (as most claim) then they should just be happy to get to a safe haven.  But no, some travel to southern Europe then come through several countries get on a boat in France and then claim asylum at Dover. It is my belief that all other EU states are safe places to live and anyone who leaves one of these safe places and then travels on to the UK should be sent straight back to the last country they were in without delay.  We should not judge their application on where they started their journey but what country they were last in before entering The UK.  The USA send Mexican's straight back as Mexico is a safe place to live.",
