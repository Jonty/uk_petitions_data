            "background": "The current modern apprenticeship scheme stands at 16-24 years of age. This means that training needs to be completed by the age of 24. As it takes so long to qualify in a trade for example: plumbers/carpenters could take up to 4 years to complete the training, because of this most apprenticeships are school leavers(16-19). Older adults (22+) who are keen and serious to learn a trade seem to be disregarded as they wont qualify before the 24 limit. Increasing this age restriction would mean that a wider range of people would be able to suceed in the modern apprenticeship scheme whilst gaining the support from employers and training boards.",
