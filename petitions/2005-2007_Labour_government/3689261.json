            "background": "Humberston Fitties is a Conservation Area Chalet Park near Cleethorpes Lincolnshire. The chalets are built on a plotland, possibly the oldest remaining plotland in the UK. For details see nelincs.gov.uk.\nThe local council are taking legal action against residents for breaking conditions of the tenancy lease. The lease states that the Chalets should not be occupied during Jan and Feb each year but they still collect ground rent, service charge and council tax for this period.\nA few people have decided to ignore this clause and have remained in their property this winter. The council are prosecuting these people. Its unfair but the councils only answer is \"its in the lease you have signed\"\nThis lease urgently needs to be reviewed. There are obvious fairness issues and probably human rights issues associated with this.",
