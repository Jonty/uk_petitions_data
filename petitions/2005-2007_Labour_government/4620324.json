        "background": "The Inland Revenue has made a massive mistake by paying more Child Tax Credit than is due to parents, overpaying by billions. However, rather than spreading the clawback over a period of time, they are simply stopping all payments until the overpayment is cleared. This will result in financial hardship for many families for whom Child Tax Credit is essential.",
