            "background": "At the moment students of Somali origin are unable to study Somali at GCSE level in our schools.\n\nWe believe that a really positive step towards helping promote better community cohesion among the Somali community in the United Kingdom would be to recognise Somali language as a GCSE subject in its own right, just as other community languages are - like Bengali.  \n\nWe believe that the result would be better understanding between generations, improved understanding of Somali culture in our schools and training and employment opportunities for a new generation of potential Somali teachers.  \n\nPlease sign this petition to lobby the DfES and other relevant government departments and bodies to recognise Somali as a GCSE and to take the necessary steps to introduce this in our classrooms.",
