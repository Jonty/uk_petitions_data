            "background": "I was pleased to see new legislation come into force on 6 April 2007 that makes it 'unlawful for a public authority exercising a function to do any act which constitutes discrimination.' \n\nIt was with some surprise (or not) that within the Equality Act 2006, the upper echelons of society hold an exemption, including the Judiciary, Parliament and the House of Lords.\n\nDraft Guidance has been made available by the Equal Opportunities Commission which also highlights that the above are exempted from not only discrimination, but harassment, including sexual harassment it seems. One can't help wondering if this is a covert attempt by the House of Lords to reinstate the practice of 'prima nocta' (oh the good old days).\n\nParliament and the judiciary should be subject to the laws that they respectively create and enforce.",
