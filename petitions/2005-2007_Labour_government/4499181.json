        "background": "Regular cyclists have become well acquainted with the many pot holes, cracks and subsidence especially along Devizes Road, indeed new holes seem to appear on a weekly basis.  The increasing numbers of heavy vehicles thundering along this particular road often keeping residents awake at night and the 30mph speed limit routinely being ignored surely needs to be addressed? We have been advised that experts have examined the road, well perhaps they haven't appreciated the full extent of safety concerns which surely should command the highest priority for repair and attention.",
