            "background": "Emails from some Registered Companies are near-illegible owing to the sheer amount of 'footer-trash' now being added to them.\n\nMany of these footers are being added in response to the Companies Act, which now requires comprehensive information about the sender to be included. Others are added on the basis that their presence will somehow protect the company from litigation. \n\nThe problem is exacerbated when such emails are forwarded, and thus acquire several lengthy footers. Such forwarded messages may literally become illegible. \n\nSince many users prefer to print emails, these compliance-footers, which may extend to one or more A4 sheets in size, are having a damaging effect on the environment. \n\nCommonsense dictates that if I am emailed by 'john@company.com' then I can find out all I need to know about that company by going to 'www.company.com' - In other words, provided a company website exists, the disclaimer is superfluous.  \n\nEven if it is felt that some form of compulsory 'footer' is needed on company emails (and I do not agree) then the rules could be changed to allow this to be a hyperlink to a webpage, which need be no more than one line.",
