Never using Bluetooth or hands free options.Ignoring the \"rights-of-way\" of other drivers whilst negotiating junctions and Rounbabouts with one hand.I've yet to see a single Police Check Point set up to stop this common practice. I've never read in my local papers of any prosecutions, so I can only conclude that the \"Police\" in general think this law is a total waste of their time to enforce!",
