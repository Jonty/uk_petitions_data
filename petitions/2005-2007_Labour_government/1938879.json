If I migrated to a non-English speaking country I would be expected to have a basic understanding of their language. Those wishing to make the UK their home have a duty to learn out language. It's not our responsibility to waste money on putting everything into multipul languages because they refuse to acknowledge our language. Any other country, it is priority to have a basic understanding of their language. I would expect anyone coming to make the UK their home to have a basic level of English skills as I would expect form a 3-year-old English child. It's time to make our language a priority for immigration & asylum! Speak our language or don't come here. Speak our language or get out and stop raping our benefits system!",
