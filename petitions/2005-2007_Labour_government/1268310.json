            "background": "The price of train fares are rising every 6 months, there is no difference in train journeys and the price of fuel is only going up by a few pence per year so what\u2019s the need for an increased rise of up to 40 pence per 6 months on a train journey that takes 20 minuets, and what offers do we get to help with the price, the best case scenario is a train card that can only be used after 9:30am, when it is plainly obvious that most people have to be at there place of work/education for 9:00am therefore this petition is to reduce the train fares or to make available a pass that can be used after 8:00am to get reduced prices.",
