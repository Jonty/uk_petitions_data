            "background": "Most 'jobseekers' are unemployed by choice; there is no such thing as unemployment, only an unwillingness to work - whether because its a 'dirty' or 'hard' job, or because its easier NOT to work. Many 'jobseekers' work cash in hand, as well as claiming, and therefore will not take an official job. Lets make them work for the communities for three or four days a week 9 till 5. Lets give them one day a week to jobseek. Any proper and decent 'jobseeker' would enjoy the work, knowing that they are helping the community where they live. Those that work 'cash in hand' would soon sign off or get a proper job. Aren't you sick and tired of paying your taxes so that these people can keep sponging off you? I am sure that everyone that reads this knows someone who is cheating the benefit state, and these people are cheating YOU. Benefits are meant to be there to help those that need help, the benefits system should NOT be a way of life.",
