This invaluable facility was used by 6500 in 2006, and more than 140 Qualifications gained. This disadvantaged area has seen many positive changes in its local community and is a lifeline to many local residents. Due to proposed cutbacks to regular funding, the fate of Mottingham Community and Learning shop isnt looking good. Please help!",
