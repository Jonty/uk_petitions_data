            "background": "I was very disappointed to hear that it is so difficult for those leaving the armed services to get social housing. It seems that it is particularly a problem for those servicemen and women with families who want to live in the area in which they have been stationed. The Housing Act 1996 states that a serviceman or woman should not be treated by the local authorities as being employed in their district. Nadine Dorries, the Conservative MP for Mid Bedfordshire, has taken up the cause and tabled a motion in Parliament asking other MPs to support it. Will you sign EDM 288? If not, I would appreciate if you could reply with your reasons why not. Yours",
