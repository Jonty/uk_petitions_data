            "background": "30000 men each year are diagnosed with prostate cancer. Out of every 100 cancers diagnosed in men, 23 are prostate cancers. Often prostate cancer has no symptoms.  Currently there are no regular checks available to men as there, rightly, are for breast and cervical cancer in women. Therefore 2 or 3 yearly blood tests would help to detect this killer in men aged 50 and above. I call upon the Prime Minister to introduce these tests immediately.",
