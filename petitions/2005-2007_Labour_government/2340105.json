            "background": "Police work hard in bringing offenders to justice. The investigations that are accepted by CPS and progress to court result in a sentence being awarded, however repeat offenders are serving in some cases a quarter of their sentence and are released to continue to commit crime.  This undermines the confidence in the Police and justice system, and does paint the picture that crime does pay.  The most effective way of reducing criminal behaviour is by removing the offenders liberty and thus their ability to continue to commit crime.  The public are sick of offenders being released early and not being punished properly.  The prisons may be full, therefore as the 4th or 5th richest country on this planet why can't we build more.  One thing above all else gives the public confidence, knowing that the offender that committed crime against them is in prison and serving a punishment that fits the crime.Lets tip the balance in favour of the victim instead of pandering to the offender/s.",
