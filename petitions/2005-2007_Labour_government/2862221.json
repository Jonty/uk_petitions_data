            "background": "A significant percentage of the working population who have had criminal records checks by the criminal records bureau, & employers who are exempt from the rehabilitation of offenders act 1972 are discriminated against from gaining employment. Careers are ruined for \"minor\" convictions e.g. Abh, even when they are spent: are 20 to 30+ years old or in ones youth. The government should change this policy of discloser of spent convictions to where only people who have spent time in prison or who are on a sex register i.e. considered a risk, are exempt from the act. Or, the government should promote in it's guidelines to employers that discretion should be shown to candidates if \"minor\" spent convictions are from a long time ago and did not warrant a custodial sentence or placing on a register! Allow people to turn their life around.",
