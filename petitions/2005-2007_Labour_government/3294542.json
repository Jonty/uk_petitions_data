            "background": "The chancellor introduced an amendment to Inheritance Tax rules in 2005/06 which effectively limited individuals ability to gift their home to their children during their lifetime  in order to remove its asset value from the IHT assessment on death.  Effectively the HMRC will charge Income tax on the rental value of the property if the parent continues to live in the home, even though the home is not let.\nThis is a tax too far and contravenes individuals right to live in the home without paying tax on something which is not charged or received by the new owner.  In effect, if you want to live in the home you have politiciand, sweated and worked for, but want your children to own it, you are taxed as if you rented it, but without the benefit of the new owners receiving rent.  It is an unfair tax and an unjust intrusion into private family life.",
