            "background": "In a bid to cut emissions by 60% by 2050, the draft Climate Change Bill proposes to set carbon reduction targets every five years. Mr Miliband has said annual targets would be too rigid to make allowances for climate variations.\n\nHowever, we set plenty of monthly and annual financial and other targets which are also subject to variations beyond our control, in particular the global economy. There seems to be no good reason why we can't also set annual targets for reducing carbon emissions.\n\nClear targets with regular review dates are critical to achieving any objective \u2013 especially one as ambitious as this.",
