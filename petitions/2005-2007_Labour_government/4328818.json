        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Time and again criminals and youngsters are given cautions, community service, or let off  but the victim always pays with destroyed goods and mental injury, The majority going to court know they will get away with it.   Change the law so that ALL persons convicted including youngsters who are caught causing criminal damage should have in addition to a fine or caution have their own property sized to be sold to pay the victim/court even if they have been purchased by the parents for the youngster should be seized and sold.  Criminal damage cases this should be mandatory. In this way if they commit crime, they will pay for it as they will lose their own personal items the only way to keep what they have is not to commit the crime.  This would help victims get decent compensation, it will send out a clear message to everyone, if you go out to cause trouble you WILL pay for it. The law is in too much toward the criminal change the law and MAKE criminals finally pay for their crimes",
