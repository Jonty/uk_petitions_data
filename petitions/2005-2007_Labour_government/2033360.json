        "background": "Presently psychotherapists in the UK undertake lengthy training specifically in psychotherapy.  In the US, psychotherapy has already been made elitist by being brought within the control of other professions, such as psychology, medicine and psychiatry: disciplines which are often confused with psychotherapy, but which view and treat clients and patients very differently.  \nIn order to retain the title \u2018psychotherapist\u2019, for example, government regulation may force practitioners to undertake further lengthy and unnecessary training in subjects which have little or no direct relevance to the practice of psychotherapy.\nPreserve the diversity of modalities, creativity and uniqueness of psychotherapies by preventing their misappropriation by other disciplines. \nDemand that psychotherapy be recognised and protected as an independent profession by signing this petition now.",
