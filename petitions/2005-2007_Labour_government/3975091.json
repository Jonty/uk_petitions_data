First of all, i feel that a word is not completely correct unless it includes a vowel. Therefore words such as \"By\" and \"My\" are, in my mind and many other people's mind, incorrect. Also words such as \"synopsis\" and \"xylophone\" use Y as the vowel so why not make it a vowel or as i like to put it: Y not?",
