Locking them up has clearly not worked as this teaches them nothing about core social values.  Many of these sociopaths claim they just want respect from their peers but they clearly do not understand the value of respect.  We need to deliver these bullies to justice by bringing them down a few pegs.  If its violence they respect then give them a taste of their own medicine. I propose we bring back Saturday morning marketplace public floggings in the UK and shame them into submission.",
