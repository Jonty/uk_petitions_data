            "background": "Encouraging more people to pay for their own private health care insurance reduces the load on the NHS - people should be encouraged to do so and as such, receive tax relief on their insurance premiums or direct payments for treatment. Its currently unfair that those who reduce their demand on the NHS have to pay tax on their alternative arrangements whilst still paying the full tax for their contribution to the NHS",
