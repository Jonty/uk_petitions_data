The government blames this on CO2 emission, however as you may also be aware, the Earth goes through a natural cycle of heating and cooling. The Earth cools and there begins an iceage, the Earth then heats up and then again cools down. The earth is simply going through a period of heating. The blaming of this heating on CO2 emisions are just a way of saving oil!",
