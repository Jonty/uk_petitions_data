            "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\n\nI have started this petition because i feel that todays housing is a shambles. I myself live in a victorian house. This house is built as part of a terrace with 3 bedrooms, 2 good sized gardens, good loft space, high ceilings and big rooms, separate toilet and bathrooms walk in hallway,  and is generaly of excellent build quality it has already stood the test of time by over 100 years.  Todays housing however is crammed into areas with other housing, build quality is terrable with a life expectency of 50 years at most. Everything about them is basicly the opposite of what I have described above. The rooms are small and pokey the gardens are horribly small, walls are made of chiprock and other cheap materials, are overpriced and last but not least a so called 5 or 6 bedroomed new build is likely to have less if not equal to floor space than my home. Its an utter disgrace so please can you introduce regulations to have a better standard of housing idealy similar to older housing with same build quality and if possible materials.  Thank you",
