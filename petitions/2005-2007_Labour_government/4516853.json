Then when you want to claim your extra money in the new tax year you can. This is decided by income status and how well you done.\nThis would help a lot of health issues and could be designed as to even save the government money due to the extra workforce and lower nhs health costs.\nIt would also encourage some parents to stop buying their kids junk food.\nOf course this idea would have to include an ethical standard of including local producers and retailers along side the big guys.",
