        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Severn Estuary has the 2nd highest tidal range in the world and can be exploited to produce about 7% of the electricity for England & Wales. A barrage passing near Steep and Flat Holm islands would help reduce global warming lowering CO2 emissions whilst reducing our dependency on foreign oil.Ecology, employment, water sports and tourism are expected to benefit.  The river side of the barrage would still be tidal but flood threats would be less and the water will clarify leading to better conditions for wildlife. A tidal power barrage at la Rance in France has been operating since 1966.",
