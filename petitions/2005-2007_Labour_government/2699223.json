        "background": "The US Embassy tops the chart for not paying the london congestion charge (on the grounds that it is a local tax).  There are millions of pounds owing by the US embassy and others.  Similarly these embassies owe parking fines and other charges which UK citizens have to pay.  This money represents a large proportion and it's morally unfair that Londoners have to pay whilst US citizens can drive in cars with diplomatic plates day or night and basically not pay our charges.",
