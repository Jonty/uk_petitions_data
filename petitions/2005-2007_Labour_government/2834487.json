            "background": "The world is not really a safer place than it was - Russia, China, the US, France - all major nuclear powers, all potential enemies.  It is absurd for the UK to continue to behave as if it is some kind of add on to US Forces, when the UK shares a position with the USA then it is appropriate to fight on the same side, it may be neccessary to take major action without US backing and of course at some point in the future the US and other major powers may be on the other side.  The UK needs it's own independent detterent seperate from any other national support; a navy, air force and army that are of adequate size, properly paid and properly equipped. As has happened in the past, development of new military technology will also in many cases yield civilian spin offs so it isn't a loss to the economy as some would have us believe - radar, rocketry and much submersible technology was originally developed for military purposes.",
