        "background": "Good democracy demands a separation of powers between the Executive, the Legislature and the Judiciary.\n\nMaking the PM directly elected will assist in achieving this aim.\n\nIt will also make what we are voting for at a General Election clearer in voters' minds: at present we vote for a mixture of MP, PM, party, policies and policy (although we are always told that we \"do not have single issue elections\" politicians are always quick to justify any policy by saying that we voted for \"it\"!).\n\nThe PM could still be made accountable to Parliament.  PMQs could still be retained.\n\nBest of all it would encourage MPs to be more independent of their Party when voting for/against policy.",
