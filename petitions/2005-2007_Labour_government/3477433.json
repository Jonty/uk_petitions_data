            "background": "All Independent Midwives have been informed that government is intending to make professional indemnity insurance (PII)a compulsory requirement for registration within 12-18 months.  There is no PII available to independent midwives. This means they will not be able to practice legally and women's maternity choices will be severely diminished. Independent midwives practice outside the NHS but within the regulatory framework of the Nursing and Midwifery Council and bound by it's Code of Professional Conduct and Midwives Rules.  Independent midwives are specialists in normal birth caring mostly for women planning home birth.  The care they give has been shown to have good outcomes including more normal births, reduced caesarean section rates and increased breast feeding rates. The government must ensure that PII is available to all midwives however they work or make independent midwives exempt.",
