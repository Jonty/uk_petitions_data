            "background": "It is a bad example to the youth of today for us to promote the use of Americanised spelling of words. Versions of words such as 'color', 'drive thru' and 'math' should not be used in this country, and more effort should be channelled into ensuring our children and those in education are taught the proper way to spell words, which will then go on to help them in later life.",
