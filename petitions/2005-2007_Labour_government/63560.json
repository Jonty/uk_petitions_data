This is blatant discrimination on the basis of age. This makes it possible for a British resident for over 30 years through patriality to still require to go through the process of naturalisation despite younger siblings who have never even been in Britain getting British nationality - well, pretty much automatically. The reason for this abbaration is not clear and discriminatory on the basis of age.",
