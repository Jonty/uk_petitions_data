            "background": "Space in the near future is going to be of great importance to this country technologically, militarily, and educational. This country needs to develop its own manned space flight program. Think of the educational developments that this would produce, think of the hi tech jobs this would produce, think of the inspiration to young children it would produce to see a union jack patch on a space suit, think of the pride to this nation. We should seriously indulge in manned space exploration for the future of the country. this would bring this country together enabling different ethnic groups to feel British and boost science and stir children's imaginations and give something for people to aspire to. This proposal covers so many areas from science, education, community,military etc etc .",
