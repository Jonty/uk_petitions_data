            "background": "With the rapid explosion in computing technology and myriad initiatives handed down from the Department for Education and Skills (DfES) for utilising ICT in the classroom, we believe that all teaching staff should be expected to attend a core computing skills course as part of their training to ensure they are capable of implementing these requirements successfully. \nAny such skills should also be regularly reviewed and expanded upon to keep up with advances in technology and the abilities of their pupils.\nCurrently teachers are expected to integrate ICT into all aspects of teaching and learning whilst many lack the basic skills required to do this appropriately, if at all. It is also apparent that students often have ICT skills over and above those leading their lessons. We believe that by increasing basic ICT skills levels teachers and students will both benefit in terms of better knowledge transfer, improved teaching experience and ultimately improved academic performance.",
