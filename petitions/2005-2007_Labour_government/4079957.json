            "background": "I, like many other people know people who are claiming this allowance. It is a good service but like all services people take advantage of it. I purpose that any person(s) claiming for more then 1 year should be cut off from the allowance, many people have been claiming for up to a number of years (I myself know someone who has been claiming for 6 years)and it seems to be unfair on the rest of the country if these people think that they can live off of tax money which everyday workers pay.",
