            "background": "The \"Equal Opportunities Commission\" employs 117 women and only 28 men.  This clearly highlights the \"penalty\" paid by men in this government funded organisation.  Furthermore, the \"EOC\" is responsible to Cabinet Minister Ruth Kelly, and Parliamentary Secretary for WOMEN and Equality, Meg Munn.  Predictably therefore, the commission's agenda has a very unfair bias towards women's issues, indirectly discriminating against men.  The humorous irony of the \"EOC\"'s staffing situation, in no way detracts from its unfairness.",
