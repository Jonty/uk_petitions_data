        "background": "As a full time worker I believe that I shouldn't have to pay for the mistakes of others. This seems to include teenage parents who cannot or will not support there own choices in life.\nIf these people are mature enough to get pregnant then surely they should be responsible enough to support the child throughout life. I am not predjudist and I do believe a fair system should be set up as some cases may qualify for state help. But I strongly oppose teenagers getting pregnant just so they gat an easy ride. Free council houses and state benefits for these people should be abolished.",
