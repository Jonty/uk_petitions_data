The enormity of the Disaster goes beyond even this.Hillsborough becomes a metaphor for British society today. It is a microcosm of how society operates. Viewed in this way the history of Hillsborough becomes the history of injustice, of cover-up, and collusion.\nHistory will record 'Hillsborough' firmly within the bounds of civil rights, and the bereaved and survivors of the Disaster will long be remembered for the heroic stances they took against the might of bureaucratic forces in the name of justice. Families, Fans need closure, and although these souls will never walk alone in the heart and soul of Liverpool FC, we NEED the TRUTH to be told, loud and clear, once and for all. YNWA",
