        "background": "Why should we in this country pay the above duties on imported British spares from abroad?\n\nAt one time, the vehicle left this country and taxes were claimed on the manufacturer for its export.\n\nNow, decades later in many cases, we have to pay additional tax yet again on something that has already paid for itself.\n\nI personally restore classic British motorcycles which could be classed as part of our lost automotive heritage and argue the taxes should be waived.\n\nThe same also goes for any second-hand spares from breakers yards, etc.",
