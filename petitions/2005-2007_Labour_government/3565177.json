        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Why is it that after 30 years of being told that global warming is threatening the existence of man-kind, it is only in the last 5 years and really only just recently that Governments (ours included) are just starting to take it serious?  Why in the last 30 years have the big Motor manafacturers not been made to produce cars that run on alternative fuel?  Why are we still burning oil to make our vehicles move?  There are many alternatives that can replace fossil fuels, but still everyday of every year these so-called ''modern'' cars roll off the production line still only equipped to burn oil.  I call on the Prime Minister to Offer incentives to the oil giants to research alternative fuels and the manafacturers to produce engines that use this fuel.  Offer consumers bigger incentives to buy green.  Lets rid our countryside of carbon from cars once and for all.",
