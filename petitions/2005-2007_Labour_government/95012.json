            "background": "The public are increasingly dissatisfied with the lack of sensible policing due to paperwork officers have to do preventing them being on the street. Police are blogging to expose failure in the system from political interference. Public and police are being let down by leaders with no idea what takes place on streets and in stations, wasted money and resources caused by politicians who might as well be on another planet. Let experts who do the job say how policing should be done not non-experts who have never been policemen. Politicians are making the police a laughing stock. Politicians, take this seriously, find true facts from public and police who have to give embarrassing excuses to why the service is so bad. Get at the sharp end for a week with patrols, let the public see you taking notice, listening to what really goes on.  Take time to read police blogs, if you are convinced then see if we can change this country for the better.  Start by signing the petition.",
