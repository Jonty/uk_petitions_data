Such brainwashing is cruel and reduces the ability of the child to think independently.\n\nThere are TV programmes promoting religion.  There is religious advertising on radio.  There are religious crazy people yelling in the street and trying to shove a leaflet in your hand.\n\nThis needs to stop.  People should be allowed to develop their beliefs out of their own free will.  Let them walk their own path and not one dictated by a dodgy old book that is drummed into your head as soon as you are old enough to talk.",
