            "background": "Mortgage Strategy has been campaigning long and hard for three years for the Stamp Duty threshold to change, and the magazine has received over 9,000 signatures (and rising) for its Step Up Stamp Duty petition.\n\nStamp Duty now stands at \u00a3125,000, double the \u00a360,000 it was previously.\n\nBut with more than one in five home buyers now over the higher Stamp Duty threshold, more needs to be done.\n\nAhead of the Budget on March 21, Mortgage Strategy now demands that the government increases Stamp Duty thresholds in line with the increase in house prices seen since the mid-1990s. On top of this, we want it to commit itself to index linking all Stamp Duty thresholds to house price inflation in the future.",
