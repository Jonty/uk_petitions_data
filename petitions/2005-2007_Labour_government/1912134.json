            "background": "Whilst many migrant workers bring benefits to the UK economy, many are exploited and used to undercut the wages and conditions of UK employees.\n\nThis petition calls for the government to consider taxation measures on any employers using migrant labour, so that the average regional wage for the work being undertaken is achieved, by addressing the difference between the average regional wage rate concerned and that paid to the migrant worker.  \nThis would also include a suitable fine and custodial sentence for any directors of said companies avoiding such taxation measures.\n\nAttempts to mitigate the measures would include other deterents, for instance,  using an employment agency to avoid the said pay rates would include the agency being banned from operating in the UK if based abroad, or losing its operating status in the UK. UK based agencies would likewise also face the penalty of a fine and custodial sentence for its directors for avoiding these tax measures.",
