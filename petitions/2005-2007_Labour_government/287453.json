        "background": "People should have the right to sunbathe, walk, play sport, shop,drive naked without fear of arrest. we were born without clothes and if people have the religious freedom to wear anything, surely we should have the freedom to ware nothing.This does not mean that people need to be nude only that they should have the right to choose.I believe that society has moved on and that society needs to move with it.I believe that the vast maority of people are no longer shocked or offeded by nudity and this should no longer be used in limiting what should be a basic human right i.e the right to be as one was born. If need be increase sentences for those who preform sex acts in public. Normalise nudity and these acts will decrease in any case please at the very least allow nude sunbathing in public areas such as all beaches and commons and other designated areas.",
