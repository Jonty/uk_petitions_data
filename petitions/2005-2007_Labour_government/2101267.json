            "background": "It is clear to all that postal voting is open to abuse from all parties, we hereby call upon the Prime Minister to ban all further use of the Postal Voting System and return faith to our electoral system. We oppose changing the tradition of going to a polling place to vote, we believe that requiring voters to go to polling places provides greater community, ensured secrecy, and importance to the voting process, while avoiding early voting. Concerns have been raised about the possibility of election fraud in vote-by-mail elections, varying from risks of multiple voting to the destruction of mailed ballots. Postal voting might increase the pressure of a dominant spouse to make their partner \"vote right\".",
