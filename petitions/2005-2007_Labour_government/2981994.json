This needs to include learning inter-personal skills that encourage communication and how to convey their needs with each other, and outside their social groups.\nThis can be taught in a right-brain context using drama, music, art etc to draw out what the students realy want for themselves, to move past the complaining but not communicating attitudes we pass on to our children.",
