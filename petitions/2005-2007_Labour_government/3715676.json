The probation service has its failings but it knows something about offender management - Big Business does not. Whom would you prefer to manage sex offenders in your neighbourhood - an expert or an accountant? Unlike the present probation service, private contractors will be completely unaccountable to the public. Even their contracts will be secret. Abolish NOMS instead - a total waste of public money.",
