            "background": "Currently giving to charity via GAYE exempts you from income tax on the donation, but you still have to pay national insurance on it, which penalises the generous. Making GAYE donations NI-exempt would encourage more people to use the system, resulting in less administration cost for both charities and Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs than the Gift Aid scheme entails and increasing the amount that charities actually receive, which will be reduced shortly due to the reduction in the main rate of income tax.",
