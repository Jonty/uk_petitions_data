            "background": "The level of calls to the ambulance service has doubled in 10 years, and with the pressures of government targets the service, and its staff, are at breaking point. \n\nmany calls to the ambulance service are inappropiate, and of these a large amount are people with minor injuries or ailments, who are under believe they will get seen immediately in A+E if you get taken in by ambulance. This not only has the effect of tying up the ambulance while attending to the caller, it also means that the ambulance crew are obliged to wait with the patient at A+E, thus causing the ambulance to be unavailable for anything up to and over an hour.\n\nSo please educate the public that everyone is triaged on arrival and seen in turn, and the method of arrival is disregarded. This could be acheived via public informations films, mail drops or maybe a mass text message campaign; and could help save the lives that are lost when there are no ambulances available due to frivilous calls for the wrong reasons.",
