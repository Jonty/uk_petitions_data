            "background": "As anyone who works in a town or city centre will know these places become very busy during lunch-hours.  This is not helped by the fact that old people pick this time of day to frequent the towns creating unnecessary people pollution.  Old people as we know need little sleep and therefore there is no reason why they should not be able to attend to their business before mid-day.  It is also hazardous for them to be amongst such hectic activity as their slow movements are likely to result in tripping and injury.  I would therefore like to see a complete ban of old people in towns and cities during these hours.",
