            "background": "In September 2006 the three battalions of the Royal Irish Regiment (Home Service)were stood down from active operational service after a period of 36years accumulated by themselves and their predecessors the Ulster Defence Regiment. In recognition of their service and sacrifice the regiment was presented by Her Majesty the Queen with the Conspicious Gallantry Cross. There has been to date no plans by the present government or the MOD to recognise the presentation of the CGC to the regiment by the issue of a post troubles medal/ribband or even clasp for serving and former members of the regiment to place on their Campaign Service Medals to celebrate the unique presentation of this gallantry award. This petition requests that this oversight by the government/MOD is corrected",
