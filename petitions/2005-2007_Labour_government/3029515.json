            "background": "It is proposed that council tax is frozen at current or reduced rates, and that councils are empowered to raise additional funds by local road pricing.\n\nBy progressively applying this policy, it is anticipated that road pricing may contribute about 50% of total local taxation.\n\nIn order to prevent abuse of this power, maximum rates per mile for various vehicle types should be issued by the government from time to time. Additionally, a regulator would be appointed to adjudicate unfair cases.",
