            "background": "My opinion on the governments intention to increase the powers of bailiffs to enter homes without a court warrant is a serious mistake. Bailiffs alreay abuse their powers. Thay can be arrogant, offensive, and intimidating particularly to vulnerable people such as disabled, aged, single parents. My suggestion is that their powers be curbed and to prevent them taking goods which are not the property of the debtor without the bailliffs themselves finding proof to the contrary.",
