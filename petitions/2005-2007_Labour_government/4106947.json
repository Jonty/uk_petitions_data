            "background": "Ok, so everyone knows all about Global Warming - that its happening NOW, that its caused by OUR co2 emissions and that the only way to save the planet is to stop them.\n\nI believe this to be one of the biggest mistakes, and that to believe that we can stop it is incredibly arrogant.\n\nGlobal Warming is a natural phenomenon - the Earth naturally warms up and cools down over thousands of years, and will continue to do so long after the human race is extinct. \n\nWhilst it is undeniable that we do contribute a lot of CO2 to the atmosphere - this amount is dwarfed by the amount that is emitted by volcanos and other natural phenomena - and for us to spend billions of pounds cutting down on CO2 production is like bailing out an aircraft carrier with a thimble. A waste of effort on its own.\n\nCO2 emissions into the atmosphere are natural in a balanced ecosystem - and are dealt with by 'mother nature' in the form of trees. If we kill all the trees then we upset the balance - and this is what has happened over the past few decades, leading to the current situation.\n\nPlease consider that our taxes might be better spent encouraging South American countries to stop deforestation, and plant more trees.",
