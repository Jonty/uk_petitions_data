        "background": "The Home Department (formally Home Office) Vehicle Crime Reduction Team (VCRT) has played a key role in the reduction of theft of vehicles and theft from vehicles.\n\nThe decision to wind down the VCRT is wrong. The VCRT acts as a focus and lead for front-line practitioners who are  implementing initiatives to deal with vehicle crime, at grass roots level. In particular dissolving the VCRT will seriously affect the development and implementation of a better regime to prevent the theft of both motorcycles and motorcycle parts.",
