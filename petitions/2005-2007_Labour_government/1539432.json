        "background": "Historically it appears that when a Prime Minister serves for more than two terms in office they become remote from reality and the people.  I offer Thatcher and Blair as examples.  This dislocation from reality leads to poor leadership and bad government.  One remedy would be to limit any Prime Minister to just two terms in office and therefore refreshing the countries leadership and presenting new choices to the electorate.",
