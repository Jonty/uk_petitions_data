I had a driver who attempted to make me go into the back of him yesterday and he was not a young driver but a middle aged man. I was also nearly hit by an idiot on a motorway sliproad the other day again not a driver but a middle aged woman. The only thing that needs to be tougher is the traffic laws and their enforcement",
