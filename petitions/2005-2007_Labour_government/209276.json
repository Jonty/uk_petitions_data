            "background": "The Government promised citizenship rights to retired Gurkhas following a major campaign in 2004, but hundreds of retired Gurkhas who should have the right to citizenship are having their applications unfairly held up by the Home Office.\n\nThe Gurkhas are also fighting the Government decision to only allow Gurkhas who retired after 1st July 1997 to become citizens - discriminating against hundreds of Gurkhas who served loyally but retired before this artificial cut-off date.\n\nGurkha campaigners are also calling for a fairer deal on pensions - Gurkha pensions are currently between 1/8th and 1/6th of the equivalent UK Service person.",
