I have tried for over 6 months to get my payments made to my ex-wife (through the CSA at their request), but I have not succeeded. I believe that the DWP should now be acting as the Child Maintenance Department, as they can automatically assess payments through the same means testing that is used for benefits, and the benefit investigators can find \"non-rsident parents\" who are dodging maintanence because they are \"on the dole\"",
