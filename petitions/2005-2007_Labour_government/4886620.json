        "background": "What cost a fortune, children loved it and it was helping  to teach them what we wanted them to learn?\n\nThe BBC Jam Interactive learning service.\n\nPaid for with BBC Licence Payers money, Its hard to believe its just been scrapped!\n\nChildren were already going through virtual worlds, speaking French with their friends and learning how the business world works.\n\nAt a time when there seems to be little investment for pupils with special education needs, BBC Jam was aimed at all ranges of ability and the entire 5 to 16 age group.\n\nThe project, which was approved by the Government and the European Commision, has cost \u00a3150m some of which was spent with independent production companies in the private sector.\n\nHowever because some commercial companies with alternative products feel that their interests will be hurt, the decision has been taken to hurt the interests of our young people who enjoyed and were learning from BBC Jam, and to put the Interactive system that has already had huge investment and great success back in the box. \n\nWe should neither waste this huge investment in the publics money nor our in childrens future!\n\nBBC Jam must be reinstated!",
