        "background": "Corporations should have to publicly release the figures relating to the amount of employees they have that have complained about bullying or harrasment, the amount that have been fired after raising a complaint, and the action the company took after complaints were raised.\n\nAt present, people can be bullied/harrased, then get fired after complaining, and get left on the scrap heap by the company. \n\nThe companies often claim they have a great working condition, when if the real facts were made public, it would be obvious that were not true.\n\nNames do not have to be printed, but each individual should be contacted to tell them they are included as part of the figures, so no-one is 'missed' and if a company does not accurately report the figures, a heavy fine should be imposed.\n\n\nName and shame the bullies.\n\nIts to late for me, but maybe it may make a difference for the next person.",
