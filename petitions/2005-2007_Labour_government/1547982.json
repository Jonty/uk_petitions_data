Looking at the recent McCartney case we can see a clear lack of fairness. \n\nIn either situations such as with or without children. Men should have equal rights to women. \n\nProcedures should also be in place in Court so that Judges do not differ when it comes to the ultimate decision made. Most cases are unique but usually there is a common theme with any case that could be proceduralised to prevent ambiguous Court rulings from one Judge to another.",
