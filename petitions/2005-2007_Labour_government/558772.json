            "background": "In one fell swoop the CDA has made it seem that Heathrow has moved next door to areas  miles away from the airport.There is no monitoring of noise from arriving aircraft and the  sound of planes in full throttle in early descent mode is akin to the noise level concorde used to make - but that was only twice a day.At every 90 seconds this is a breach of human rights!Now Gordon Brown in league with the aviation industry has stated that the imperative is more and more flights and runways and stopping runway alternation because the airlines insist this will deliver a huge boost to the economy.What about the right to a decent nights sleep for thousands of people previously unaffected by aircraft noise?",
