        "background": "By combining the role of both policy setter and adjudicator, central Government evades responsibility for the effects of its policy by refusing to discuss individual cases. Letters contain phrases such as \"I am unable to comment on individual planning matters due to the role of Secretary of State and the consequent need for impartiality\". This inability to discuss the effects of policy on individual cases leads to a lack of both local and central accountability - removing democracy rather than enhancing local accountability - as each level of Government blames the other for interpretation of policy without taking responsibility.",
