            "background": "We love football but feel very uncomfortable that a number of English premiership teams now have internet gambling firms as their main shirt sponsor. The sight of small children wearing football shirts which provide free  adverts for organisations who's only business is gambling is wrong. Our Children should be protected from this and not be constantly exposed to it courtesy of greedy football clubs. This Government should act now and prevent internet gambling companies from entering into shirt sponsorhip deals with football clubs",
