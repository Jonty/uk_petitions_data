Have to charge 17.5% VAT on a Hot Food Sale when the supermarkets sell hot food like chicken and ribs and other VATable items and dont charge the VAT rate. \n\nWe would like a fairer system to be put in place,and for this problem to be resolved as soon as possible. \n\nOur customers are being led to believe that supermarkets are cheaper because they are paying ZERO VAT on a luxury product.\n\nWith over 10,000 Fish & Chip shops and many thousands of other Hot food outlets this needs to be rectified.\n\nSign this pettition if you would like a farier system to be put in place, is it fair that there is one rule that some adhere to and others break.",
