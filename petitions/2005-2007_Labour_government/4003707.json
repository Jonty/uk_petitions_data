            "background": "We constantly hear of companies reporting profits well in excess of 1 Billion pounds, most of the time these are the companies that have been greatly condemned for over pricing eg banks and oil companies.\n\nI submit that there should be a massive increase in corporation tax for any company operating inside of the UK that posts a profit in excess of 1 Billion pounds a year.\n\nSuch a massive profit is totally beyond the realms of belief and will just sit in the bank increasing the banks and oils companies profits even further through interest.\n\nPerhaps then we can stop them awarding fat cat salaries to managers.\n\nStart taking the money from the people with money not the people without it.",
