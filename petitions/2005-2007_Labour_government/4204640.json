Some medical records may well be subjective ie opinion rather than fact and where patients are unhappy about parts of their medical histories being disclosed, they should have the right to have these elements withheld. After all, if the purpose is to enhance medical treatment for people, then surely it up to those people to decide which parts of their medical make up they want medical access to. [This petition assumes that computerisation is going ahead]",
