People would not greatly miss the 1p change:some either throw the 1p away or put it in a \"penny pot\". Why not use this very small amount to raise money for good causes such as Make Poverty History or Shelter for example. If business cant agree to this, lobby them to have \"99p campaign\" collection boxes at all tills. The charity collected for would rotate annually.",
