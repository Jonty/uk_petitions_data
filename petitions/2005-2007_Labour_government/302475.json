            "background": "Millions of chickens, ducks and pigs worldwide are kept in disgusting conditions in tiny enclosed spaces while alive so we can eat their meat and eggs when they are dead. These animals spend their whole lives in 'battery farms' being denied access to space, fresh air and even sunlight. They have nothing comfortable to sleep on and spend their time in dirty, cramped areas.\n  People are less aware that pigs are sometimes kept in 'battery' cages as well. These pigs are left to suffer when injured and any piglets they give birth to are denied access to their mother's milk or any basic warmth. They are left to die and in certain cases, loads of them are thrown into bins to rot. Adult pigs have the intelligence of a 3 year old, that might not seem like much to us but at that age, a human can feel just about all of their emotions and is very sensitive to pain.\n  Great Britain should lead the way in stopping these disgusting practises and saving these poor creatures from their misery.",
