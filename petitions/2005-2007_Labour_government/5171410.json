            "background": "GCSE english was the biggest waste of time. For two years we learnt nothing new and wasted valuable time i could have spent doing 2 other subjects i had to drop becuase english was compulsory. Given also that almost every english teacher i have ever had (in state and private sectors) has been terrible i question the need to make every student study english to GCSE when teaching standards are terrible anyway.\nOf course there is the argument that youngters language has deteriorated over the past few years but i would counter that my language skills have not improved during the two years i studied english as it was all spent \"analysing\" poetry the most pointless endevor i have ever come accross.",
