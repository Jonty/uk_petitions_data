During the 12 years that she has lived here, there is only 2 months where she did not have a visa and the Home Office are saying that because of that her 12 years are not continuous and re-started in 2003 when she didnt renew her visa in time...Read more!!!!! Very Important.",

        "background": "Anne moved to UK in 1995 with her family on her Dad's work permit.They lived as a family for 5yrs before she started uni at bristol on a student visa. This expired 31/12/06.She applied for residency on 28/12/06 and was refused last week on the grounds that in 2003 her visa had expired and she didnt renew it for 2 months! Anne was hard at work in 2003 juggling a very hard English degree and basically due to the pressures she didn\u2019t renew her visa in time by mistake.The Home office have not taken into consideration that she has done all her qualifications here from GCSE to Post Grad!She has been a trainee Lawyer since July 2006 and been offered a 2 year training contract which will see her qualified.Anne chose to stay in uk and make a life here,she has many friends here and her Dad has paid for all her education and maintenance costs with no student loans or grants!She pays all her uk taxes as well.How can the Home office throw this delightful and talented trainee lawyer out of the country that she has built her life in. Anne sounds english, looks english and wants to stay here where she belongs!",
