        "background": "Ban TV within the hours of 10 in the morning to 4 in the afternoon on ALL commerical and tax funded television channels on digital and terrestial tv. This will make children find the outdoors and when they get in at 3 they have an hour to play outside without missing blue peter etc. This will give most school children an hour to do their recomended exercise. It may seem harsh but day time telly - Nothing on! And a 4pm 'switch on' will allow for 1 or 2 kids programmes, then the other entertaiment begins.",
