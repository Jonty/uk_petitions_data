            "background": "I believe that this reduction will reduce the number of mature career changers to retrain as teachers and restrict people on training based on ability to pay rather than potential ability to teach. No consideration appears to have been given to retiring baby boomers or English still being a priority subject in the South-East. It appears to be an unfair change on specific groups of people to prevent them from becoming the great teachers and mentors that they could and should be due only to monetary reasons",
