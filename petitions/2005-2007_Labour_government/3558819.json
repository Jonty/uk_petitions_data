            "background": "I read a statistic that 1 in 4 people that go to their GP didn't need to, if this is the case charge these people a small fee to go to their GP. This will deter \"unsick\" people going to their GP for trivial matters and make it easier for actual unwell people to make an appointment. This petition is for all the people that have had an illness but have just left themselves to themselves as the hassle of arranging a GP appointment. Please name the petition 'Struggling to get a GP appointment??'",
