Surely this is is called parking control.  However there is no sense in clamping vehicles as this only causes more of an obstruction.   Once the owner pays the whacking fine for not only the PCN but also the clamp to be removed they then have to wait for up to 2hours for the attendant to arrive before they are able to move the vehicle.  It is silly and does not control parking!!",
