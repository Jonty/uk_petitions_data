        "background": "According to the BBC website, the number one cause of head trauma in children is Road Traffic Accidents, especially where the victim is a pedestrian or cyclist.\nMotorcyclists are already made to wear head protection by law. By extending this to cover all cyclists and pedestrians, we can further reduce the incidences of serious head trauma.\nBy mandating that the helmet should be worn at all times will also help to reduce head injuries caused around the home or at work (especially in high risk areas where safety wear should already be mandatory)\nWon't someone please think of the children?",
