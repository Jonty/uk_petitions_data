            "background": "I am one of a number of NHS workers who have been made redundant because my local hospital was knocked down and replaced with a new one privately financed.  The cost of this was drastic and the money could have been spent on renewing the inside of the old hospital,not letting it get run down for years.  The environment and atmosphere in the new building is awful and staff are unhappy.  Money was negigably wasted by the Trust and because they mismanaged their funds, my job role was sacrificed to make savings (or so they said!)",
