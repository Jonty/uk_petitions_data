            "background": "The family courts and marriage legislation have been corrupted by a cancerous Amazonian feminist dogma that sees traditional marriage only from a negative perspective.\n\nIt is interesting to note that in the most recent legislation concerning marriage -the term marriage is only mention in a negative context i.e. when speaking about domestic violence.\n\nThe only people benefiting from the current situation are the divorce lawyers  who care about nothing but how much money they can make by convincing usually the woman to start divorce  proceedings.The big losers are society and especially children .Fathers who want to play an active role in their children's lives are \nforced by this corrupt system to become absent fathers and the police are used and forced to act as a tool of liberal social re-engineering.\n\nThe family court and Cafcass have become Gestapo like institutions with unlimited power to destroy and rip families apart with the divorce lawyers as their greedy unethical partners",
