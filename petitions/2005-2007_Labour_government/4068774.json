            "background": "The threat of closing local post offices does more damage than just a business closure.  Post offices help the infirm and elderly who cannot travel long distances to obtain services such as special delivery or next day parcel/envelopes etc.  Everyone uses the post office in such a way that it is a meeting place where people talk to each other, they dont in shops, they also get a personal service, they que up for a shop till. The Paypoint system de humanises this traditional and history ridden function carried out by post offices. We ask that all post offices in villages, Towns and City's are kept and should be awarded special status to stop this most invaluable and special service disapearing from the UK altogether in the future, and the subsequent loss to the community of in some rural areas \"the life blood\" of the area. We call on everyone in parliment to support this or  eventually see this go extinct as the DoDo",
