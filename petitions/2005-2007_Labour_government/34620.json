            "background": "I believe that the introduction of conscription would benefit those who were conscripted by giving them self discipline, a sense of camraderie, motivation and incentive.\n\nI served for 25 years in the TA and was mobilised for Iraq. I do not believe that the volunteer professional army should be diluted with glue sniffing ASBO\u2019s but they should all be incorporated into individual conscripted units. This would involve keeping all the eggs in one basket and I believe that a high percentage would actually volunteer to join the regular army after their conscription came to an end.\n\nAny immigrant or religious sect who objected should be reminded that they are in UK and subject to it\u2019s laws. You cannot go to Saudi Arabia and dictate to them that as you lie drinking they should build a pub.",
