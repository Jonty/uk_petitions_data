            "background": "My idea for this petition is to increase the democracy of this country by giving every citizen a right to vote on every law being passed or idea created by Goverment. We at present only have the right to chose a political party and after the election the electorate leave it to the party chosen.I find that no single party in this country has a monopoly of good or bad ideas and think the time has come , as we have the technology now to have a system where our members of parliment can debate the issues but the country have a final say.This would take power away from powerful vested groups. As an example if we ever had to go to war again Parliment would have to ask the country.Another example is the country would have to be asked if members of Parliment needed a pay rise and what the increase should be.",
