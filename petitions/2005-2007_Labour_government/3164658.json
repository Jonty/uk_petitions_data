There isn't much point improving the houses without improving the environment.  What good is a 'Palace in the middle of a Pigsty'.  The existing budget is not high enough to implement the improvements needed, many of these areas have not been maintained for over 40 years.  (Radburn Estate, New Rossington, Doncaster).",
