            "background": "The River Severn Bridge tolls are now the highest in the UK. Why is it that this major road link between England and Wales is so expensive compared to other bridge tolls? Living in Wales has already become very expensive since 1997 due to the introduction of the Welsh Assembly, higher fuel costs, poor roads and virtually no public transport. \nThe Monmouthshire council tax is now more than three times greater than it was in 1997.",
