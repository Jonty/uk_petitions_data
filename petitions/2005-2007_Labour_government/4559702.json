            "background": "When the 15 sailors were returned the Britain, they were happy, smiling and showing off their gifts. To the press, they said that they had been treated well during their time in Iran. At that point, they were released and there couldn't be any pressure from Iran to make them say these things. Then, they were debriefed. Suddenly, they changed their stories and told how they were held in tiny cells, beaten, stripped and tortured with mock executions. At the same time, the articles on the BBC website quoting the sailors favourable first statements disappeared and the British media have not mentioned them since. This petition is to convince the government to remove any pressure it has placed on these sailors and the media and allow them to tell the truth.",
