            "background": "In rural areas, home ownership is out of the reach of many local people due to the scale of holiday and second-home ownership. \n\nIn urban areas, home ownership is out of the reach of many local people due to the scale of property speculation driven by buy-to-let purchasers, low interest rates, and lax lending policies by banks and building societies.\n\nThe government should act to rebalance the housing market (via taxation and stricter banking regulation if necessary) to establish an environment where residents of rural areas and key workers in urban areas can find affordable housing, and where house price growth is lower but more sustainable.",
