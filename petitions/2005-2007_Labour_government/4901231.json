            "background": "I believe that police officers should have a minimum pay rise equivalent to inflation. It is my concern that the government via the actions of the Home Secretary will offer police officers a pay rise less than inflation, thus effectively cutting the relative pay of police officers. Police officers on a daily basis risk their lives in carrying out their day to day duties. This was highlighted today with the tragic death of a young police officer in Shrewsbury. As the wife, sister and sister in law of serving police officers and the daughter and niece of retired officers I feel passionately that these brave men and women should be paid a salary that reflects the risks that they confront.",
