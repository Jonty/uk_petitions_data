        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "IHT debate boils down into 2 main areas. Individuals get frustrated perceiving a major % of savings go not to securing descendant\u2019s futures, but to fund much that is... wasteful. To Govt IHT is an historical plum too good to be denied, justified by wealth being redistributed \u2018for the common good\u2019. Climate change is accepted by a majority as the most serious issue we face. Carbon Legacy is a fruitful compromise between entrenched positions, which remain deadlocked. A no middleman bequest, down to the IHT limit, donated to any initiative that is proven to be tangibly DOING something to improve matters on a measurable e-ROI, free from all but the most crucial instruments of management/oversight. No \u2018redirection\u2019! Funds straight to where most needed, to do the most good for the future. Some devils in the detail, but doable with consensus. In so doing it must surely satisfy both the needs and aspirations of all sides.",
