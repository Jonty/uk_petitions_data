        "background": "All this talk of 'equality' and 'unity' coming from the politicians and yet we English are constantly being discriminated against. We have to pay Scotland subsidies for them to recieve better public services. There is no equality especially when Scottish/Welsh MPs are unfairly getting a say on the running of our country. I demand the 'Union' is disbanded and England made independent.",
