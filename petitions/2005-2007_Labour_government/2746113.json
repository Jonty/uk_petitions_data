In this way those with less economical vehicles or those who did greater mileage would pay accordingly. This would be a 'fair' system and a 'pay as you drive' scheme where people could easily keep a track on what they were being charged. NO EXPENSIVE GPRS SYSTEMS IN OUR CARS TRACKING OUR EVERY MOVE.\n\nI urge the Great British  public to sign this petition.",
