            "background": "I have noticed the lack of decent skateparks in the uk.I have visited many which were not up to scratch, which have only very limited facilities. The skateparks in the USA are incredibly superior to our own,the worst skateparks there are better than the best here. Skate boarders, and the skating community, are \"moved on\" whilst skating in the street by community support officers. Then why aren't skateboarders classed as part of the community? The answer is simple, the goverment cannot be bothered to do anything about it. The answer is to not move them on, but provide the necessery facilities to stop them from being an annoyance.\nPlease sign this petition.\nThank you.",
