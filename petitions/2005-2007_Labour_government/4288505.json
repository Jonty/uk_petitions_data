The female members of the sixth form however, are allowed to wear shorts, crop trousers and mini skirts. Although feamles, we feel this is discrimination against the boys at our school. It is a violation of human rights. We want equality between the sexes and feel that direct communication should be made to our headmaster as he has refused acknowledgment of student protest.",
