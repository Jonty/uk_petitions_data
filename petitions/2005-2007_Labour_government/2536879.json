            "background": "Few comics have reached their 10th anniversary, let alone their 30th.  2000AD, and its flagship character Judge Dredd, are just about to pass this milestone.  The last mainstream British comic still in circulation, 2000AD has nurtured great British writing and artistic talents now in huge demand worldwide.\n\nWe believe that a good way to recognise this achievement would be to reward the founding editor, Pat Mills, and the comic's other two mainstay writers, John Wagner and Alan Grant, by making them knights of the realm.",
