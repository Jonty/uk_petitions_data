            "background": "Imagine England as the first country in the world without smoking. \n\nWe all know it would benefit everyone, the NHS in the short term and in particular the children of today plus future generations. \n\nPut simply, we request a set a date in the future 5 years from now at which point smoking will be banned and the import of tobacco ended. \n\nEveryone would then have 5 years to give up smoking, those that cannot give up by the ban date would need to obtain cigarettes on prescription after that point and smoke them at home.\n\n5 years to make our country smoke free.. we should be the first country in the world to achieve this and start today. Please sign this petition and put your and your childrens future first.",
