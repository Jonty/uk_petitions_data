            "background": "The recent attempt to highlight issues of child abuse in Eastenders (with regards to Stella and Ben) is getting somewhat distressing. I know they are just trying to highlight issues and tug at peoples emotions as this is what usually makes for good programming. However We feel that this issue is going too far and that there is no need for it to go any further. Also the fact that this woman is getting away with it is not what we need to see happening. We can also see this story ending tragically and what would that be saying to children out there that may be suffering the same type of abusive behaviour. As this is not late night programming and I'm sure kids of all ages are still wide awake at 8pm, join me in my protest to get this plot stopped and sign up.",
