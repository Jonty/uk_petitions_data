            "background": "While it may be true that youth crime on buses has increased by over 50%, this is due to a small minority of inconsiderate people who do not deserve free bus travel, and the problem of which can be solved by revoking the privilege of free bus travel from those found to be abusing it. Even after this 55% increase, only one in 250,000 bus journeys leads to a crime report. The increased prevalence of CCTV cameras on every bus and 1,200 Police Community Support Officers on buses is beginning to combat bus crime, but should be given a chance. Free bus travel is a privilege, not a right, for under-16's, and should be treated as such.",
