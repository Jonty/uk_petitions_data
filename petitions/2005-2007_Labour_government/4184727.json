            "background": "London is a big city and welcomes tourists and travellers alike, but coach drivers are faced with a daily task of not being able to stop in London. There are always Double Yellow Lines, Double red lines and now cameras watching you. If we stop a ticket is issued. THIS DOES NOT HAPPEN TO LIMO and  TAXI DRIVERS. They park in coach bays and do not pay the high charges that face coach drivers. ie \u00a31 for 10 mins. If we stop in a Cab Rank, Cabbies are on the phone complaining immediatly. Coach parks charge \u00a310 per hour, and often not near an attraction. We are also restricted to driving hours and driving around limits us. We have to fork out this and often wait for up a week before we can claim it back. (\u00a310 per hour x 4hours  x 7 days = \u00a3280 possibly a week)\nWe can not stop on BUS STOPS even though the road tax we pay, classes us as BUSES.\nLondon earns plenty from tourists.",
