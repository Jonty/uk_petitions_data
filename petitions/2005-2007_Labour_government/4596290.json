            "background": "The present jump of ten miles per hour in speed restrictions is too great.  We have only 20 mph, 30 mph, 40 mph, etc.  Where kph limits are applied, 10 kph corresponds (broadly) to 5 mph, giving much better control of sensible speed limit setting.\n\nA 25 mph speed limit might well be sensible where a 20 mph limit is too restrictive, for instance on new housing estates.",
