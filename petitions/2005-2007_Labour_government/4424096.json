There is a growing number of angry views on their own Points of Views Messageboard with at lease 1000 messages asking for this.  However in the last few hours the BBC has close the first two threads for no given reasons. There are also other messageboards opening in the internet with at lease 90% of messages calling on the BBC to do so. Many of the people have email the bosses of the BBC who reply with a standard email back.  Seing as we the taxpayers paid for the BBC is it not wrong that the BBC takes no accounts its viewers.",
