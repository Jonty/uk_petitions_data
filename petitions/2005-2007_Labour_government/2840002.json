Vast sums of money are waisted trying to solve the problem and it seems we blame everyone but the children and their parents/guardians.  I feel the government should get tough with the parents/guardians of these children and make them take responsibility for their actions, on the spot fines given by the schools or stopping/reducing benefits are possible solutions.",
