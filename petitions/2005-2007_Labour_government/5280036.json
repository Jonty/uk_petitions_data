For example, hotel owners are not permitted to restrict the sharing of beds by same sex couples, members of clubs are likely to be forced to accept membership applications from people or groups of people they do not wish to become members.\n\nWhilst the undersigned do not believe in discrimination and do not condone harassment of individuals for any reason we believe that the right of the individual to choose who they spend their time with in privately owned premises or premises defined as members only be a matter for choice for the owners of such property.",
