            "background": "The Ramblers Association are always campaigning to increase access on private land. It is about time they paid towards the up keep of these paths. Many landowners have to pay to keep the paths in decent condition and this includes picking up litter and repairing damage caused by the walkers. All this along with the threat of legal action should an accident occur on the land makes landowners less likely to allow access, either legally or otherwise.",
