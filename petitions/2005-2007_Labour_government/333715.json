            "background": "As an incentive to entrepreneurs, corporation tax was set at 0% for the first \u00a310,000 of profit for a number of years.  This relief was recently removed, in part we understand due to abuses of the system, where individuals would create multiple companies for the purposes of evading tax.  The removal of this relief has had / will have a negative impact on genuine small businesses, who are creating employment and revenue for the UK, while individuals who intend to evade their tax responsibilities will merely move on to something else.  We urge the Prime Minister to reinstate this relief and make suitable stiff penalties for those who abuse it.",
