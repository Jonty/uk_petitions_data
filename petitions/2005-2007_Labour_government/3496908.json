        "background": "Many like me have been given Hepatitus C in infected NHS blood transfusions pre 1988,and through unfair criteria legislation in the ex gratia payments scheme issue by the DOH  Skipton Fund are now denied any compensation whatsoever by the Govt for being \"natural clearers\"and clearing the disease in its acute phase.\nThis is grossly unfair.\nWe were all given the same disease.\nOver 1,000 people have already died from this disease.\nMany like me have suffered enough socially,financially and emotionally already. \nWe urge the Govt to acknowledge us and do the decent thing and award us our rightful compensation,even if it is a lower ammount to the others, as the Govt has a moral and financial obligation to us all in this issue.",
