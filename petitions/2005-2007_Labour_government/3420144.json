We should never do anything to an animal that you wouldn't do to a human (ie. would you lock a human in a cage in a lab and test on him/her until he/she dies? Didn't think so). They have never done anything to us, we should treat them with respect. Anything that abuses/kills/exploits animals in ANY way should be banned immediately. This includes hunting, vivisection, battery farming and real fur. They are our friends, but we are certainly not being very nice back at the moment.",
