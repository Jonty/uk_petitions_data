            "background": "The February 2007 IPCC report established human agency as the chief cause of global warming, and set out the scale of the threat facing humanity in the rest of this century. No one solution will address it, but the unrestricted use of the private car is incompatible with any serious attempt to reduce CO2 emissions, and our country will be incapable of exercising any form of leadership in this domain if it allows emissions to increase. If you love your children more than you love your car, you should sign this petition.",
