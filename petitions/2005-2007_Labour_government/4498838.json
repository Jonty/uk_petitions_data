        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The four wheel drive excise duty is to be increased dramatically this will effect the people that need these vehicles on a day to day basis. For example farmers who require four wheel drives and would not be able to operate effectively if they did not have them, they are already struggling why make them struggle more. There are also people in rural areas that needs these as part of their business, there are charities and animal rescue people that need them to transport animals, pick up feed etc. Why penalise everyone when it should be based on people that are using them for school runs in urban areas as a status symbol.",
