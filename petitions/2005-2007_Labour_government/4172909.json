        "background": "Affordability is one of the most abused words in the English language. It usually means not quite as extortionate as the house next door.  In Cumbria wage levels are low, especially amongst first time buyers who are almost by definition starting out in their working lives.  Developers are calling properties affordable when they are \u00a3140,000.  They should be required to refer to a Local Housing Affordability Index when determining what is affordable.  Housing provision cannot be left to the free market. It is too important.",
