            "background": "Community first responders are volunteers who give up their time and money to assist the ambulance crew by early access to patients. The problem is that we are currently not allowed to use a emergency warning system i.e. blue light and siren on our vehicles. This can hold us back in busy traffic situations. Also due to the centralization of the ambulance services the nearest available ambulance could be 15-20 minutes away. This then defeats the early access and resus policy. I feel a warning system on vehicles can save time and lives.",
