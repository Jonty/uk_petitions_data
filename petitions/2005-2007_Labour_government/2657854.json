            "background": "How is this country ever going to move forward if young, hard working, law abiding people cannot have their own property large enough to raise a family? It's everyone's right to start a family but with the lack of care for young people and the financial burden of x5 salary mortgages there is no security or standard of living. New (realistically affordable) houses need to be made, fit for hard working, law abiding young people and exempt from property developers and previous homeowners.",
