My case was last reviewed in 1999, the payments are a waste of time, circumstances have changed and they don't want to know.\nIf the CSA is scrapped, we will never see the money owed again.\nI think someone from Government should intervene and make the CSA sort this backlog of cases out under the 'old rules', before it's too late... and backdate payments! Under the 'new rules' I should be receiving three times what I am getting. It's not fair!",
