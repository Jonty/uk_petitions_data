            "background": "From the initial claim contact to the  receiving of JSA, income support or incapacity benefit the period can be in excess of 10 weeks, why?. Crisis loans are inadequate, and a demeaning experience. The only method of contact is via telephone and takes up to 1 hour to answer, hearing it ringing constantly with the \"sorry for the delay\" message repeated all the time.\nAny requests via the jobcentre are answered by refering you to the phones.\nThese long delays \"due to staff shortages\" or \"heavy workloads\" result in severe financial strain to applicants also resulting in additional charges from banks as direct debits  etc are not paid on time,who are then advised to \"borrow\" money from friends & family members to tide them over until their claim is processed.\nThe delays are unreasonable and unacceptable in this day and age,moreso when after suppling all original documents they proceed to lose them. Furthermore why do we need 4 security guards standing around by the reception/claims desk ?.",
