            "background": "Where a second home is purchased, that 1% of the purchase price of the  property is paid as a tax to the local authority, for the purpose of building affordable homes for families with\na local connection to that area \n\nIn North Devon we have a huge problem with young people being prced out of the housing market because of low wages\nand high housing costs.  Further, as an attractive area to live, many people choose to buy a second home.  This reduces rented stock and forces house prices up.  As a consequence many houses are empty for many months of the year whilst local people struggle to pay high rents because they cannot afford  to buy.  There is insufficient social housing and so this is not an option either.  North Devon has  4000 people on the housing waiting list and only 200 properties became available last year.  A small tax might make a  huge difference .  North Devon is not unique and a national policy would perhaps alleviate the problem in many other areas also.",
