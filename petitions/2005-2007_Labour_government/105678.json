            "background": "Dear Mr. Blair, Atlantic whale species are not endangered, so please repeal the international treaty on whaling that criminalises whaling, and to abolish the bill that criminalises cod-fishing. It's not evil to kill an animal so that you can eat it. Please repeal that treaty so that we reduce the amount of food we import from overseas. You will also reduce unemployment this way.\n\nThe \"whales are dying\" lie has been repeated by pseudoecologists for decades, despite being presented with overwhelming evidence to the contrary.",
