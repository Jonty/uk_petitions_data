            "background": "People on P.A.Y.E. can't avoid paying taxes so why should the rich, who can afford accountants to tell them about the exisiting loopholes, be able to?  It is the duty of EVERYONE on an income higher than the various tax allowances to contribute to the cost of public services; if these loopholes were abolished more could be spent on services which benefit people who CAN'T afford accountants.  \nI would also suggest that there should be far more than just two tax rates: there should be four or five from 5% for the very lowest-paid to about 80% for sports, pop, etc stars paid weekly amounts most people can't even dream of earning in a year.",
