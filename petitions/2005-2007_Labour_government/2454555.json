            "background": "The Daily Mail of 13 Feb 07 states that Transport Minister Tavish Scott is hell bent on bringing the road poll tax north of the border and wanting to impliment this abhorant tax a.s.a.p.  He states that the Blair government lacks the courage to impliment same and that the Executive should go ahead with this 'stealth' tax.\nI say no way.  The motorists north of the border already pay higher fuel charges than south of the border and just think what this will do to the economy of the Highlands and Islands.  The tourism will face a downwards spiral and see the Highlands and Islands face economic ruin.\nTavish Scott needs to apologise to the electorate, especially as he is ready and willing to impose the death sentence on the Scottish people.\nThe First Minister needs to bury this totally ill thought through 'tax collection' before the May election and I request him to do so immediately.\nMaureen Reidy (Senior Citizen)",
