            "background": "As a compromise to Local Councils who have or are implementing fortnightly refuse collection, bin bags should be provided free of charge to enable refuse to be double bagged in accordance with Council guidelines. Secondly, recyclable refuse should be collected weekly to encourage people to recycle and show the commitment to recycling from the Councils, which they expect from their taxpayers and to minimise hygiene hazards from over crowded and dirty bins.",
