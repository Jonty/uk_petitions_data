We are outraged that our identity as residents of South Bedfordshire is being taken from us without any consultation, and ask the Prime Minister to reverse the proposal for Luton Borough Council to make decisions regarding South Bedfordshire towns and villages. Luton is a separate unitary authority and it should be kept that way. Let South Beds keep its identity - we don't want to be a part of Luton!",
