Mr Blair & his cronies are intent on closing it down, trying to lie to us all that it's for the best?  Why fix something thats not broke? Why should the hospital staff/patients/people in the community suffer because Mr Blair has run this country into the ground & are incompetant?  PLEASE stop these idiots plans & stand up for the RSCH, which has served us all brilliantly over many years & show your support by signing every petition & stop these silver spoon idiots who have no real clue about what it is to be a normal person living in this fast decaying country. How can they possibly have any understanding of living in the real world, because their lives are a far cry from normal people? These spoilt, rich brats who've had it all on a plate and no nothing of reality. If we stopped letting people flood into England we'd have enough NHS/Housing/Benefits for everyone whos worked for it, instead of being sucked dry by spongers fleecing us, we all know that,why doesn't Mr Blair? Thanks to them this country is screwed!",
