They are deadly serious, can not make light of anything and make life a misery for the rest of us.  They cannot be allowed to inflict their warped values for any longer.\n\nIf this problem can not be solved medically there is only one solution; banish them to Mars.   I believe there may be space there.\n\nThis issue requires the government's immediate attention as it is the pressing issue of our times and failure to act could lead to civil unrest and economic collapse.",
