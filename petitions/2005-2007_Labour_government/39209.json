            "background": "We also concur that since the deregulation of the railways in the 1990s prices have risen steeply on rail public transport - for many in some areas, such as young people, it is not always feasible to travel due to the expense. Train Operating Companies are not always meeting their targets and the dismantling of the railways into seperate companies has created a situation that when things go wrong one company can blame another for things that go wrong e.g. accidents. As a broken up entity the railways are not being regenerated at the speed that is neccessary to enhance them to a reasonable standard and make them affordable, that would encourage people out of their cars and onto the trains.",
