            "background": "In the past psychiatric assessments were carried out by psychiatrists in magistrates courts and this resulted in a number of \"criminals\" being detained in specialist hospitals rather than prisons - consequently a greater number of people were getting the correct help and treatment that they required. Due to budget cuts, this is no longer the case and the continued overcrowding of our prisons is testament to the fact that the way the system is currently operating is both unacceptable and unworkable. This needs to be rectified as soon as possible and many prisoners are not getting the adequate care and attention that they require - sort it out now!",
