        "background": "Police should be able to stop and fine / arrest cyclists who ride without due care and attention and disobey all traffic regulations that other road users have to abide by.\n\nCyclists somehow feel that red traffic lights do not apply to them or that it is acceptable to swing up the pavement and use the pedestrian crossing to avoid traffic lights.\n\nThis situation has to be stopped. Cyclists should be forced to stop at the red lights and not cross through either ignoring the light totally, or passing over the pedestrian crossing and stopping the other side of the crossing in the middle of a junction.\n\nCyclists regularly endanger pedestrians and other road users, and the blame for accidents they cause is always aportioned to the other parties involved.\n\nCyclists must be treated the same as other road users and the same laws enforced on these dangeroud road users",
