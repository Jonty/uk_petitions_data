The government do nothing about it except sit back and coin the money in! Im fed up with it, its taken me 30 mins this morning to travel 4 miles in West Sussex as road works on two major routes are down! Its an outrage! Why when we pay so much to the up-keep of the roads are we delayed beyond the acceptable? I would like the government to employ the Top Gear team and ideas in to repairing all the useless roads in Britain.",
