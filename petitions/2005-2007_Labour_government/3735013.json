            "background": "A short while ago the Chancellor Gordon Brown was interviewed on television, stating that all pensionors would recieve the \u00a3200 heating allowance, All Pensioners, for those pensioners who left  Briton before the heating allowance was introduced and reside in the EEC., they do NOT get the heating allowance, many are on low incomes and often sick and feel the cold as much as anyone else . many have worked and contributed to the British tax system throughout their working lives ,also many were not of pensionable age when the payment came into effect, they have as much right as any other British person . If Gordon Brown says all pensioners then he should stand by what he says and pay all pensioners not leave many elderly people out in the cold. BE precise Gordon and tell the truth .say what you mean . Please help cold grannies by signing this petition",
