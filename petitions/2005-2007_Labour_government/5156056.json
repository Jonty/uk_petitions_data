            "background": "The old system was good. If you had been a tenant for many years, you got a good 65% discount. Now i know that this was amended as too many people where buying their homes then selling them to make huge profits, and why the \u00a316000 limit was introduced. However, i propose that the original right to buy scheme is re-introduced, but with stricter controls on the sale of the property, maybe extending the 3 years to a more realistic 10 years. Selling before then, you will have to pay the discount back. This however, would not apply if the property is signed over to a nominated spouse/sibling, but the same terms of not selling the property would apply.",
