            "background": "'The Great Global Warming Swindle' was recently shown on Channel 4 on Thursday March 8th, and aired once again on channel 4More last night (Monday March 12th).\nIt very eloquently argued that Man is not to blame for increases of CO2 nor can CO2 be the cause of global warming.\nI watched this programme last night with an open mind and by the end of it was fully convinced of the sheer folly of spending millions on a very current myth. This has now become such a hot political potato that no one dares to challenge obvious scientific errors in the rush to push their own green agenda. \nI advise everyone to Google 'the great global warming swindle' and to read all about it. After that I fail to see how anyone wouldn't vote for this petition. Do it now before you are hit with untold new & dubious taxes, which will have nothing to do with being 'green' but rather more to revenue gathering.",
