            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The MOD occupies thousands of acres in National Parks for weapon training & sales by manufacturers. This denies access to thousands of people enjoying some of the most spectacular scenery in the UK. The Parks were set up for people to enjoy, not for the MOD to rent out for weapon testing.\nExample:- Manorbier, West Wales, in the Pembrokeshire Coast National Park.  The coastal footpath is broken by MOD activities in many places, in particular, Air Defence Range Manorbier where missiles are tested, hitting Mach 4 & blasting out noise levels heard 20 miles away. Thales, a French company test and sell their missiles here. It is time the MOD scaled down activities in the parks, and time for the government to stop manufacturers using our Parks as sales pitches and testing grounds. Everyone agrees troops have to be trained. There are many sites here and abroad that can be used without impacting on local communities and the environment of our National Heritage.\nPlease sign",
