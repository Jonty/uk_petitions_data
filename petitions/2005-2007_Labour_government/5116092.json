            "background": "The EU bureaucrats are proposing to introduce a regulation that requires every breeder of captive bred birds to close ring their chicks.\nwhilst close ringing is feasible for many species with some species such as the smaller wax bills and finches it is not a practical proposition owing to the high risk of parent birds abandoning their nests due to  interference / nest disturbance.\nif compulsory close ringing of captive bred birds becomes law then many species will be lost in aviculture for ever.",
