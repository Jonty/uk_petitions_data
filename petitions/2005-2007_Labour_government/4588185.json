            "background": "No ball games signs (which are erected by local councils) are not currently legally enforcable. This leads to the rules being regularly flouted by people who create a noise nuisance by repeatedly kicking their footballs against neighbours fences and causing trouble in the neighbourhood. If they are made legally enforcable then police would be able to warn youngsters not to do this and possibly (using asbo's) prosecute people who flout the law.",
