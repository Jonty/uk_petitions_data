            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As has been constantly reported in the media, Smoking and Alcohol are now being considered as far more hazardous drugs than before.\nIn the news today, alcohol was rated very close to heroin on the scale of dangerous drugs, higher than Ecstacy, Cannabis, and so called Dance/Party drugs.\nMost drinkers and smokers start at a young age, therefore by raising the age to 21 we take the most susceptible out of the equation.\n Violence by teenagers and young adults due to consumption of excess alcohol, binge drinking and an inability to handle small quantities of alcohol would be cut. It worked in America so why not in the U.K.? \nIt also means that yougsters will not be able to obtain supplies of Alcohol and tobacco so readily,therefore not starting the smoking habit or binge drinking so early in the first place.Drink related crime would be cut, and a night out in the \"local\" would be safer and more enjoyable for everyone concerned.\nPenalties for those supplying under age drinkers or smokers should be made much more severe to deter any retailer from risking prosecution.",
