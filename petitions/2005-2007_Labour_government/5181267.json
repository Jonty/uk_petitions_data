        "background": "People in rural areas more so those on low incomes are stugling with the cost of transport, many do not have access to public transport and those that do find the cost inhibitive, many need to have a car in order to do simple things like shopping as most small villages now have no shop and it is not uncommon to have to travel a number of miles to shop for  basic needs, in these areas access to transport of one form or another is essential. We urge the Government to look at this problem and consider some form of discount with the high cost of travel.",
