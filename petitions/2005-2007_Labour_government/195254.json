Shall we bring back witchcraft trials too??? Ban Hunting in ANY form. The hunters are making the law look foolish we need STRONG enforcement to show them they do NOT own the countryside despite what they think. PROPER ENFORCEMENT OF THE LAW, you cannot choose which laws to obey and which you disregard. Typical upper class arrogance.",
