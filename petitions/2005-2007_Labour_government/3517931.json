But a also there are some of people who have a personal water craft do not obey even the minimal of rules like water speed and cause accidents by reckless driving and are a danger to themselves as well as other water users especially in the coastal waters. They also cost the RNLI many thousands of pounds every year to rescue all involved. Make people take courses, have certificates or licences as well as insurance and carry them at all times as if they were on a road in a car. It is often more dangerous to have an accident in the sea than on a road as not only can they have serious injuries or drown but they can suffer from hypothermia if in the water for as little as 30mins, more often a combination of 2 or more noted.",
