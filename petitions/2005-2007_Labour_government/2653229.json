            "background": "Heavy ion therapy can be used to treat a variety of cancers with more success than traditional methods. For example, with liver tumour treatments the survival rate is improved from 23% to 100%. Such instruments are expensive, but given that they are currently being applied to conditions such as prostate cancer which is thought to affect 50% of males, the investment is essential. Germany and the US both already have some.",
