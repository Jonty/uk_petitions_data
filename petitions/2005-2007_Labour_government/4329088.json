        "background": "As the major road into Scotland the A1 should be dualed. The amount of traffic is destroying the single carriageway and it is falling into major disrepair due to lack of maintenance. Money is wasted on repairing a road in major need of a total overhaul. Money is wasted on yet more lay-bys and so called safety measures which only frustrate motorists into taking chances due to the traffic having to go so slow. We have to travel at 40 mph  on certain sections because the lorries are restricted and the state of the road. The road should be upgraded to make it safer and to regenerate and bring more business to the area.",
