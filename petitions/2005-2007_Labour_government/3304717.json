        "background": "This petition is created for one reason, and one reason only.  To make Tony Blair resign now, not at a time of his choosing.  He should have gone when he made false claims to us about weapons of mass destruction. He should have resigned over the death of prominent government scientific advisers. He should have gone when it became clear his government had lost the trust of the British people, and he should have gone when he was seen to be no more than a lap dog to The United States. If you want the Prime Minister to go now, you want to send him a very very clear, unambiguous message. RESIGN NOW, then please sign this petition today.",
