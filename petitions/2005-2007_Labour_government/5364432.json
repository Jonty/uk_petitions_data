        "background": "Driving on the roads of Britain has become a nightmare due to the huge increase in HGV's, whether uk or european owned. They create serious congestion by taking up all but one lane of the motorways thus forcing other drivers to slow and then accelerate (thus using more fuel and creating more emissions). It is obvious to myself that 1 electric or diesel locomotive can easily pull the equivalent of 50 trucks with far less emissions. Ok the government may have to subsidise things to start with but isn't that cheaper than wrecking the environment by widening roads that allow more trucks on the road to produce more emissions and congestion?\nWhat about the poor hard done by truckers? They'll be out of work? NO they get jobs on the railways!",
