            "background": "We invaded Iraq because Mr Blair and Mr Bush had faulty intelligence, through no fault of their own, that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction and also to set free the Iraqi people. Now, we have found 500 substances which come from WMDs dating from the 80s. However, they could potentially still be lethal. Saddam also ordered the hiding of the Iraqi nuclear program (as told by a top official) and an Iraqi border guard claimed that Saddam moved Iraq's WMDs to Syria before the war began. However. We MUST stay in Iraq until the job is done. If we leave now, we are being incredibly selfish by abandoning the Iraqis to death and terrorism, tenfold the figures of now. Please, let's stay in Iraq.",
