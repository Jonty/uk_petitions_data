            "background": "We ask the Prime Minister to put pressure on Hampshire County Council, to introduce a 30 mph speed limit on the B3004 in Passfield. This is a rural hamlet that is used as a rat run and we have no traffic calming measures in place. Only recently did a young lady lose her life on this notorious road, how many more lives must be lost for the authority's to sit up and listen to what we're saying. If Hampshire County Council had used the \u00a320,000 provided by a local developer, to build a pedestrian crossing on this road, then the recent death of that young lady could have been avoided. Please, support our campaign and sign this petition.",
