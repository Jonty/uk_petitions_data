        "background": "This would take Britain back to the Middle Ages! and would be totally barbaric.  The original petition makes the following points: that locking \"yobs\" up \"hasn't worked\" - neither would this as they would simply ensure they weren't found out - and doesn't teach them \"core social values\"; and public floggings would teach these values?! \"They want respect but don't understand it\"; in my opinion public floggings would do the reverse of helping them understand it.  And as for \"bringing them down a few pegs/giving them a taste of their own medicine\" such floggings might achieve that but would hardly civilise them!",
