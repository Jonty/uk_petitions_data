            "background": "The system is discriminative towards vulnerable groups. People that have disabilities don\u2019t have the fight to go through the struggle. Due to the constant messing around through tactics including misleading information, claims being processed through call centres with only one line, basically it\u2019s designed like you need a business adviser to claim. Most people with disabilities find this hard to cope with especially with mental illness which can make people go over the edge. These fraudsters than it\u2019s supposedly designed to catch have the strength to pursue with this .There must be a glitch in this system. As it\u2019s hurting the people it\u2019s supposed to protect. People may say it\u2019s nothing personal. In defence to this. The current system is like a disease it\u2019s Hurting the genuine sick people. Would people say it\u2019s ok for people to suffer with cancer as its nothing personal. Also a certain MP couldn\u2019t even last one day when he tried to show how easy it is on benefits.",
