            "background": "Despite some petitioners' call to ban children from playing football in the street, this activity is an important part of growing up, socialising and getting out and doing physical activity and not slumping in front of the television. While children playing can be annoying, if safe areas can be provided for them to burn off energy and socialise with their peers this will minimise the nuisance to residents. Children should be encouraged to undertake activities and not banned from doing a fun activity like this, as that is what leads to gang/mob culture, not a harmless game of kickabout in the street.",
