            "background": "We wish to ban old people from shopping after hours and at weekends, they have no place to go during this time, they have had plenty of hours during the day to get to the shops and back. They hold up queues and aisle and especially the till area with looking for change and packing their goods slowly. They only go to the shops to meet other OAP's and there are Darby and Jones clubs during the day for them to do this, they also buy only a couple of items and with them doing this block up shops with loads of old people deciding if they want Garibaldi Biscuits or Rich Tea. Also they should be at home well before 5.00pm giving the workers a hassle free drive to the shops.",
