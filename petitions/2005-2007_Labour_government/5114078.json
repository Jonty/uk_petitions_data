        "background": "Very simple really any mother or father who has experienced the wrath of Cafcass sign here, Cafcass are very much anti Father and often stop fathers from seeing children, it seems the only fathers that are encouraged to see their children are often the violent fathers, so therefore they let mothers and fathers alike down, I believe every cafcass worker should be handed their notice and the agency disbanded asap. Just never try to complain about them (they cover up complaints and invite the police to your house for harrassment) - trust me. Please sign this petition so parents like me can see their children again.",
