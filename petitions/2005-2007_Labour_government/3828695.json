            "background": "Much congestion is caused by parents transporting children to and from school.  With improved transport for school children, i.e. more school buses or coaches, or encouraging the placing of children in local schools so that they might walk, there will be less congestion on the roads.  This will also tackle the issue of road safety at school gates, as many obstructions are often made, thus increasing the risk of accidents.  \n\nIf the Government were to assist with funding for improved school transport, it would enable children to travel safely, and mean that travelling during rush hour would be cut considerably.  The Government needs to create local projects and work in partnership with schools to achieve this.",
