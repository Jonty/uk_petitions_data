        "action": "ask the Scottish Executive to oppose the proposal of closure for council run nursery schools in Edinburgh.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "If a closure plan is passed, by the elected councillors between June and August, children whose parents cannot afford private nursery fees will no longer receive a nursery education, run by teachers, thereby ending a long tradition of socially inclusive nursery education for all. We wish to object to the threat of closure over the Grassmarket nursery and High School yards nursery, and the sale of the land. The buildings are historically important to both areas. The grassmarket nursery is also a memorial given to the children of the area that where deprived of fresh air and freedom in 1925. Hence it being one of the longest established nurseries in Edinburgh. Both nurseries provide a stable and nurturing environment for low income families and ethnic minorities which will not recieve the same quality of care in the newly proposed 'Early Years Development Centres' for 0-5's. To create these will see the eradication and closure of 18 Council run nurseries in Edinburgh. That will see the loss of teachers being replaced by social workers.",
