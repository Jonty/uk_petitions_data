        "background": "After reading on the BBC website that undercover security staff are to travel on trains in the North, that was the last straw!\n\nPublic order is always 'out of order' when it comes to alcohol and why should anyone who comes into contact with the public like the Police, Ambulance/NHS staff and anyone working in public transport systems have their life threatened doing an 'honest nights work'? For too long there has been no legislation banning consumption of alcohol anywhere in public and on public transport. How much longer do we have to wait at the expense of innocent workers and the law abidding public?",
