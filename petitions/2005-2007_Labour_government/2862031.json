        "background": "Given the wealth distributed by corporations to the wealthy, it is inappropriate that this nation includes individuals so poor that basic necessities - shelter, security, amenities and privileges granted to householders - are beyond the reach of the underclass. Nor is the problem a simple one, being complicated by mental illness, drug habits, broken marriages and a myriad of other contributing factors. Nevertheless, a determined effort, funded (with a very marginal contribution) by those who have so much money to spare that they can afford to invest, could resolve these issues, and provide the least in our society with a fundamental requirement for a civilised existence,  contributing to a more equitable and stable nation.",
