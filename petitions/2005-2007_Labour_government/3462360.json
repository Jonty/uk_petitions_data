            "background": "As most continental trucking firms in the uk have to pay as soon as they get into europoe to drive on there roads. why should all the foreign trucks drive on our roads free of charge. as a driver myself i have been driving in europe for the last 20 years. The increase of foreign trucks have multiplyed by thousands coming to the uk. they do nothing to contribute to the wear and tear on our roads, but us the british public have to pay in one way or another. So its about time we done something about it. Lets get as many people byhind this so perhaps the goverment might realise that they could generate a fast income from this and stop putting on us to keep on paying.I will let this run untill the 1st of june. then if no forthcoming response from the goverment then another plan of action must be taken.",
