            "background": "Vehicle Excise Licence takes no account of Annual mileage.  A low carbon emission vehicle doing a high annual mileage probably produces as much polution as a high carbon emission vehicle doing a low annual mileage.  Alternatively, put the tax solely on fuel so those dodging the licence fee altogether also pay and those doing more mileage pay more for the damage to environment and to the roads.",
