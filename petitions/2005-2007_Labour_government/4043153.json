            "background": "The Dartford Bridge was finished in the early 1990's. It was promised, that the crossing toll would be quoshed after the bridge was paid for.....It has been paid for 3 times over, and now a french company take the money from the toll boothes.\nDoes this justify the traffic caused from the thousands of vehicles, queing to get through a booth?\nOn more than a few occassions, only one tunnel has been open, so all the traffic then has to try to get across 16 lanes of vehicles.\n\nLet us not forget the wind. I drive across the bridge daily. Whenever the bridge has been closed due to wind, it has never been windy! likewise, when i have literally been blown from one lane to the other, the bridge has remained open. obviously safety is not top priority and  money is!\nHelp us to oust companies like \"LE CROSSING\"",
