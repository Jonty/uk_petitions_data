            "background": "many disabled people are being discriminated against due to their housing needs. As most disabled people have very limited choices when they are deciding where and how they want to live. Firstly a large number of disabled people are unable own their own house due their income levels e.g. state benefits and also also the banks policies regarding lending to buy property. This means a lot of disabled people always forced into rented property.  Secondly a lot of council housing stock is to old to be properly adapted. Many disabled people are living in very inadequte housing that does not meet their needs. Also of the properties that have been adapted  most are not suitable for family life  so lifestyle choices can also be restricted .",
