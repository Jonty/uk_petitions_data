            "background": "This is a petition requesting that Great Britain stops the practise of some of it's councils exporting it's refuse (mostly plastics) to 3rd world countries, and, instead to start utilising the services of our recycling businesses here in the uk. - this may even create new jobs! Ultimately long term goal would be that every council in the land will have a full recycling service - plastics glass metal paper, and public will be safe in the knowledge that it is being recycled fairly - in our own country.",
