It is nothing short of harrassment and they don't seem to understand no for an answer, nor should I have to even say anything and just be left alone if I wish.\n\nWe call on the Prime Minister to ensure legislation to stop these people from hassling ordinary people going about their private business and make it mandatory that we can approach them but not the other way around. We have the right to privacy and this should be enforced.",
