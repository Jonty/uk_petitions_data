            "background": "At least one third of the residents of the United Kingdom display severe reaction to Monosodium Glutimate products, with symptoms ranging from severe migraine and dehydration to psychological episodes.\n\nWith the increased drive to reduce salt content in foods, many companies are resorting to boosting the 'taste enhancing' sodium content through the use of products such as Monosodium Glutimate, which has been known to be dangerous to a significant proportion of the population since the 1970s.\n\nWithout a ban on the use of these products, or at least, rigirius control, the levels of sickness in the workplace will increase, as will pressure on the health services and its scant resources.",
