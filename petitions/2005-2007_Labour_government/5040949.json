        "background": "It is hypocritical to allow MPs to use their parliamentary power to exempt themselves from the Freedom of Information Act. This is a very good example of the kind of behaviour that causes disenfranchisement with politics. It is well understood that private correspondence is exempt from the act in any case, and therefore the justification given for the bill cannot stand. In order to ensure that public confidence in politics and politicians is not further damaged, we urge the government to stop or if necessary repeal this legislation.",
