            "background": "On March 2nd HMRC on instruction from Mr Brown's Treasury Department, stopped groups of individuals obtaining loss relief on high risk and scientific ventures. The new rule means only \u00a325000 of losses will be allowed if scientific research or risky new companies fail to produce profits. This means groups of \"angels\" will not fund any risky venture or scientific research. This means scientists will leave the UK, new small companies will not be funded and individuals cannot fund risky research in the UK. Tens of thousands of companies will not be funded. Huge environmental projects will leave the UK. Hundreds of thousands of potential new jobs and income for UK PLC will not be created.",
