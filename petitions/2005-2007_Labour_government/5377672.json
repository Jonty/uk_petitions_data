            "background": "Our (the United Kingdom) defence budget is 59 billion US dollars per annum, the second highest expenditure next to that of the United States. However our troops are seen by the international communities as under funded due to the lack of kit available to UK troops, leading to preventable deaths in the field. My proposal is not to increase the defence budget, but to significantly reduce expenditure to beaurocracy, greatly improving our military stance internationally.",
