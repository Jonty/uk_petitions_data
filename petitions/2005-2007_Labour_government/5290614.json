            "background": "Former NIO health minister Bairbre de Brun chose to accept the recommendation of the Hayes report in 2002; by doing so, initiated the removal of acute hospital services from Omagh (County town of Tyrone) to Enniskillen (County town of Fermanagh, some 30 miles away). The removal of acute services means the removal of A&E from the hospital - a provision which will not be renewed once a new \u00a3100million Community hospital is built in the town. In its place will be an \u2018Urgent Care clinic\u2019 \u2013 staffed by GPs with no accident and emergency training. The removal of services will have many, many bad effects for the people of Tyrone - in emergencies, many will be 45 minutes from their nearest Accident and Emergency unit. The residents of Omagh, and Co. Tyrone, feel that this is unacceptable.",
