            "background": "Many companies produce study aids, e.g. revision guides, interactive websites, worksheets etc. but they have to try to cover the many different exam board specifications. This means students have to go through study aids with a fine-toothed comb to check what they need to revise for the exam board specification they are sitting.\n\nWouldn't it be better if all exam boards   had to produce these study aids, so students could spend less time working out the material they need to cover and more time actually covering it?",
