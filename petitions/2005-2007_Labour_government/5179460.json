            "background": "The Sovereign Bases on the island of Cyprus are UK military government on foreign soil. The UK could maintain military bases on the island without owning large areas of it, as it does around the rest of the world. This occupation is taking up valuable land from the Cypriots. As part of the Annan plan to reunify Cyprus, small area of farmland would have been handed over, but essentially nothing would have changed. In order to give greater encouragement for a settlement, and to give full reunification of the island, the UK should be prepared to hand over sovereignty of the entire base area to the reunified government. Or come clean as to the real reason sovereignty is required.",
