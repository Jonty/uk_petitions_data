            "background": "It is wrong that people who have lived carefully, saved, paid taxes and National Insurance all their working lives are denied free residential care at the end of their lives. \nMany older folk are unable to live independently in their own homes but are not regarded as in need of nursing care.\nIt makes no difference why a person is unable to live in their own home. \nVery few people make the lifestyle choice of living in a residential care home, they are forced into it due to circumstances, often out of their control. As such free residential home accomodation should be the right of all.",
