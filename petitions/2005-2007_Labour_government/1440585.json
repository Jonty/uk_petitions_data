        "background": "If you are unemployed or on a low income (eg in receipt of working families tax credit) currently you are not entitled to reduced fare travel on trains or buses. Therefore many people/families cannot afford to pay the full fare(s) and miss out on oppurtunities to travel & broaden their experiences in life and work. By offering reduced fares to low income households you will give many people the oppurtunity to travel who otherwise may not of been able to do so previously. The benefits are there for everyone to see so lets do something positive for the people of GB.",
