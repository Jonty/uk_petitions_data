            "background": "Personally I believe that 16 years old is too young to have sex. Many teenagers become pregnant to early in their lives and their live as a young person is not the same with a child. Teenagers are more likely to get a sexually transmitted disease than an adult. By raising the age to 18 teenagers might have the two years of their life which they wouldn't have had before.",
