            "background": "Synchronising traffic lights along a road so a motorist who travels at the speed limit gets a green light all the way. Those turning onto the road will receive one red light followed by all green. Roads crossing one another can be synchronised to reduce red lights. This will improve traffic flow and ensure the motorist obeys the speed limit as anyone travelling faster will get a red light but those travelling at the speed limit will always receive a green light. This is a low cost solution to congestion, safety and emissions that only requires synchronising traffic lights on each road.",
