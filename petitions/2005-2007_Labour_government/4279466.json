            "background": "The above proposal would necessitate that all retail establishments, enjoying the luxury of trading with members of the general public, be required by law, to provide the use of toilet facilities to whoever may wish to use them.\n\nAdopting the above social duty would greatly reduce the inconvenience, discomfort and time wastage many people suffer each year while attempting to locate such a toilet.\n\nCertain establishments would be exempt from the proposal such as very small premises and kiosks. Individual shops within shopping centres would also attract such an exemption when adequate facilities are provided by the centre management. Common sense should obviously prevail in these circumstances and in any situation where the retailer would suffer significant financial loss.",
