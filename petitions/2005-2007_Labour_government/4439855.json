            "background": "On 1st April 07 the NHS prescription charged was dropped throughout Wales. This followed the prior reduction of the charge by approximately 50%. The result is a complete financial disparity between Wales and rest of the UK. The scrapping of the charge has also been timed to coincide with the banning of smoking in public places on 2nd April 07, thereby supporting those smokers who are looking to quit, as well as cancer patients and those with chronic illnesses. If the Welsh Assembly believes this policy to be financially viable throughout Wales, why should it not be extended throughout the UK and Northern Ireland?",
