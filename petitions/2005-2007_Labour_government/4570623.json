            "background": "Since Virgin Trains introduced the Voyager and Super Voyager trains to the cross country route, they've become more and more over crowded - infact the number of people travelling on the network seems to have doubled since a year ago.\n\nVirgin has already been forced to hire a HST from Midland Mainline - to replace the one involved in the York Incident - which is just as overcrowded as a Voyager service, despite being 3/4 coaches longer than a voyager.\n\nThe Department for Transport is already taking matters into their own hands, by getting another company to operate the franchise, and to review the routing of the service - but this isn't really enough if the DfT/Gov. isn't going to start adding more carrages - something which is desperatly needed on such a long route, with some services operating from Aberdeen to Penzance.",
