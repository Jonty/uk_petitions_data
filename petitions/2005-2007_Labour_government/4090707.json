        "background": "I ask the Prime Minister to make it compulsory for all drivers (cars and motorbikes) to be re-tested with a normal driving test every 10 years.\nThis is to ensure that all drivers are still safe drivers.\nIt is totally unacceptable that some 70 year olds are still on the road, when they would have passed their driving tests over 50 years ago - roads and regulations have changed so much since then. These older drivers are some of the more dangerous drivers on our roads, and a re-test would ensure that they are safe and legal on our roads.\nRe-testing is a necessity to keep our roads safe.",
