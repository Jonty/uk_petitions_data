            "background": "We as children ourselves, believe that we should have a Ministry set up, for the Children of Great Britain. So far, children are limited rapidly to what they can do and have no say on how our country is run. This is disgraceful, as Children are just as important as adults. Although I believe that there should be some restrictions to what children can and can't do, but the way things are currently is appauling. Please sign our petition today!",
