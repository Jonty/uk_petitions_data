These people would be priced out of there jobs with this congestion charge and we the people look at it as another Tax just to pay for your failing policies.\nWe the people are already the most taxed motorists in the World and think that you should scrap this idea.\nWe also ask that you should look at rail and bus transport and improve these services before you start with another stupid charge",
