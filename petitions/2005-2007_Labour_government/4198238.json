        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In his 2007 Budget, the Chancellor announced a cut of 2p on the basic rate of income tax, in a clear attempt to win some votes. However, in a case of what can only be described as robbing Peter to pay Paul, he has decided to scrap the 10pc Income Tax Threshold. This is an insult to the lowest-earning people in our country who will subsequently be paying more tax than before in order to provide a benefit to those earning higher incomes. Anyone earning less than \u00a317,500 but above the personal allowance (\u00a35,035 in 2006/7) will be affected. It is still unclear as to exactly how the National Insurance re-alignment will happen, but it would appear that this increase will more than cover the cost of the 2pc decrease in the basic rate income tax, so there should be no need for the scrapping of the 10pc band.",
