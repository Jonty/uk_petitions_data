            "background": "Steve McClaren is having a negative effect on this nation.  He isn't just creating a destructive result on the senior England Football Team.  The result of this appalling management will spiral down through the age groups and the outcome will be less children interested in sport.  If this isn\u2019t satisfactory grounds for termination, then cast an eye over to the economy.  Qualification for the European Football Championships 2008 isn\u2019t just a football achievement.  Without qualification, many businesses would not boast the trade previously enjoyed in major tournaments.  How can one organisation with so much power, the English FA, be allowed to offer grossly exaggerated contracts to incompetent and inexpert individuals?  It is time for this authority to be revoked.  The people pay for their sport directly and indirectly.  Old men with wallets as motivation should not be permitted to affect the mood of a nation to this extent!",
