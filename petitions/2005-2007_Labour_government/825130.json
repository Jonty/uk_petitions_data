            "background": "Control over noise in residential areas, especially that between 2300 and 0700, is weak. There are control measures, but it is very difficult to bring them into operation and enforce them. It is necessary to suffer for a long time, obtain evidence, obtain local authority interest, apply to magistrates in certain instances, and then report the matter, and go through the whole procedure again. This can mean having to get out of bed numerous times to take down details of the source of noise, vehicle, property, etc. \nNoise which could disturb sleep should be banned banned between those hours, and anyone who wants to load/unload a lorry, conduct repairs (even emergency), play loud music, anywhere near where people live, should have to obtain permission to disturb the peace.\n \nSuch laws exist in various countries.",
