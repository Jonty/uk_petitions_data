        "action": "Abolish University Tuition Fees",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I propose that University tuition fees be abolished for students from England, N.I and Wales, as they are for Scottish students.\nUniversity tuition fees unfairly prevent many from entering higher education.\nFor those who are not barred or deterred, tuition fees lead to a future saddled with debt that takes years to pay off. \nUniversity fees and the debt they cause do not reflect the highly competitive nature of the graduate jobs market - a good degree does not guarantee your future. Therefore it is easy to see why prospective students may be deterred.\nFurthermore, if the Government is serious about encouraging Britons to want to stay in education, this measure is vital. It is imperative that as many youngsters enter higher education as possible, so that Britain can compete on the international stage in the jobs and industrial markets in the future.\nAlso, in the interest of fairness, what applies to Scotland regarding tuition fees should also apply to the rest of the UK.",
