How can we keep banging on about cutting CO2 levels then go and fit a device that converts fuel emissions to CO2. Yes, we did need a way to cut harmful exhaust emissions but not to the cost of our planet! How was this considered as a viable option? Catalytic Converters just mask a problem so the government doesn't have to solve it.",
