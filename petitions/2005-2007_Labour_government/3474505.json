        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is common knowledge that England has an ongoing problem with binge drinking with regards to the health, social and economic consequences.\n\nMost countries in Europe such as France and The Netherlands do not have this problem as alcohol is not regarded as a tool to cause intoxication, but rather a part of life. These countries have a lower drinking age.\n\nThe lower drinking age would:\n \n - Increase tax revenue as those aged 16-17 would be more likely to buy alcohol in the UK rather than buying abroad.\n \n - Reduce the fascination with alcohol as a \"grown-up\" thing, reducing some binge drinking from those who need reassurance they are over 18, or would like to act it by being immature.\n\nIt goes without saying that the undersigned are against the proposed increase in the drinking age from 18 to 21.\n\nOne's abiliy to control one's self is based on many things of which age does not seem to appear.",
