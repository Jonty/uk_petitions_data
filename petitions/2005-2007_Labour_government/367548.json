            "background": "There should be a limit on \"net\" immigration into the UK of 15000 per year. This figure would include all immigration, EU, non EU commonwealth etc. One of the many benefits of this would be to reduce housing shortage, reduce burden on infrastructure on roads, schools and social services and decrease taxes. This is by no means a racist issue as some would have you believe. It is simply a matter of economics and size. We are a small Island and simply cannot hold any more people. We must therefore look after the people we already have here, both immigrants and British citizens.",
