            "background": "Like other forms of privatisation (see also the more general petition), Civil Service outsourcing makes Governement services more expensive.  This is because the private company taking on the work has to make a profit.  \n\nIt also conceals the true size of the Civil Service, giving a lack of transparency that would disgrace a banana republic.  \n\nFinally, it causes immense distress to those employees who are sold with their posts as business assets.  Only some of their terms and conditions are protected by EC TUPE legislation.",
