        "background": "Since we have all been brainwashed into believing that the climate is about to go into thermal runaway, unless we all stop breathing out carbon dioxide (and persuade China and India et al to give up their industrial development), our only hope now is to move the planet slightly further away from the Sun. This should be done slowly at first, taking care to keep us in the 'Goldilocks'zone, as we spiral out over the next five billion years, to compensate for the even more serious problem of the Sun turning into a red giant. At this point we must be very careful not to collide with Mars, and thereafter contemplate our return strategy for when the Sun becomes a white dwarf. This is obviously a long-term project, and our PM will need to use his proven capability to mobilise international support from the other, less dynamic World Leaders. We don't want to leave it until it's too late this time.",
