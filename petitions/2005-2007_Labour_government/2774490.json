            "background": "Many patients are refusing to eat hospital food and some nurses even adivse that they would never eat it, this means that families have to bring in home-cooked meals to patients.  Often ovens are left in wards next to beds for three hours to cook sloppy food which often makes patients feel more unwell.  How can we combat super-bugs and free-up much needed hospital beds patients when sick people are fed over-processed slop which is worse than a prison meal?  It doesn't make sense.  Please lend your support to this cause.",
