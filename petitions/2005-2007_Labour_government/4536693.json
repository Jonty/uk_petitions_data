            "background": "There are many children going through the educational system who are being held back and not achieving their potential because they do not get the help they need. Many parents cannot afford to give their children a private education and so must rely on state schools, many of which do not cater for the unusually bright. It is time for more funding to be made available for gifted children just as there is money for those with other educational needs. Gifted children need provision for a more sophisticated level of learning and access to culture and the arts. They need support regarding the emotional difficulties and loneliness that come with intelligence. For pupils to reach their potential, schools need money and resources. Gifted children should be able to declare themselves as having special educational needs",
