            "background": "The Prime Minister should clearly state which side of the fence that he sits upon, in connection with the outpourings of one minister who has suggested that a council tenant should not expect to live in council property for any continued length of time.\n\nThe same minister has also stated that council rents should be linked to means testing, so that rents will be increased in line with the earning capacity of the tenant.\n\nThe right to a secure tenancy was won during the Victorian era, in order to avoid exploitation at the hands of private landlords. Any policy implemented upon the above lines could merely push more people into the hands of exploitative landlords.\n\nPlease show your support, and avoid a return to Victorian type policies. Remember that it is usually the poor and disadvantaged who will ultimately pay the price.",
