            "background": "I suggest that more wind turbines and tidal barrages are built, see my other petition WightBarrage and another petitioner's for a Severn Estuary barrage, tax breaks  given for all installations of solar panels, and new cleaner coal burning power stations built to make up any shortfall when wind turbines and solar panel output is unable to fulfil demand.\nNuclear power is the dirtiest form of energy, much dirtier than carbon emmitting power stations especially as global warming / climate change happens naturally and may only be partially or not even caused by human activity. Safely disposing of nuclear waste is a serious problem as it has a 'half-life' of many thousands of years. People who live near a nuclear reactor inevitably receive a dose of radiation when there is a leak.\nNuclear reactors can explode, e.g.: Chenobyl in 1986! Fallout reached Britain, many hundred of miles away where some farmland was contaminated. Just imagine the consequences if a nuclear reactor exploded in Britain! Like the vicinity of Chenobyl, it would make a large vicinity of Britain uninhabitable for thousands of years!!!!",
