            "action": "Introduce legislation requiring all newly built houses to have underground water tanks installed. These could be sited underneath drives, garages and patios for the collection and recycling of rainwater. Such tanks would provide households with water storage for car-washing and garden use that far exceeds the capacity of water butts, without their ugly visibility. In addition to providing employment opportunities, such legislation would encourage a more responsible approach to the environment from house developers. The government should also give water grants to owners of pre-2007 properties willing to have tanks installed under existing drives or patios. What we need now are some innovative designs for a range of tanks to suit different properties and locations.",
