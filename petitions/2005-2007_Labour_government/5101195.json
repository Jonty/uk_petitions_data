I appreciate that with any audience based event you can find fault with people\u2019s lack of respect for their fellow punter, you pay your money and you take your chances. However, there are some things which are becoming intolerable. \n\nWhen I\u2019m at a gig or concert I\u2019m sure I\u2019m not alone in wishing people would put away their cameras and camera phones? I don\u2019t see why I should have to watch the band through a sea of arms all trying to record the event, it\u2019s nigh on impossible to ignore a bright LCD screen waving around in your line of sight.",
