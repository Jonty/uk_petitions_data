All political parties should be abolished and we should live under Tony Blair as leader. \n\nWe can then implement a far more authoritarian police force and create a secret police to stop anti social behaviour.\n\nAll the totalitarian states of the 20th  century ultimately failed but thats because they were run by military despots. Lets change the stigma of totalitarianism by making Blair, Emperor Blair.",
