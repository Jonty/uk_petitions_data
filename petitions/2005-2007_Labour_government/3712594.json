            "background": "so that young people are not put under the intense presure that the league tables create, so that they feel more like people than statistics and numbers in a box. It also would allow people who are written of as failures and not seen worthy of achiving, a better start to education, because there would be less competitivness and divisions that we see in schools today. Overall creating a fairer and more equal education system, where the teachers can have more time for the young people, without having to constantly consult with the so called league tables.",
