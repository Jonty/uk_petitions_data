Now there is a crazy system of EVERYTHING going through France for all European countries.\nFrance is not even central in Europe and the Paris embassy does not answer the telephone, does not respond to faxes or email. The Website for this is not even in English as the default language! It is extremely inconvenient and subject to all sorts of delays as the fee structures are not clearly explained, thus anything other than the EXACT amount (even if too much)transferred will delay passport renewals.",
