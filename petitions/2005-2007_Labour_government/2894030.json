            "background": "25 years ago the Government of the time broke the link between pensions and wages and linked pensions to prices.\nSince that time the value of the state pension when compared with wages has been eroded considerably.\nThe present Government has stated that it is minded to re-introduce the link in 2012, but this will mean that many pensioners will never benefit from this increase as they may die in the meantime.\nIn fairness the link must be re-introduced NOW",
