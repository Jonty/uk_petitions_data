            "background": "British Citizens accompanying their Non-EU visa-national spouses on visits to the UK are denied entry to the UK as a couple if they travel without a valid visa. Couples must decide, either travel alone, or not at all. Meanwhile, Non-British EU citizens and their Non-EU visa national spouses are free to visit without any undue formality or cost. Under current European law, EU citizens, who are not British themselves, are able to exercise their right under the Freedom of Movement Treaty, to have their spouse travel with them on visits to the UK, regardless of that person's immigration status or nationality. So the bizarre effect of this is that couples get greater protection of their Article 8 rights in an EU country other than their own.\nWe, demand free-movement rights and fair and equitable treatment for our spouses whatever their nationality, and regardless of the British citizen's country of domicile.",
