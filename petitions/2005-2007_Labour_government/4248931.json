            "background": "Lately we have heard about young men being stabbed or viciously assaulted on our streets. Most parents worry about violent attacks, muggings and even murders on our streets.   Why are these attackers so angry and obviously have so much hate in them to commit these awful acts?  The people who commit these crimes need help from early on in their lives.  Perhaps they have poor parenting, little love and security, have suffered abuse and violence, growing up in poverty and have no respect for themselves or others.  A child brought up in a loving, secure home does not want to commit acts like this.  Obviously there will be exceptions to this but not on the whole. Our children are our future. We are as responsible for the child doing the violence as we are for our own child.",
