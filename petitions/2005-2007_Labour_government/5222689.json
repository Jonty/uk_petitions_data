            "background": "Liverpool and its hinterland is a unique cultural entity within the UK. It has a distinct regional character which it doesn't share with Manchester or the north of England. The UK government should recognise this by giving Liverpool, Knowsley, Sefton, Wirral, Halton and St Helens a separate regional developement agencey, regional assembly - preferably elected with at least the powers that the London Assembly has, and make the area a NUTS1 Euro-region, complete with it's own MEP constituency. Government Office Merseyside should be restored, the NHS authority for the area should be restored and all other emergency services retained. Any other existing North West quangos and authorities should be replaced with Liverpool/Merseyside equivalents and should be accountable to the people and the councils they elect to serve them.",
