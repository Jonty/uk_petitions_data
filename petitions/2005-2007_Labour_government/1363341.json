            "background": "In South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa 50 million births go unregistered every year. \n\nWithout birth registration a child is denied: Healthcare, imunization, School enrolment, protection from child labour, protection from forced marriage, a nationality and protection from trafficking. \n\nLack of birth registration occurs in countries where the government allocates insufficient funds for this purpose or where the poverty of the nation necessitates priorities other than birth registration. Also, children from poor families sometimes cannot afford expensive child registration fees, and many families from rural areas cannot cover the cost of travel to urban centres where registration centres are typically located. Other parents do not understand the importance of birth registration or are uncertain about how to register their children.",
