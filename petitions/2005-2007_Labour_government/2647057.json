            "background": "The REACH law (Registration Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals) aims to test on animals thousands of chemicals, a vast amount of which will be used in cosmetics and household products. The UK stopped testing cosmetic ingredients to animals in 1998 and is currently the strictest country defending animals rights. Nonetheless if REACH is voted by the European Parliament, something like 45 or 50 million animals may suffer and die in labs, in tests that have little scientific value and only serve human vanity.In the name of education and civilization we cannot let this happen.",
