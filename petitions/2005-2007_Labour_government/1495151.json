        "action": "Stop home made Biofuels as they are damaging modern fuel systems in the motor industry, without the knowledge of the consumer.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "More and more motorists are finding ways to reduce fuel costs. The high fuel prices have caused home made Bio fuel manufacturers to market their product as ecologically friendly and enables better fuel consumption. The major fuel manufacturers of diesel systems have stated that their system cannot withstand more than 5% bio fuel and therefore these home made bio fuel suppliers are causing more damage to unsuspecting customers. This practise affects the quality of the motor vehicles because one cannot prove which fuel caused the damage the customer will eventually pay for the fuel systems to be replaced.",
