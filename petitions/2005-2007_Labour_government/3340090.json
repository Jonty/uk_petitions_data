            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Our Victorian town-centre railway stations were originally built when the majority of rail  travellers lived within easy distance of their local station. Nowadays, most residential areas are out of town on housing developments built nearer to the road network, and roads are built to serve housing developments. \n\nIf main railways stations were moved out of town, nearer to the road network, town centre traffic and car park congestion would be reduced by moving long distance travellers away from town centres. Town centre railway stations could be scaled down to carry local travellers only, with hopper trains interconnecting town-centre and out-of-town stations.\n\nFurther, if a very-high speed rail network was built, interconnecting major out-of-town rail hubs, the loading on our motorway network would be reduced, along with highly polluting national air travel.",
