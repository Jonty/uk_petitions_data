            "background": "Every year, hundreds of beloved pet cats are run over and killed on our roads but it is not a legal requirement to report an accident involving a cat, as it is with dogs.  Cats are not classed as animals within the Protection of Animals Act 1911, from where the rules stem.  Cats as pets are no less loved than dogs and careless drivers should have to report it to the Police if they are involved in an accident with a cat.  Many owners whose cats simply didn't come home would have achieved closure had the drivers concerned been legally required to report the accident to the Police.",
