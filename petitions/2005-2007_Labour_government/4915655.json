            "background": "Riders like myself are finding it more and more harder to find places to go and practice motocross and any other off road sport as places are getting shut down due to noise restrictions. Therefore more people are starting to ride in out of bound areas that are not allowed. If there were more official practice tracks available in areas that would not disturb the public with time and day limitations this solve the problem. Thanks",
