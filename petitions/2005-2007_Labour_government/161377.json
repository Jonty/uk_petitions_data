        "background": "Over the past decade, the drink that most embodies the festive spirit has seen a dramatic decrease in consumption.  If we are not careful, we could lose eggnog forever...All I am asking is for publicans to offer eggnog during Advent,  perhaps customers could have the option of receiving their change from transactions in eggnog, as opposed to pounds sterling.  Let's save this seasonal drink, the pandas and white rhinos can wait until the new year; make December the time for loving your family, telling the one you want but never have the balls to outwardly tell them that you love them, hug your friends, call your ex and say sorry, solve the world's problems...All washed down with eggnog.  I may no longer believe in Father Christmas but I do believe in eggnog.",
