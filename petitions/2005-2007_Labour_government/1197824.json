In University towns student HMOs create a loss of tax revenue.It is unacceptable that landlords making very large profits should not pay for services which their tenants enjoy as much as any other citizen! We could have\nmore community resources if this deficit was put back into the public purse!\nThe National HMO Lobby advocates amendment of Section 66 of the Local Government Finance Act(1988) such that HMOs no longer qualify as domestic property and thereby become subject to Business Rate-Landlords can\u2019t have it both ways!",
