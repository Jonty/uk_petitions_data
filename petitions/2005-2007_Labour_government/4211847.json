            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The proposal to scrap the 10p in the \u00a3 tax level will hit the people the chancellor purports to care about the most. The proposed tax changes will mean that my family will be \u00a315 per month worse off. The rise in child benefit to \u00a320pw by 2010 for the first child is to offset this? In real terms 3.75% rise over 4 years 2007,2008,2009 and 2010 ammounts to around 70pence per week rise per year for each first child. People on relatively low incomes who dont have children have not been offered any kind of \"sweetener\". Fact - people on incomes of between \u00a315k-\u00a325k pay proportionally more tax than people on higher salaries. \n\nThe chancellor, for all his reputed social conscience, has offered the people of this country on relatively low incomes nothing but a poisened chalice.\nI urge you now to direct the chancellor to search his social conscience and perform a political, fiscal and very popular U-turn on aboloshing the 10p in the \u00a3 tax allowance.",
