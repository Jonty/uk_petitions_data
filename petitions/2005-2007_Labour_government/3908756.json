        "action": "Abolish road tax and recover equivalent revenue through duty tax so high users pay more, low users don't",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is unfair that low mileage road users pay the same tax as high mileage users. People who own more than one are also penalised twice. Some people need a large car, but may use it infrequently, but some may have a smaller car but use it extensively. By recovering revenue based solely on usage, it encourages people to limit the use of their car and to buy more ecconomical cars, but doesn't not unfairly penalise occassional use.\n\nSignificant savings could also be made on the administration and collection of this duty, or resources diverted to insurance avoidance.",
