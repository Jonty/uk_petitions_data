Regardless of whether they are from Africa,India,the EU or even the Southern America,anyone legitimately seeking residency in this country should be able to speak comprehensible and audible English and fit in with society (rather than be a drain on it) & NOT be covered by shroud\u2019s or head dresses in the name of religion.",
