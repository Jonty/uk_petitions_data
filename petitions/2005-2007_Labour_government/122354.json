It does not set a fit model for one of the World's oldest nation states.\n\nThis is not to say that the Royals do their job badly , or that a Republic would be cheaper , or that the human beings in either institution would not be fallible.\n\nWhat it does say is that feudal relics , operating by hereditary principles have no place in the government of this great nation.\n\nThat some form of Republican government says what and where we want to be.\n\nWhat was once in 1649 - 1660 can be again !",
