            "background": "Treble council tax on hoilday homes because of the damage they cause to rural communities. As these second homes are empty for half the year it means that local shops, schools and business struggle to survive, damaging the local community. House prices are also pushed up so young people who want to live in the village they grew up in can't, even though the houses are empty most the time. The money raised should then be put into affordable housing schemes or the local area.",
