            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The problem with government and tax increases today is that they only effect the people that cannot afford them. For people in Senior jobs or those earning significant salaries around the \u00a375k or above bracket, an increase in road tax or fuel duty etc would have virtually no effect on them. Why not use this fact to lower taxes on the least well off and middle classes and increase tax for the well off by introducing a new tax bracket of 50% (for example). Because of the salaries involved with these people, they will still be significantly better off than the rest of the population but they will also more than make up for the reduced income to the government by covering the tax defecit!\n\nThe only downside I can see for this is that people with money also tend to have power and may be less keen to support the government as a result of this. However, no government should be swayed by this and should always aim to do what is right and not what is in their best interests !!!",
