Post-code lotteries on prescribing life-saving drugs, too few medical personnel such as doctors, nurses, paramedics, etc., hospitals closing down... the list is endless.  We are a rich country; the problem is not that we haven't got the money but that it's spent on death (Iraq), and irrelevant sporting jamborees (the Olympics) rather than saving people's lives.  A sporting spectacular like the Olympics is no use to someone who has died waiting for a life-saving drug or operation!",
