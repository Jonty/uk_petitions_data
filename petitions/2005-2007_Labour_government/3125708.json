        "background": "In view of the madness that joining the European Union has brought upon this once great country, we petition to pull out of europe and re-establish what used to be our own country. A rather simply put petition that could rectify issues too numerous to mention but which effects millions. \n\nI am not the most obvious of people to start such a petition but I am sure this is one of the strongest issues not petitioned so far.\n\nNo party has come to light to back such a move and nobody has thought of creating the party everybody craves. A truly British party.\n\nWe know this petition will have as much effect as throwing a pebble into the sea but it 'may' influence those less than inadequate parties who are available to vote for into taking up this point and using it as a means to win an election. Believe me it would.\n\nPlease support this petition for our future.",
