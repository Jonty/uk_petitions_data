            "background": "As many of us know, it costs around \u00a350.000 per year just to keep a convict in prison, and thats without paying for re-offending programs on their release from prison, and yet as a nation we can not afford to prioritise or pay our pensioners a decent index-linked pension.\n\nSo whats part of the solution? please read the following points below and sign this petition if you agree in principle:\n\n1, Ship all prisoners and anti social members of our society to a desolated mid atlantic island to never be released.\n\n2, Issue them with ex army tents and a bag of seeds to grow there own food, (ship back to mainland UK any fresh excess food for our homeless and pensioners). \n\n3, Physically brand every prisoner on the face, and take DNA samples alongside the latest security measures to stop them coming back home.\n\n4, Turn and revamp our existing prison buildings into cheap affordable housing or community social centres for our less well paid members of society.",
