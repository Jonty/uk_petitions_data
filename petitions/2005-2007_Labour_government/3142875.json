            "background": "The introduction of Identity Cards represents a major change in the relationship between the people and the Government by placing the interests of the State above those of the people.  \n\nIt will achieve this by creating the final brick in the edifice of the surveillance state. The people should be allowed to go about their business without let or hinderance or living in fear of becoming \"non persons\" as was commonplace in the former Soviet Union by excercising a power to withdraw a card, or refusing to issue one.",
