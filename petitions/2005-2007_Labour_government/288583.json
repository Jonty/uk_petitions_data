        "background": "We, as British drivers, already pay far too much tax to use our vehicles.  I propose that the current road tax be abolished as we are already paying too much tax on fuel.\nThis system would also be fairer, as the ones who use the roads more, already pay more, as they use more fuel.\nThis would also stop us from being over-taxed, I believe we should have the freedom to choose the vehicle we drive without fear of  being charged more because of our choice.\nInstead of a tax disk, Insurance and MOT should supply disks for display in the windscreen of our vehicles, this would also make it easier for policing of uninsured or unsafe vehicles.",
