            "background": "We ask this as this unit has recently been closed down. Thus meaning that all those who are expecting their babies, consequently face a 4hr journy to Watford General Hospital. It has become common knowledge that this hospital does not have the staff, the equipment or the pacience to deal with such a High volume of births. Women in labour are being turned away due to overcrowding. Cesareans are being performed to hurry things up and an average of 12 babies a week are born in Watford Generals Car Park! This is unacceptable. No warning was given about the closure of this unit. During the christams period (2006) the ward closed due to staff sickness and was never re-opened. The 3 year old dept is now being used as office space.",
