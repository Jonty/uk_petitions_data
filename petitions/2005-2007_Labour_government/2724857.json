            "background": "It is recognised that increased public monies have supported our national Hospice network and indeed significant monies made available for capital (buildings) costs etc. However this public contribution is only a tiny % of hospice costs and for many children's hospices amounts to only a tiny fraction of running costs.\n\nThe petition proposes that public monies are found to fund all Hospices up to say 49% or 50% of costs thus ensuring Hospices remain autonomous in local decision making and are as independent as they can be.\n\nThe petition proposes that either (A) public monies are saved/re-allocated from current public expenditure (eg: unproductive Management Consultancy fees/doubtful and expensive multi-million/billion pound public 'service' computer projects) or that (B) a small tax be levied on products harmful to the person and/or environment. The new tax would be ring-fenced for investment solely for developing end of life care and especially the Hospice network.\n\nBill Givens",
