If his advice had been listened to in the pub over the last few years, England would have won the world cup four times and the European Championship twice.\n\nEngland expects, and Alastair Woolley would like the chance to take his skills out of the living room and onto the pitch. After all, what have we got to lose?\n\nThank you.",
