            "background": "The two main British branded premium car manufacturers left in this country are Jaguar and Land Rover. We should be proud of them. Why on earth would Gordon Brown increase the road tax to target their vehicles to the benefit of our competitors. The rumoured road tax increase for large cars will significantly hit residual values and consequently volumes of new cars sold.\n\nThe grants to science and technology research are currently being savaged following the use of the funds to deal with the Rover collapse. These are the same scientists and technologists who could deliver greener engine and driveline sytems!\n\nIf The Chancellor insists on a damaging but populist increase please ensure the money is used to bolster the pension guarantee fund ready for the time when the move won't look too popular.",
