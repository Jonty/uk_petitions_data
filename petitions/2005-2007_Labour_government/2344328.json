        "action": "Prevent local authority licensing departments using the Disability Discrimination Act to force Taxi drivers into buying expensive wheelchair accessible Taxis instead of allowing mixed fleets of saloon cars and wheelchair accessible vehicles.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Under the Disability Discrimination Act, Local authorities are demanding that all Taxis be wheelchair accessible. This means that instead of a comfortable saloon car, passengers will be forced to travel in either a 'London' type Taxi or a van conversion. Since these options are unsuitable for many elderly and disabled people and remove freedom of choice for the able bodied, I ask that the prime minister be petitioned to allow common sense to prevail and let local authorities to continue with the mixed fleets of Taxis that the travelling public enjoy at present.\nNot only is this unfair to the majority of Taxi users, it imposes a severe financial burden on the Taxi driver who is self financing and receives no subsidy or financial assistance whatsoever.\nIn the interest of fairness and common sense, please sign this petition now!",
