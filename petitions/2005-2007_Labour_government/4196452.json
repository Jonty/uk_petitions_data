            "background": "The UK Blood Transfusion Service currently places a blanket ban on all gay and bi-sexual men from donating blood.\n\nThe ban takes no account of the age or lifestyle of the donor, nor does it prevent gay or bisexual men who do not reveal their true sexual orientation from donating blood.\n\nThe effectiveness of the ban cannot therefore be scientifically researched.\n\nHowever a seriously damaging message is sent out to the whole population that gay and bi-sexual men are automatically carriers of disease",
