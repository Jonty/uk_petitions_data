        "background": "Steve McClaren was part of the previous regime that saw England football team become a boring passionless team.  McClaren has continued this in his roll as manager and has even built on it so that Sven now looks like he was a great and charismatic manager in comparison.  If McClaren does not go very soon England fans will all be able to plan their 2008 summer holidays without worrying about clashes with England matches in the European Championship.  Sign the petition and lets get McClaren out!!",
