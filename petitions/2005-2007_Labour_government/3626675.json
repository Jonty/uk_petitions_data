It should go to America or Asia. Football should come home to Britain. \n\nSure America or Asia has an argument but none as strong as ours.\n\nProve that football can come home. Prove that we have the best stadia, the best fans and the best argument to hold the World Cup. \n\nVote now or we lose our chance!",
