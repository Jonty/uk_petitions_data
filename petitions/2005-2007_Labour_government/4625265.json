All people seem to do is point the fingure at aviaton when they do not know the real facts and the research that is going into new aviation fuels. They also ignore that aircraft engines get much more efficient for every new version than other transport engines do. They also forget when thinking of carbon footprints that the planes is not only holding you, but 120-450 others and travelling at speeds of 500mph.",
