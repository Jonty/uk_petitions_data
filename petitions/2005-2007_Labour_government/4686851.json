            "background": "Transport for London has stopped the tidal flow system at the Blackwall Tunnel, thus adding an extra 30mins - 1 hour onto the time it takes to cross the river. This adds pollution and costs the local economy millions. they have cited safety reasons - where as i believe that it is to create more congestion so that they can bring in an extra congestion charge zone. This needs to be reinstated to stop the strangulation of Londons drivers - who drive out of neccessity - Not choice through this route.",
