        "action": "abolish strict planning laws in north pennines to allow landowners to build eco friendly log cabins on a small scale  for residential or holliday use\".",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Hill farming and small holding is in decline with many farms   \nstruggling to survive many have already gone. Some council planning officers responsable for the North Pennines have in effect stopped such small developments in their tracks. But allowing landowners to build small scale developments will benifit many,  residential properties have been sold and are being used only as holiday homes, barns and ruins too, this is a double edged sword some are making a lot of money  out of rural properties, but we all are losing our tradesmen.  Small scale log cabin developments will give an alternative, this would not harm the landscape but would allow tourists access to the north pennines and the many walks in that area, so all would benefit, remember its been the Landowners and Farmers who have kept our countryside as breathtaking as it is without their care for the land many spectacular walks and views may have been inaccessible to many, so please support this worthwhile petition Thank you",
