OK, it is tarmac now, but it should have been dualed ages ago to stop overtake collisions.\nThe situation is further ridiculous, because central government will not release funding for this urgent work, yet it costs the public purse \u00a31m per fatality and with the number of regular fatalities on this road, it could have been paid for already several times over!\nSTOP THE CARNAGE IN NORFOLK!",
