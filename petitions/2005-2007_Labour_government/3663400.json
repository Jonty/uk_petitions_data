        "background": "The government does not provide any compensation to its civilians who become victims of terror abroad. However, the government does provide compensation for its civilians who become victims of terror within the UK. The government also provides compensation to non British nationals who become victims of terror at home (for example non British victims of the 7/7 tube bombings have received compensation).  \n\nThe government also provides an abroad compensation package for military personnel injured while off duty abroad.\n\nIt is widely acknowledged that the World has changed post 9/11 but it is my view that the British government has failed in its duty to consider the implications of that event on the travelling 60 million British public.",
