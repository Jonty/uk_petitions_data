            "background": "There are obviously serious privacy issues with tracking a vehicle and logging journeys, i also feel it be invasive.  I propose a new method which makes it more cost effective to run a car, while also being fair.  Scrap the road tax and at least half of the fuel duty and then legislate that as part of the MOT test the milage on the car has to be recorded (with photographic evidence) and compared to the year before.  The cost of your yearly road usage calculated against the reading of the cars odometer, rather than where you have been. The first three years for a new car (where no MOT is needed) the car must be booked in to have its milage recorded.",
