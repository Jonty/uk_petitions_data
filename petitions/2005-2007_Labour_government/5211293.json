We've reduced our fat intake, we're eating less salt and - mmm, we promise to eat our oily fish. Seriously, enough is enough. While some of us might quite enjoy the idea of receiving orders from Caroline Flint, she really shouldn't be taking \u00a310 million of our money to tell us off. Target under-age drinkers, weekend binge drinkers, aggressive drinkers and park-living cider drinkers by all means (though a greater police presence might be more effective than yet another advertsing campaign or 'public debate') but leave us law-abiding, tax-paying, Shiraz-drinkers in peace. Please.",
