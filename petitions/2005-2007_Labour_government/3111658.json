Worthing and Southlands hospitals serve us well and are needed by our community. People will die if A&E is closed because the roads are congested which would mean delay in treatment. Recently Royal Sussex County had to send paitents to Worthing because they could not cope!! so how would they manage if Worthing A&E was closed?",
