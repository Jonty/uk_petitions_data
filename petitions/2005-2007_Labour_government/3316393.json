        "action": "think again on the introduction of legislation termed \"Deposit Protection Scheme\" it is not well thought out, will be costly to implement, cause undue hardship and loss to the majority of good landlords, allow uncaring tenants to escape from their responsibilities to care for properties they rent, place additional burden on the over streched legal services of the courts in cases of disagreement and argument, provide further avenues of revenue to solicitors, additional financial burdens on the Government services in respect of tenants making false or minor claims and actions with legal aid assistance. The implications of private landlords opting out of renting their empty properties will cause less rental properties becoming available and place further burden on the already under stocked and lack of social housing desperately required, causing more people to become homeless. There are alternatives that have not been considered by the minister or department of government who have introduced this ill thought out legislation with little thought being given to consequence.",
