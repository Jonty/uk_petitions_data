            "background": "How annoying it is to phone a company to be told you are in a queue, but never be told how long it will be before you will speak to someone, or the number of callers ahead of you in that queue.\nIf the Regulator makes these businesses tell you, it will enable the customer to decide if to hang up or wait.  At present, you keep getting told how long you are in the queue and that your call is valued.\nPoor companies would then be identified and the individual's phone bill will be reduced, less time wasted waiting for an operator and the public would probably be more patient and not so rude!\nIf a company is interested in customer service, prove it!",
