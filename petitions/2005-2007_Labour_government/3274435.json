        "background": "I have been a certificated bailiff for nearly twelve years and am astonished to see the vastly different policies adopted by different authorities across England and Wales in the recovery of council tax. \nMany do use bailiff legislation, but are reluctant to proceed further if this is unsuccessful. I am dismayed at above inflation council tax rises year on year, at the same time as the writing off of vast somes of uncollected council tax. The legislation is in place to collect more,so lets use it.",
