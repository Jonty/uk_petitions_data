        "background": "The government should create policy which financially rewards women or men who as part of a couple choose to stay at home and look after children and recognises their value to society. It should stop creating policy which encourages women to work while handing over the care of their children to surrogate carers. Women can be valuble, useful members of society by staying at home during their children's early years. The government should make them feel good about it instead of inadequate. Society would improve along with the moral of families.",
