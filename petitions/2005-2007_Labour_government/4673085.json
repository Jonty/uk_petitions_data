            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This is a practical proposal for rationalising the tax system as it applies to these areas. At present, collecting the tax in the form of a \"death duty\" is unpopular and gives rise to many tax-avoidance schemes. Instead, each beneficiary should pay the tax as an individual Capital Gains Tax (which it is). It is estimated that this would result in an excessive tax burden so, to reduce the total tax to present levels, it is also proposed that an individual tax-free allowance of (say) \u00a3100,000 be applied for any part of the inheritance which is placed in a personal pension scheme. The beneficiary would then pay CGT on the excess. As well as other advantages, this proposal would ease the present difficulties many have over their pensions.",
