            "background": "In this country thousands of families everyday are being left without money to feed and look after their families, because the Government allow Income Support payments and Child Tax Credits to be stopped without warning, these families are already treated like 2nd class citizens, and made to feel guilty.  This results in families not having any money and being left destitute.\nIt is important to remember that many who live on state handouts do so for very valid reasons, and should not be made to feel guilty!!!\nHow can we be a civilised society when we treat people in such a deplorable manner, it is totally unacceptable, and should be stopped immediately, after all they are WELFARE BENEFITS.\nIt would be common courtesy to give notice of any changes to payments so that families can try and make contingency plans, so as to avoid bank charges and other penalties for late payments of bills.\nIT IS TIME THAT THE GOVERNMENT TOOK ACTION TO PROTECT THOSE IN NEED - NOW !!!",
