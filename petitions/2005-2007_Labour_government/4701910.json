        "background": "There is increasing evidence that an horrifically high number of babies survive abortion (1 in 30 from a recent survey), and that the babies immune system is sufficiently developed to suffer pain by the end of the first trimester. In one case a boy survived three attempts at being aborted!\n\nThere are extraordinary circumstances in which a baby should be allowed to be aborted, when the mother's health is at risk or the child is severely handicapped and will not survive anyway.\n\nSocial reasons are not to be placed above the suffering of another living being.",
