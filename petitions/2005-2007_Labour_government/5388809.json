        "background": "St. Patrick\u2019s cross was included when Ireland was forced to accept rule from Whitehall. 120 years of violent protest followed before Ireland was correctly handed back.\nNorthern Ireland never has been, & cannot be a separate state. Therefore the 'Union Jack' is no longer representative of the U.K, being originally a Union of TWO sovereign states.\nThis emblem of a foreign state should be removed and our ORIGINAL 'UNION FLAG' restored (this was the 'Jack' but without St. Patrick\u2019s cross), stopping other factions claiming right of inclusion and helping new immigrants understand the true nature of the UNITED KINGDOM.\nPeople of Northern Ireland think they live in Ireland, they don\u2019t. They live in an enclave of U.K. citizens in a foreign land. That is a truth, which everyone coming to the U.K.understands.\n\nThe majority of Scottish, English and new citizens don\u2019t wish to see the U.K.dissolved, but instead,consolidated properly so that it moves forward with pride and a politically correct flag!",
