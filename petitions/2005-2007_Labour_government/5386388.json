His work has been sadly overlooked by the litary world, often misunderstood.\nI believe it would a great educational aid for his work and writings to be studied at length, as they are more relevant in the modern day. His observations of both the world and the current events are thought provoking.\nPlease join me by signing this petition to improve the education of every British child.\nIn the meantime I would encourage you to seek out his works, mainly lyrics for Rush, and take time to explore their meaning.",
