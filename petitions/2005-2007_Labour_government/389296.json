Equally, Ministers (through the ministrations their numerate advisers) are able to pull the wool over the eyes of reporters when the latter lack basic numeracy, accounting and analysis skills.\n\nThis can be rectified by a simple examination, producing a star rating system to be appended to ballot papers and reporters' bylines.",
