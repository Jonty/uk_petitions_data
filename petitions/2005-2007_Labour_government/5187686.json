            "background": "It may be a beautiful and iconic aircraft but it is the leading source\nof noise disturbance over London.  It is the only widely used aircraft\nrated QC/2 on arrival - which means that it is at least two times more\nnoisy than newer widebodied jets from Boeing and Airbus.  It makes\naround four times more noise than a (shorthaul) Boeing 737-800 on\narrival.  (A full listing of departure and arrival noise ratings can\nbe found at the Department for Transport website in a PDF file called\n\"annexdqctable\".)\n\nAircraft noise has been shown to have a serious impact on the\neducation of children living and going to school beneath flightpaths.\n\n747-400s are used on many longhaul flights from the Far East, some of\nwhich arrive before 5am.\n\nWe call on the government to insist that airlines move with the times\nand use quieter aircraft on all routes using London Heathrow, thereby\nshowing respect for the millions of people affected by this blight.\n\nWe hope other airports will follow.",
