            "background": "The Media have been active in their reporting of injustices created by Family Courts at the instigation of Social Services in the unjustified removal of children for adoption from their natural parents.I believe that this is a violation of the Children's human rights causing psychological damage to them.It not only removes them from the love and care of their natural parents but their wider family and as a grandparent I have both sympathy and empathy with families caught up in this injustice.Further, there is now the spectre of children who are now or will be 18, who consider that they were wrongly removed for adoption commencing legal proceedings against local authorities.This is only the tip of the iceberg and we council tax payers will end up paying the bill.Remove this injustice now!!!",
