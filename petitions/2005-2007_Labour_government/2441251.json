Other nation's heads of government have official residences with names and so should ours. In broadcast items referring to the Prime Ministers Official Residence the whole world would know where 'Britannia House' is and know who lives and works there. When referring to the USA president\u2019s official residence correspondents have no need to refer to it as 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue Washington DC, referring to it as the 'White House' is sufficient to convey the full meaning of where the USA president lives and works.",
