            "background": "I am opposed to this recently passed law as it restricts free speech. The law is an attempt to curb what people think and reinforces the Big Brother vision George Orwell forsaw in the UK. I believe everyone should have the right to COMPLETE FREEDOM OF SPEECH. This law will curb religious freedom of speech and is a constraint on conscience. It will destroy tolerance between people of different faiths or of no faith. It will weaken religious observance in this society.",
