            "background": "I think the taxes introduced to air travel and are being banded as Enviromental taxes should not be appliciable to those who pay through a seperate scheme to offset their carbon emissions for their journeys through a carbon trading company.  Why would people who care enough about this issue have to pay twice.  If the government is going to tax them anyway and spend the money on something other than enviromental issues the traveller should have the right to choose, either pay through someone like the Carbon Trust who will offset their carbon usage for the flight, or pay at the airport when they purchase their ticket and have the money go to the government.",
