We smokers have no right or desire to make life difficult for non smokers, but we have rights as well and, with the provision of seperate rooms or efficient air conditioning there is no practical reason not to allow both in places with smoking and non smoking staff.  We particularly dislike the devisive nature of spying and fines which will further alianate otherwise law abiding citizens. A country once known for free speech and thought is fast becoming a very uncomfortable place live in and love.",
