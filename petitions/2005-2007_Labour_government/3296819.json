Get the car companies to mass produce cars to run on alternative fuels (Yes it is possible and they know it) Get all petrol stations to then provide the alternative fuel (Again it is possible) Stop this nonsense and start doing something rather than simply making more money from people who already pay tax when buying the car, tax to drive it on the road, and tax to put fuel in it. Try taking all the cars off the roads tommorow and see what effect it has on the economy.",
