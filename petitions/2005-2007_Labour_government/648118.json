            "background": "Skilled British workers are being forced out of work by immigrant workers who do not have recognised UK trade qualifications and therefore may not be working to British Standards, which are enforceable by law under the Health and Safety at Work Act. Until these immigrant workers obtain and maintain recognised UK qualifications they should only be allowed to work in an unskilled capacity. Otherwise, the requirement for British workers to qualify under Corgi, IEE, CITB etc places an unfair disadvatage on them, and the willingness of foreign workers to operate at much lower levels of pay is destroying the established living standards of indigenous British workers.",
