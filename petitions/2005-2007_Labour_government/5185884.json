        "background": "This country appears to be run by a few hundred men and Women MP's for the benefit of themselves and a few Business Collegues, appearing Quite often at odds with what is in the best Interests of the country or the wishes of the General Public.\nMost of the General public did not vote for Mass immigration, now a war with Iraq, nor the Common Market.Single Currency etc etc etc etc etc etc\n\n\nIt is my view, that the current parliamentary system is being abused, and that we live essentially in a dictatorship, whereby MP's and their business collegues ignoring public opinion can vote in Money making 'Schemes' that appear to benefit a moderately few Companies and their Parliamentary 'advisors', Often against the wishes of the public at large. \nI would like to see the public allowed to vote on day to day issues in Parliament. Specifically I feel there should be an extra 100 - 200 'electronic voters'\n in Parliamentary debates to statistically reflect the views of the General Public on the issues being discussed during debates & votes in the House of Commons.",
