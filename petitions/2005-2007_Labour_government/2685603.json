        "action": "Stop the withdrawal of the pain killer Co-Proxamol for Arthritis sufferers",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In 2005 the MRHA announced the withdrawal of Co-Proxamol, the reason for this is that if you take more than 8 or 10 and also drink a bottle of whisky or other large amounts of alcohol you could kill yourself, and some people have attempted suicide by this method. You could also try most other drugs such as paracetamol with large quantities of alcohol with the same effect. Arthritis need to take Co-Proxamol to kill some of the great pain they suffer, other drugs have many side effects and do not have the same pain killing effect of Co Proxamol. Why should people with arthritis suffer more because of a few people who may abuse the drug. My mother is 76 and has suffered with Rheumatoid Arthritis for 40 years, it is getting worse with age and now if the drug is withdrawn she will have to suffer more pain in her old age is this the act of a caring government I don't think so!",
