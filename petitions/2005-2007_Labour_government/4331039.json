        "background": "Polish Nationals have penetrated Britain in their thousands since they have become members of the EU.  Germany and France however sensibly restricted their intake.  Britain estimated the number to be only 13,000 yet current figures estimate the figure to be nearer 175,000. I am very much in favour of a multi cultural society, yet one that embraces the British Culture and not one who comes to Britain for a better way of life but ironically avoids participation in our culture. A great many Polish immigrants have language difficulties speaking little or no English at all impacting on our schools as their children are unable to communicate.  Can we not please consider restricting our intake of EU workers in favour of concentrating efforts on reducing un-employment within our own Country?",
