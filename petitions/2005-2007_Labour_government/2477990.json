            "background": "I am British, I speak many languages & have many skills that fit the criteria to work for the intelligence services to fight the terror threat in the UK. But when I apply they tell me that they won't consider me because neither of my parents are British & I didn't live here for 10 years.\nThis makes me feel as if I'm not British enough.\nI don't see why I'm not allowed to undertake such a role because I hate terrorists and wants the UK to be a safe place, like any other British person.\nI don't think there are too many people who are fluent native Arabic speakers.\nIt will be better to base the recruitment procedure on skills rather than the country of origin of the parents.\nThere is a big terrorism threat in the UK, so why exclude a lots of British people who are willing to do their bit to help this threat?\nWe're not using the potential of many intelligent, dedicated British people because I sincerely believe that people like me can contribute to the safety of this country.",
