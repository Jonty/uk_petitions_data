            "background": "We regularly read and hear complaints by militant atheists about the \"privileged\" position of the Church in society. This is despite the almost total domination of our media by the secular worldview. These people seek to silence the religious viewpoint completely and to exclude our contribution to national life and debate. In contrast to their fascisit and illiberal approach my petition does not seek to silence their voice in debate, but simply to do something positive rather than simply complain or seek to ban.",
