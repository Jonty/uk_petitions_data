        "background": "Under the Enterprise Act (2002), since 1 April 2004, a bankruptcy in England typically lasts no longer than 12 months.  Previously the discharge period would be 2 to 3 years.\n\nThis change has resulted in individual bankruptcies reaching record levels and is predicted to increase still further.\n\nThe Enterprise Act was originally intended to encourage more start-up businesses by removing the stigma of failure and also providing a regime that allows a swifter fresh start for those who have failed. In practice though the vast majority of people who benefit from the act are individuals who borrow irresponsibly to fund a lifestyle beyond their means.",
