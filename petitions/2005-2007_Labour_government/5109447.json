            "background": "Magic Mushrooms were made illegal in 2005 after which seems a knee jerk reaction to some tabloid journalism.\n\nWhen they were legal I took them many times and had no problems nor did any of my friends.\n\nAs I am not a scientist I cannot 100% say they are safe but neither can they! They made them illegal WITHOUT any research or tests. All I am asking is if they are dangerous-prove it.\n\nA lot of retailers selling this product went out of business because of which seems some negative press which I feel is unfair.\n\nPlease sign my petition, not to condone the taking of Magic Mushrooms but to protest against a decision of such costs without any real research or investigation.",
