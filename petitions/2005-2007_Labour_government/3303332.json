        "background": "I petition the government to scrap the idea of road pricing forthwith on the grounds that:-\n1    All motorised road users already pay enormous amounts into the transport fund through road tax and VAT on fuel.\n2    The cost of the infrastructure and beaurocracy to collect the new tax will be enormous.\n3    It acts as a spy in the cab of your vehicle.\n4    The present road taxation through \nthe tax disc and VAT on fuel already means the road user is already paying for road use, including congestion and pollution.\n5    More taxation on roads will lead to rising inflation as road transport costs \nwill inevitably increase.",
