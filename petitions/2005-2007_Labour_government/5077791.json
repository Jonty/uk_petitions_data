        "background": "I thought we should petition another dangerous radiation.\nThis radiation, occupying the 280-400 nanometre wavelength, is widespread. All humans are exposed on a daily basis. Exposure quantities vary with geographic location, seasonally and even occupation. These \"Chemical Rays\" as they are sometimes known and named by their discoverer Johann Willhelm Ritter, can cause severe damage to both the epidermis and dermis. Prolonged exposure has been linked to several cancers, blindness and permanent alteration of physical appearance.\nExperiments have also shown exposure to chemical rays affects growth of plants, causes damage to buildings, accelerates corrosion of ferrous materials by destruction of protective layers and causes serious burns.\nDespite the dangers, Chemical Rays are still present in every country in the world. They are used in the control of animal populations, measurement of medical data, to control quality of products, manufacture of home electronics, medical treatments and in food production to extend shelf life. Schools and workplaces are exposed to large doses on a daily basis.",
