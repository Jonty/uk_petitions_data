In our area, single mothers with samll children and shopping, needing a 2x stops only journey will be hit hard, but the most angering point is that fares have increased by approx 30%; our wages will never have the same privilage. How can Ken Livingstone say that he wants to promote the use of public transport and reduce car usage? This surely goes against his own original policy. Our area also suffers with appalling drivers, worn out seats, and bad service. Will the increase really help here?",
