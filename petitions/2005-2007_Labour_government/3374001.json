            "background": "Income Support, pension credit, income-based Jobseekers Allowance, Housing Benefit, and Council Tax Benefit all presently treat Carers Allowance as an income. Carers generally see up to \u00a326.35 each week in recognition of 35 hours of caring for a vulnerable person. In view of the savings that carers make by providing essential care to vulnerable people I ask that the Government recognise the valuable role of carers and treat Carers Allowance in the same way as Disability Living Allowance and disregard it entirely for means-tested benefits.",
