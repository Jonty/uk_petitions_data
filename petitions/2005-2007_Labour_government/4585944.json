            "background": "Having been told that North Bristol and South Gloucestershire do not require two acute hospitals and, as a consequence, we are to lose the world renowed Frenchay Hospital, we object to the proposal to introduce an independent sector surgical hospital adjacent to Frenchay, instead of Frenchay. Access to Frenchay is easy for critically injured patients from motorway accidents. This is not the case for Southmead. Help us to prevent a \u00a3100 million mistake, before it's too late!",
