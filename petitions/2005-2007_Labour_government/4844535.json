        "background": "There are so many cases that do not get the right conviction becasue lie detectors aren't used. If they were brought back to solve crime, & to make sure people are telling the truth, this would solve many problems in many cases. It would also ensure that some cases aren't brought to court, & that cases, which should be brought to court are. Sometimes relying on evidence is not enough, or sometimes it is difficult to get evidence, this should rectify this problem, so the police can't just throw cases away, they will have to investigete fully, including getting lie detectors done if that will help with a case that is reported.",
