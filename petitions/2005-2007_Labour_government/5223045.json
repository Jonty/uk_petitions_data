            "background": "The production of foie gras involves force feeding ducks and geese by ramming a tube down their throats and pouring up to 4lbs of grain into the tubes.  It is a barbaric and sickening practice, and the pipes puncture many birds' throats, sometimes causing them to bleed to death or suffer painful wounds.  Please help to stop this vicious and cruel practice now by signing this petition.",
