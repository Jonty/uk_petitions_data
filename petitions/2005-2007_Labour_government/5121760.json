            "background": "The price of bread is extortionate with most brands/styles over the \u00a31 mark and some up to \u00a31.50. For an 'every day' cornerstone of the nation's diet for fibre, it is too high a cost to pay for a food which should be readily attainable for all, at no significant cost.\n\nWe propose that the government impose a price cap on bread. The upper limit should be no more than 40p.",
