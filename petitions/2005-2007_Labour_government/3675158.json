            "background": "There seems to be a growing trend in the use of Chinese Lanterns, which are basicaly balloon like structures that carry a flame of sorts. Many people are buying these and releasing them over towns, cities and in the Countryside.\n\nThey should be banned, as a matter of health and safety.  If one was to land on a barn full of hay bales, or in a field of crops, or even worse in a thatched cottage, well you don't have to imagine what could happen there.  Why the Fire Authorities in the UK have not raised the issue is a puzzle.  They must be banned before someone gets seriously hurt. This is not being a kill joy, this is a serious matter of health and safety to life and property.",
