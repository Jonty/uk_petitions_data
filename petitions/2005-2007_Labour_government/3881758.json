            "background": "My brother has just been diagnosed with this cancer and is now undergoing treatment at Barts.  There is no cure - There is one drug that is working miracles abroad but naturally UK can't afford it.  Barts have now stated that we are at the start of an epidemic with asbestos related lung disease. Research for a cure must be ongoing - the average life expectancy is 12-18 months after diagnosing.  Major companies were still using asbestos up until 1999.    This devastating disease will I am sure affect each family in the UK by 2020.\nI wouldn't wish on my worst enemy what my poor brother is now having to endure.  All he did was work to keep his family.  He is 50 years old and will never see the retirement with his family that he was so looking forward to and entitled to.",
