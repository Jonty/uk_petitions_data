            "background": "I am petitioning the Prime Minister to help people trying to start their life.\nQuite a lot of my friends, including myself have been suffering over the past 3 years due to easily accessible money.  At 18 I was able to get a \u00a35k loan in 30mins without issue, and others I know a lot more, now we struggle due to the lack of advice and help from the bank and the government to repay our debts.  I know quite a few people with their lives falling to pieces due to money issues, trying to pay the high house prices, taxes, bills and everything else the government throws at us including the new road tax you are thinking of implicating, therefore claiming bankruptcy, with myself not far behind.\nGive out better advise and more help to those who are trying to start life on the right foot, everything is soo expensive for people my age to get a good start in life, make up for past mistakes and still trying to afford a home.  Too many are falling short with this and have nowhere to go.",
