        "background": "as shown on the news today (26th february 2007) the japanesse goverment is whale and dolphin hunting on a massive scale and its our duty to stop such cruelty to these beautiful and harmless creatures.Many of our holiday companies such as Thompsons are indirectly supporting this cruel activity by advertising swimming with whales and dolphins and other sealife centres buying these animals ,with this money they are investing into further cruelty.We often buy goods from Japan but how can we justify supporting a goverment and its economy which practises this.Most species on this planet kills through a need to survive,we are the only species that kills for pleasure and profit.I'm not an animal extremist but watching this on the news as caused me great distress and sadness that we can just watch this happen and do nothing,so please sign up and highlight this further.",
