            "background": "The first series of the BBC drama was a hit show featuring character such as Ashika Chandiramani (Shelley Conn) and Scott Foster (Andrew Buchan). Whilst the incredible amount of drug taking and sex was a little bit ridiculous, to many of those working in the Houses of Parliament this was all that we had going in our lives. Sadly the BBC are not currently planning to create a second series which has caused deep distress for many people. The BBC receive our license fees and should give the people what they want and the people want a second series of Party Animals. The Prime Minister could create his legacy if he were to pressurise the BBC into creating a second series of Party Animals",
