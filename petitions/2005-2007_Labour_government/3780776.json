            "background": "I have become more and more appalled by the use of hard working taxpayers \nmoney and the unbelievable laws that are passed now a days.\nThe laws of this country do nothing but tie the hands of the police, put the \nvictims in even more of a vulnerable state and protect the criminals. Stop \nworrying about criminals\u2019 rights and start thinking about the law abiding \npeople of this country. Criminals shouldn't have human rights, the day they \ndecided to act against their fellow man they give up their human rights.\nLet\u2019s stop using taxes to look after prisoners and start using it to protect \nthe innocent; I am especially thinking of the children. More needs to be \ndone to protect the children and more needs to be done to stop child sex \npolitician trades. \nIt's time to stop looking the other way and start protecting the children, \nnot the criminals.",
