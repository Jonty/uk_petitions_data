        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Again motorists are being used as soft targets to raise revenue, high fuel costs, levies on 4x4\u2019s, extortionate road fund tax, proposed road charging and now a \u00a315 surcharge on top of fixed penalty fines . How many more hidden taxes can this money grabbing government squeeze out of the motorist. Is this cash to be used to improve infrastructure? Or make our roads safer? NO.\nThe \u00a315 levy will be imposed on anyone who faces a fine, including drivers who challenge a speeding ticket in court. The cash will be used to appoint dozens of domestic violence counsellors to help bring alleged cases of abuse to court. Whilst every one who signs this petition will have the utmost sympathy for the victims of violence; this revenue should be raised from the people who commit violent crime whether domestic or otherwise",
