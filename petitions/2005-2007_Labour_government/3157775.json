            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Basically in order to reduce carbon emissions/road building/over crowded transport and so on we need to encourage employers to have more employees working from home.  With the rise in broadband usage working from home is an increasingly viable option.  This could be done two ways - reduce employers NI liability - however this will be a dent in revenue (both for NI and car tax and fuel vat) - or increase it for those employees who could work from home but dont (we have to exclude factory workers etc).  Either way Employers would be quick to initiate such policies as they will benefit from encouraging this.  With regard to insurance and health and safety employees will need to sign a waiver so that the employer is not liable for their home workplace (in case of accidents etc).",
