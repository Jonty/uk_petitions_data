It is an attempt to ignore -and, indeed, suppress- the capabilities of a new piece of technology by forcing users to adhere to what used to be done before that technology was introduced.",

After much discussion, we have decided not to add this function.\nThe rationale is this: \"e-petitions\" is designed essentially as a modern equivalent of the traditional petitions presented at the door of No.10. It enables people to put their views to the Prime Minister. It is not intended to be a form of quasi-referendum or unrepresentative opinion poll (professional polls use special techniques to ensure balanced samples). With a \"vote against\" function, that is what it would effectively become.\nIt is of course possible to create a counter-petition to an existing campaign (as many people already have). This remains the best option if you disagree with a particular petition.",
