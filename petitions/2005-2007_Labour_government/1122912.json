It is an attempt to ignore -and, indeed, suppress- the capabilities of a new piece of technology by forcing users to adhere to what used to be done before that technology was introduced.",

            "details": "Many people have suggested changes to the e-petitions service during this test phase, and a number of improvements have been made as a result.\nOne of the most popular proposals has been the creation of a 'sign against' mechanism, which would allow users to disagree with petitions. After much discussion, we have decided not to add this function.\nThe rationale is this: \"e-petitions\" is designed essentially as a modern equivalent of the traditional petitions presented at the door of No.10. It enables people to put their views to the Prime Minister. It is not intended to be a form of quasi-referendum or unrepresentative opinion poll (professional polls use special techniques to ensure balanced samples). With a \"vote against\" function, that is what it would effectively become.\nIt is of course possible to create a counter-petition to an existing campaign (as many people already have). This remains the best option if you disagree with a particular petition.",
