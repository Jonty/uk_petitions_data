            "background": "The prime minister has recently stated that \"every minute of every day a child is killed or seriously injured on the world's roads\", why then in the UK are some consumers being priced out of buying high visability garments, which save countless lives on our roads, by the existance of VAT on these products. The sole purpose of these garments is to save lives, and therefore I think it is only right that something should be done by the government to make them more accessable to ordinary people.",
