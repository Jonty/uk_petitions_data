            "background": "As the debate on Britishness and our national identity rages on, I believe it is time to fly or display more British flags in Schools and Government Buildings, such as town halls.\n\nOur children increasingly only see flags when there is a football match on which means they might not even see the Great British flag, flying it in schools for them to see will teach them to respect and honour this great nation and help their national identity.\n\nAs the nation continues through tough times and struggles, we rarely see our flag to give us hope and inspiration for the future of the country.\nWhen we do see the flag in our local area, it is usually on a private building, hung by a private citizen or company who, unlike our government, is not afraid to fly the flag of this great nation.\n\nI ask more money is spent on placing flags in Schools and on Government Buildings.\nHow can we not be flying our flag from every public building? Hiding our patriotism and love of the country didn't make us the great nation that we are today and it certainly doesn't make us any more British or help our national identity.",
