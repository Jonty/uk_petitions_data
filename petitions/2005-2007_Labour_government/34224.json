General Elections have been won with less than 1/3 of the votes.\n\nIn European Elections there is a system called Proportional Representation. This system allows the parties to create a list of the people who they would like to be elected. Once the results are in the number of seats won by each party is based on the percentage of the vote. So, if a party has 5% of the vote they will get 5% of the seats in that election.\n\nThis system would give a voice to the smaller parties and would enable supporters of those parties to be represented.",
