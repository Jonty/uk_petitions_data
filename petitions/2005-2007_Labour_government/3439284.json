The book had a big influence on the English language with such phrases as \"Big Brother is Watching You\"; he invented the NewSpeak language of which \"double plus unthink\" is a typical example. Many of the ideas central to his book have come to pass and who knows what will be next to become true. Even this petition site is no more than the wall the Proles wrote on to let off steam.",
