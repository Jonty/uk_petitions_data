            "background": "A ban on legally held, licensed pistols was brought into force in 1997, in an effort to try and reduce crime committed using pistols. This ban, however good its intentions, have completely failed, as crime involving pistols has continued to rise at the same rate as before the ban. All the ban has achieved is stop law-abiding citizens and Olympic athletes from participating in a popular sport, and has done nothing to stop the criminal element from arming themselves, as criminals buy them from the black market, and never from legal sources.\n\nThe ban is not only unfair, but has also completely failed in its stated goals, and we call for it to be repealed.",
