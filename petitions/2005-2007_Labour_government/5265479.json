        "background": "Last week a 3 year old girl (in South Africa ) was beaten and raped. \nThe man responsible was released on bail yesterday. He is walking the streets. If you are too busy to read this then just sign your name and forward this on. \nThe Government is planning to close the child protection unit and this is a petition against it. This is a very important petition. It is an essential part of the justice system for children.\n \nYou may have already heard that there's a myth in South Africa that  having sex with a virgin will cure AIDS. The younger the virgin, the more potent the cure. This has led to an epidemic of rapes by infected males, with the correspondent infection of innocent kids. Many have died in these cruel rapes. Recently in Cape Town , a 9-month-old baby was raped by 6 men looking for a cure.  It will continue if someone doesn't stop.",
