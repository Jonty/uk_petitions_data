Road traffic is the single biggest contributor to our carbon emissions; congestion costs the country\u2019s economy \u00a311-20bn per year and is responsible for more than 3,000 fatalities and  270,000 injuries every year.\n\nWe urge the government to consider all options for reducing congestion, including Road User Charging, which has already been a success through the London Congestion Charge. We believe that for any scheme to be successful it must involve significant new investment in public transport whilst protecting individual\u2019s privacy and civil liberties.",
