It resembles five jagged pink pieces, which in the words of Sebastian Coe, \"will define the venues we build and the Games we hold and act as a reminder of our promise to use the Olympic spirit to inspire everyone and reach out to young people around the world.\" \n\nComments on a BBC forum on the logo have ranged from \"a mess\" to \"looks just like a window I recently kicked a ball through.\"\n\nAs a logo that will in part represent Britain for the next five years and will receive increasing scrutiny as 1012 approaches, we urge the Prime Minister to request the organising committee to reconsider the logo's design.",
