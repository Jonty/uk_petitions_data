Do not let this wonderful vox populis (E-Petions) allow the Great British  opposition to Capital Punishment (an essential tenant, that leads the world in human rights understanding and good law making) be undermined by ignorance. Though the E-petition is a wonderful place to let our voices be heard never forget we are one of the most liberal and safe countries in the world. Vote thoughtfully and vote for the person not the party.",
