        "background": "Apparently the thinking behind bus lanes is to get people out of there cars & onto public transport, how does this work for trucks? We have to be there delivering the goods that keep the country going. All bus lanes do is keep trucks in the same traffic jams as the one person in one car that there supposed to prevent. Can you imagine the amount of fuel this wastes & the amount of money it costs the country.",
