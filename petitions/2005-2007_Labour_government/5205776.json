            "background": "The official logo for the London 2012 Olympic Games is an embarrassment to London, to the UK and to the taxpayers who funded its creation.  It is old-fashioned and expressionless.  A logo for London games should emphasise all we love about modern Britain - our technological edge, our multiculturalism as well as honour our love of tradition.  This logo does none of these, and will project a very negative image of Britain to the international Olympic community.\n\nThe logo used for the games' bid - with a stylised River Thames - was modern, clean and stylish, and more than adequate for the task.  Therefore, the Games should adopt it as the official logo.",
