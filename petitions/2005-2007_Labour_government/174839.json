        "action": "punish nuisance drug and alcohol abusers more strictly by writing stricter breadth and power into the Mental Health Act",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is intended to drive the government to press for legislation that will have the building or use of existing facilities as asylums or institutions for drug abusers to be incarcerated in and also to improve the powers of the Mental Health Act. Abuse must be more clearly defined and controlled and we the undersigned believe the policy would have far reaching effects upon the economy, foreign policy, society, and would improve Britain\u2019s Government\u2019s status in the minds of foreigners. We believe some of the long-term achievements will be a greater intake into the medical professions, improved results in education, a greater employment statistic. We believe it will be good for the economy and for energy policy. We believe it would help to give our Isles more of the same status and respect we once enjoyed.",
