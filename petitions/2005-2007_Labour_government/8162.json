        "background": "Change stamp duty so when the value of a property hits the duty level its only the amount above that limit that is charged at the higher rate. E.g. a property worth \u00a3300,000  would get charged nothing for 0-120,000 1% of 120,000 - 250,000 and 2.5% of 250,000 - 300,000.\n\nThis would stop prices bunching around stamp duty levels and allow buyers to more easily put in offers just above stamp duty limits.\n\nI would imagine stamp duty percentages would need to increase in order to keep duty raised for a property about the same value as today.",
