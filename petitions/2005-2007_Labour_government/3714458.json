        "background": "If any person commits a serious crime against the person such as drug importing/supply, sexual slavery, sexual offences against children; then an act should be passed to remove their right to be considered human. This would  nullify any protection under EU/UK human rights legislation, they could then be punished in a more final effective form, freeing organs for transplant to those in need. \n\nIf judges refuse to proceed then an act similar to the now defunct Act (or Bill) of Attainder could be re activated as required then Parliament could try the most serious offenders directly with no appeal or reversalof sentence say in a \"Star Chamber\" or alike.",
