            "background": "Recently, many Internet Service Providers (ISPs) have been using Traffic Shaping to limit the download/upload speed of internet users when a maximum download figure is breached. This has had the effect of slowing internet services to a crawl for many users, who pay expensive monthly subscriptions for an adequate, dependable service. If you are against such measures, and want ISPs to properly invest in their networks, then sign up to this petition.",
