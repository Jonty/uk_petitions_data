Unless your phone is small, it will not fit, and i would like to see action taken by the manufacturer to rememdy this for the benefit of the British people, to whom be glory.\n\nWhilst i recognise that this is not a matter for parliamentary consideration, i hope this petitions existance and popularity will spur the fashion industry to make better the woeful situation that people with larger mobiles find themselves in.  \n\nIf the companies do not do this through guilt and wish to be seen in good will, i hope they make the pockets bigger out of the desire to be competitive; the company that follows this will have more customers.\n\nThere is more than convenience to this idea; if people's phones are well in these pockets, they are less likely to suffer pickpocketing and they would be less likely to suffer damage as they are in a tighter place, where the phone would be safe.",
