            "background": "It is unreasonable and unfair to charge staff, patients and day\nvisitors for parking at hospitals. Hospitals cannot legitimately justify this practice when attendance is not a matter of choice but rather medical need. The practice of charging health workers for parking is equally disagreeable and this should be a hospital running cost. I would ask the government to step in and do the RIGHT thing. Stop charging for parking at hospitals.",
