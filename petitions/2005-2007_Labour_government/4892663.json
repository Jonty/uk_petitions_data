            "background": "Build a bypass for Braunton to prevent the long delays in and out of the village due to it being the only major route to Croyde, Saunton and Ilfracombe. It is a major route used by tourists which causes much of the congestion in summer months. A bypass will handle the traffic better and remove it from the village's struggling roads.",
