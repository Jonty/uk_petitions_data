            "background": "There is great injustice and suffering to the people of England and of Wales by the refusal to allow certain proven medicines to be avaialble in those countries when those same medicines have already been approved in Scotland.\nLicensed medicines have a rigorous approval system already by the UK Dept of Health for Efficacy, Safety & Quality & then to deny those medicines to English/Welsh patients whilst allowing them to Scottish patients is a monumental Injustice.   It is caused by using the process of approval by \" NICE \" to slow-down and even block the use of new Medicines.  In Scotland, only the proper licensing of the Medicine appears to govern its introduction.",
