            "action": "introduce legislation to amend the BBC\u2019s charter so that it is no longer allowed to provide any news output whatsoever, in view of its demonstrable lack of objectivity and professionalism as shown in its news reporting by (i) its bias in favour of the EU at the expense of British parliamentary democracy, (ii) its favouring of any other nation than England and any other people than the English people.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The case against the BBC's News reporting: (i) The BBC does not report that many important areas of government policy are competencies of the EU (such as trade or the environment); that some two-thirds of UK laws and regulations originate in Brussels, are subject to very limited British influence and that the role of the Westminster Parliament is simply to enact them. (ii) The BBC website news on England is mainly about crime. Compare this with the BBC coverage of the other home nations, which also have their own politics section.  There is no BBC Radio England, but there is BBC Radio Scotland etc.  BBC newscasters do not show any respect for St George\u2019s Day.  The BBC is in favour of devolution for all but the English.  The BBC appears to over promote staff from Scotland and Ireland, and under promote English people.  In sum, the public pays for an unfair, partial and inaccurate news service through the licence fee.  Is it healthy for our democracy that such huge public funds should be provided to what is an essentially monopolistic and unaccountable body?  The BBC either does not, or cannot, provide impartial news coverage.  It therefore has no legitimate call on public funds.",
