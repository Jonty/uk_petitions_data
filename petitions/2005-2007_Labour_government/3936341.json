            "background": "I feel that some stores, supermarkets, DIY stores etc do not do enough to stop the sales of fireworks to people who are not using them for their intended purpose, i.e bonfire night, celebrations and religous festivals. These outlets are only interested in the 'SALE' regardless of their use. Specialist suppliers would be better suited to stop the sale of fireworks to people using them for nuisance. Thus making things safer for people and also ensuring those who like to celebrate with fireworks can continue to do so.",
