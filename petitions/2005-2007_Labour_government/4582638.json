            "background": "Income tax is an antiquated tax that has little relevance in the modern world. It would be better to give all current tax payers all their money but tax them when they use their money and thus enable taxation to promote greener services and products.\n\nIt would, of course, mean rises in sales taxes but people then have the option of whether they wish to purchase those items or not and green-friednly products and services would be zero rated.\n\nThis would also have the advantage of eliminating the fraud and dishonesty associated with tax returns and remove this heavy burden from tax payers.",
