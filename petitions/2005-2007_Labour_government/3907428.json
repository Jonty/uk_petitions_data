The developer or investor has the money to out bid the first time buyer, and as a result the prices are now too high for many first time buyers. I know of one investor who out bid a young couple for a house, and this person has over sixty houses on the rental market.In many countries, investors are only alowed to purchase the mid to high end property allowing the low end market available to local people and first time buyers giving them a chance to get on the property ladder.",
