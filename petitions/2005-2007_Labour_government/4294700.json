        "background": "When Prime Minister John Major forced the Treaty of Maastricht through Parliament, which was enacted in 1993, all the people of the British Isles had an extra nationality foisted upon them.  Unbeknown to most, from that moment on, all British subjects were not only classed as British citizens, but also European citizens too which also came with obligations and duties to the European Union.  As not one British citizen asked for, or were given the opportunity to vote for or against this extra tier of nationality, we demand that the British Government gives the British people the right to renounce European citizenship and are freed from any duties and laws the European Union makes.",
