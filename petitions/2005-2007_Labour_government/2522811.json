The DWP, Housing Benefit, Income Support, Inland Revenue etc. each take their own cut and these deductions actually mean the disabled are worse off as each department does not take into account the deductions made other departments.\n\nI propose the whole system for income allowances be re-organised to make it fairer for the most deprived in the employment world.",
