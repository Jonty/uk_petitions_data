            "background": "Contractual work is essential in this country and the risks involved to the contractor are considerably higher then permanent staff due to unpaid sick leave, lack of insurance cover, short termination periods and lack of job security so a reversal of the Managed Limited Company rule is required. \n\nThe only benefit of Contracting was the benefit of less tax and NI to offset these risks which has now been removed. The government should not clamp down on people who want to work hard in this country and who provide essential services, we already pay corporation tax, tax, VAT and NI. Forcing contractors down the PAYE route will only increase the amount of people leaving this type of employment which is negative for the employment figures and economy.",
