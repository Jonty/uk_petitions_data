            "background": "If a person or organisation causes loss or injury to others through negligence or even as a result of an accident, they can be sued for compensation.  It is perverse that if loss or injury is caused by a deliberate malicious act, the perpetrator is immune from the requirement to compensate the victim(s). \nIf convicts were automatically made to compensate their victims, it would provide relief to their victims as well as deterring crime.\nCompensation should cover the replacement of stolen or damaged property, and the upkeep of any dependents of a murder victim for as long as necessary.  If the criminal lacks sufficient capital, they should be forced to take out a loan at commercial interest rates.\nWe should also consider billing criminals for the cost of the investigation that led to their conviction, and for the cost of their upkeep during any gaol term. \nParents should be responsible for the actions of criminals below the age of criminal responsibility.",
