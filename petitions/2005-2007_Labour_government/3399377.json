        "background": "The UK is one of the few places in the world where current accounts are still free.  As the Office of Fair Trading starts to crack down on excessive charges for current accounts and credit cards - the backlash is that banks are finding other ways to profit and will introduce monthly charges for everyone to have an account.\nFree banking should remain for \"good\" bank customers who do not have / need overdrafts.\nWE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO HAVE A BANK ACCOUNT. We give the banks our money every month and they make massive profits so how can they now say that they think its fair that we all pay to get access to our own money???",
