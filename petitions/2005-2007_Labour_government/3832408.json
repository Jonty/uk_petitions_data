        "background": "MTAS is seriously flawed.\n\nSome of the most gifted trainee doctors of their generation have been not been shortlisted for jobs within the NHS, which is in effect a monopoly employer. These doctors, who have each cost the UK taxpayer an estimated \u00a3250,000 will have no choice other than either a change of career or to leave the country to seek medical employment overseas. \n\nFurthermore, the system discriminates against the thousands of skilled doctors who have legitimately come to the UK from overseas to fill gaps and provide service within the NHS. \n\nThe Academy of Royal Colleges, British Medical Association and senior doctors within the NHS do not have confidence in the application process due to computer failures and serious procedural flaws.",
