            "background": "We have a young daughter, currently in primary school, who has sensitive skin and is prone to burning when exposed to sun-light.  As responsible parents we purchased some sun cream for our daughter which we left in her school bag.  She is more than capable of applying the cream herself, having being made well aware of the dangers she faces.  We made it clear to her that she should apply the cream when playing outside during playtime.  She recently came home from school looking very hot and flustered and clearly very ill.  We eventually found out that her head mistress had banned her from using her sun cream (but had not made the effort to tell us).\nWe believe that a school headmistress with no medical training should not be allowed to expose children in her care to ultra-violet radiation against the wishes of parents.\nWe therefore believe that persons responsible for young children should be made to undertake medical training and be made aware of the dangers involved.",
