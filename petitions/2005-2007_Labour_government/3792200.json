            "background": "Humanist weddings should be legally recognised in England & Wales.\n\nUnder European legislation, humanists have been discriminated against by not being able to have legally-binding marriage ceremonies. \n\nUK legislation requires us to interpret the British law, in a way that is consistent with the European Convention on Human Rights. \n\nThe Prince of Wales used that argument to put beyond doubt the fact that it was okay for him to have a civil marriage and Humanists are using this as the premise on which to put beyond doubt that humanists should be permitted to be legally wed. \n\nHumanist weddings are legally recognised in Scotland and The Registrar General for Scotland has authorised 12 registered humanist celebrants to conduct legal marriages. \n\nThe time is right for the Scottish ruling to be recognised in England and Wales.",
