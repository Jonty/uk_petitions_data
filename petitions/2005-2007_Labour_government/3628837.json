            "background": "To put a stop to mass immagration under the guise as \"its good for the economy\" if labour got british people of benefits and got them working then we would have no need for mass immagration, housing, nhs,social services, transport wouldnt be in crisis as there wounldnt be so many people in this counrty. Labour have let so many people into this counrty that our services cant cope so the best idea is to stop it all together and get the majority of labour voters of the dole and into work.",
