        "background": "How many times have you been stuck in a queue of traffic behind an HGV travelling at 45mph on a 60mph road, or worse still, a tractor? How many times have you seen the impatience of people just trying to get to work and back home, carry out crazy manoeuvres to overtake the said vehicle/s? If the traffic were allowed to flow freely, surely there would be a decrease in car accidents.",
