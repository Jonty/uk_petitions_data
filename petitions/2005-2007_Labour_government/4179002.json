            "background": "This law should be increased to more than just a maximum of a driving ban and a limited fine. We are talking about lives here! How many more people have to die because drivers are getting off too lightly through careless driving??? How many more families have to suffer their loss and suffer more because they don't think justice has been done for their loved ones??? My fiance was killed in August 2006 and the defendant got a 2yr driving ban with a 500 Pound fine.Not much for taking a life and devastating other lives. With an appeal ongoing against the sentence. I don't think drivers should be allowed to appeal for taking a life or if appeals are made it should be a guaranteed increased of sentence. I think this law should come under the same catergory as dangerous driving.",
