        "background": "Political correctness is disgusting.\n\nInstitutional political correctness is the collective effort of an organisation to deny free speech and to \nmarginalize certain words, phrases, actions or attitudes through the instrumentation of public disesteem\n\nExamples: Christmas rebranded winterval in case it offends.\n\nBanning religious symbols like a crucifix in case it offends.\n\nPeople warned not to have England flags during the World Cup, in case it offends.\n\nNo birthday cards making fun of your age, in case it offends\n\nPointless litigation - prisoners being given public money because they were not allowed to vote\n\nMinorities demanding (and getting) their own way because they claim to be \"offended\" even though no actual hurt was intended or caused.\n\nTime to end the compensation culture and never hear again the phrase \"It's political correctness GONE MAD\"",
