        "background": "A recent petition to abolish the planned road pricing schemes had (by 14th Feb) over 1.4 million signatures which is a considerable number of people and one which cannot be ignored by the government.\n\nHowever I believe that there are an equal, if not many more, number of people who would be prepared to have road pricing if there were cheap, efficient and green public transport alternatives to cars.\n\nAny road pricing scheme has to be in conjunction with new and substantial investment into public transport.",
