            "background": "Under current Mental Health legislation people can have \"treatment\" forced on them while they are in hospital.  The new Mental Health Bill proposes to extend this to include people living peaceably in the community. The vast majority of people treated under the Mental Health Act do not pose any threat to others.\n\nThe drugs commonly forced on people under the Act have serious adverse effects which even the drug companies admit, and are often found completely unhelpful by the people prescribed them.  People are also still given ECT, often against their expressed wishes.\n\nMental health diagnoses such as \"schizophrenia\" are of questionable scientific validity.  Many respected psychologists dispute the existence of such \"mental illnesses\".  There is no objective scientific test for any \"mental illness\", such as a blood test.\n\nPeople diagnosed with \"mental illnesses\" should have the same rights as those with physical illnesses to refuse any specific treatment or all treatment.",
