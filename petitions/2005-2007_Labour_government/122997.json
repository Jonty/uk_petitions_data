            "background": "Desert Island Discs is one of Radio 4's most popular and enduring programmes. Created by Roy Plomley in 1942, the format is simple: each week a guest is invited by Kirsty Young to choose the eight records they would take with them to a desert island.\n\nSince the BBC has been offering the \"Listen Again\" feature on their website one can listen to any of their shows at any time during the 7 days after the show was aired.  That is, one can listen to all of the shows, other than Desert Island Discs.  The bemusing paradox about this situation is that Desert Island Discs is one of their most popular programmes and many people simply cannot listen to it at the times that it is aired.\n\nWe wish to petition the Prime Minister to lead discussions with the owner of the rights for the program, to come to a solution by which people can listen again to the show.",
