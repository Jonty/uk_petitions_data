        "background": "The Home Office now insists that all non EEC immigrants must pass the Life in the UK test or reach level three ESOL standard in English.This seems to be a perfectly reasonable requirement for all NEW applications for settlment in the UK.However no requirement was indicated when settlment was applied for more than 2 years ago.The Government has now moved the 'goalposts' which is grossly unfair, requiring migrants to pay hundreds of pounds more in order to remain legally in the uk until they can reach the English standard or pass the test.This also discrimiates against NON EEC Nationals as migrants from the EEC who are not required to have this additional Qualification.",
