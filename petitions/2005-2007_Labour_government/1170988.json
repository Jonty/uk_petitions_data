        "action": "extend the Distance Selling Regulations to require a telephone point of contact",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A number of companies selling by mail order currently rely on e-mail as a primary method of contact and support. It is my belief that this is a cost-cutting measure which ultimately impacts on the customer who may have to wait hours, or even days, to receive what often turns out to be a placeholder reply to their enquiry. This is highly inconvinient, especially if the order is particularly important or of a high value.\n\nWhile I understand that there are plenty of alternative options (some of which will offer telephone support) in a competitive marketplace, some niches are filled or dominated by only one or two companies leaving you with no choice but to order and hope they reply to an e-mail when sent.\n\nI am petitioning for the extension of the Distance Selling Regulations to state that any company selling goods or services by mail order or over the Internet MUST be contactable by phone in order to discuss enquiries.",
