            "background": "The US has a Can-SPAM Act which goes a long way to protects its citizens from SPAM. We have the ability in the UK to do the same, by forcing those who send SPAM to clearly show who they are and where the SPAM e-mail has originated from. If your e-mail address is hijacked and used to send SPAM, it can devastate your business's reputation - we need laws which prevent this and heavy penalties for those who infringe the law. We need to regulate SPAM e-mail in the same way that we regulate unwanted commercial faxes (FPS) and telephone calls (TPS), so that we don't paralyse UK businesses and individuals with unwanted email. Legislation which places a legal obligation on the ISP's to give you the option of blocking SPAM from certain countries will reduce the amount of SPAM we receive dramatically, and free up our e-mail highways - great for individuals, great for legitimate businesses and great for the ISP's who must be suffering under the strain of all the unwanted e-mails which are distributed!",
