        "background": "During the weekends up to 70% of the beds in casualty departments are taken by drunks. These people are not \u2018ill\u2019 or \u2018injured\u2019 but take up a massive resource. Each major Town and City should have a facility where the Ambulance & Police can take drunks, which does not impact on A&E\u2019s.\n\nIn this facility they could be looked after by a Nurse or Paramedic, on becoming sober they could be fed. A police officer would be present to keep the peace and serve a Fixed Penalty Notice for drunkenness, fixed at a level to make the scheme self funding.  In any case it would be cheaper than taking up casualty beds.",
