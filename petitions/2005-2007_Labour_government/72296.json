            "background": "I feel that at 14, citizens should be allowed the right to vote, should they wish to. I feel that, despite being an obviously arbitrary delimiter and maybe crass generalisation, a number of young people, including myself, request the ability to vote. I personally have very strong beliefs about how this country should be run and who by, and I feel these are being neglected due to my age. The ability to vote at 14 years of age should increase the suitability of the eventually chosen government to make correct decisions concerning younger people and urge governments in place to do so, so as not to lose a portion of their possible supporters.\n\nI believe it is time to stop ignoring the views of four years' worth of the population.",
