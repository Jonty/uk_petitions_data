This would cut down on persistent reoffending, give them a purpose and possibly a career,  discipline them, hopefully make this current yob culture a thing of the past and in this way they would really be paying their debt to society. In turn this would stop future over-crowding of our prisons and stop such a waste of tax payer's money.",
