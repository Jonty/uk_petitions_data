        "background": "Positive discrimination ignores educational and personal qualifications to carry out a duty. Any particular specification to enable special treatment according to race or creed is sex or race discrimination. Positive discrimination in any case contradicts democracy. It often also achieves exactly the opposite as it creates jealousy and hatred as ignored persons feel discriminated against. Positive discrimination can be abused to create a majority within any group or company to install enough persons to gain a majority for policies therefore not allowing opposition views to be heard. Without exception educational and personal qualifications should be used to determine suitability for any post. Rather then prefer by race or creed, more should be done to educate those being underrepresented and enable them to achieve true competitiveness. If any race or creed, religion etc is underrepresented then more should be done to educate those to encourage them to participate without avoiding democratic processes.",
