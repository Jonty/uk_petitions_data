        "background": "The HSE approaches the problem of risk in the forestry industry by trying to make the industry 'fool-proof' by over-tight regulation. Unfortunately the industry is, by nature, frought with risk such that this strategy will not and cannot ever work. The cost to the field practitioner of this approach is inconvenience, inefficiency, frustration, stress and additional risks that were not there before. I suggest it would be wiser to avoid 'fools' entering the industry in the first place, by tightening recruitment qualifications, improving the quality of formal training and ensuring trainees receive quality 'on-the-job' coaching and supervision for the furtherance of improvement.",
