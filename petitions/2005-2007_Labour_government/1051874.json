The responses are full of excuses and flowery words which amount to the same attitude - we do not care and are not willing to take action.  \n\nPlease look into actioning the issues that law abiding have taken time to bring to your attention. Each response so far has amounted to nothing but let downs which in turn lessens everyones trust, respect and faith in the petitions system.",
