            "background": "Caravans cause ciaos on A roads, create traffic jams throughout the South coast in the summertime and clog up the motorway network. I propose that caravans are banned by the year 2020.  Other petitions asking for a restriction in the time a caravan can be towed do not go far enough as far as I am concerned.   I implore the UK public to support this proposal.",
