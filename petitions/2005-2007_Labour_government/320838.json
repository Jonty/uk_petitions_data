            "background": "Recent events have brought the fact that dogs, although they can on one hand be loving companions, can get vicious. This can be due to the dogs breed, but a lot of the time due to improper training. I think that compulsary 8 weeks puppy training on reciept of the dog and after their initial vaccinations, will lower the chance that they will grow up into vicious dogs, and even save lives.",
