            "background": "These crude devices inflict terrible cruelty and suffering on any animals unlucky enough to be trapped in them. They are totally indiscriminate and often catch protected animals, such as badgers and otters, as well as domestic pets and livestock.\nSnares are thin wire garrottes commonly used by gamekeepers to catch the foxes that are naturally drawn to the artificially elevated numbers of game birds in shooting woods. Snares are also set to catch rabbits. \nSnares are barbaric and the UK should join the many other European countries that have banned their manufacture and use.",
