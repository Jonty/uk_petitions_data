        "background": "There's no point just taxing 4x4 owners, when lorries for horses, sports cars in particular or large fuel consumers do the real damage. A 4x4 does not mean high CO2, for example a small diesel or small 4x4 will emit the same as a standard petrol car. The real issue is the environment, why not tax based on the damage to the environment only and include all big emitters?",
