What Bianca would like is for the law to be changed so that all of childrens clothing, not just nighties and dressing gowns to be made safe and flame resistant so that no other child has to go through what she has endured over the last two years.  Furniture has to be made flame resistent for safety, shouldn't our children be allowed this as well for their safety.",
