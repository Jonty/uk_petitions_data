            "background": "Drug addicts choose to become drug addicts.  They could just as easily choose not to become drug addicts.  Making it possible for them to access taxpayer funded medication and treatment just goes to make it much easier for them to make the choice.  Taxpayers who are not drug addicts are therefore subsidising the habits of drug addicts through the taxes they pay.  This, at the very least, is immoral use of taxpayers payments and, at worst, is against the law which states that one person should not assist another in their use of illegal drugs - an offence punishable with incarceration.",
