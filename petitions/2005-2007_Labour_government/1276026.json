            "background": "NAGTY (the National Academy for Gifted and Talented Youth) has been a hugely successful organisation providing support and organising hugely beneficial activities for gifted and talented students throughout England. The Government has refused to renew its contract, instead replacing it with a consultancy based service which is likely to provide significantly less direct support for students. The dissolution of NAGTY will severely affect the quality of life, enjoyment in education and future prospects of the thousands of its members.",
