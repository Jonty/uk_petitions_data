            "background": "How can any world leader, country or electorate take a Prime Minister (the international face of a country) seriously when they have appeared on Comic Relief? These increasingly deperate attempts by the leader of our country to ingratiate himself to the electorate are making me embarrassed to be British. Could you imagine another world leader appearing on Comic Relief (or their country's equivalent)? This petition is not against Comic Relief (I support it fully) but surely there are enough comedians and \"celebrities\" out there who could appear on this show??",
