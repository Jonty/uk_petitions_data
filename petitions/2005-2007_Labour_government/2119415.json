            "background": "Acton Main Line Station is poorly served for trains. One every half hour, which is often cancelled, leaving passengers stranded. The information boards often don't work and the telephone number printed on the information intercom is unobtainable . There are no trains on Sunday at all. \nAlthough there are several other stations in Acton none are near to Acton Main Line and all are to far to away to reach from this area by walking. The last train from Paddington to Greenford leaves at 9.30 pm so forcing people to use their cars to travel into London in order to see a show or go to a restaurant. \nThe steps to the platform are far to steep, and the trains on the westbound platform stop miles away from the exit.\nHeathrow connect which stops at all the other local stations misses out Acton Main Line altogether.\nIt would be far more useful to improve this service, than waste money on the West London Tram",
