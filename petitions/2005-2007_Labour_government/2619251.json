            "background": "The government proposes a new council tax valuation system giving inspectors rights to enter any home & look for 'improvements' to excuse to increased rateable value. Likely infringements on privacy & security of householders include: 1 \u2013 forcing the provision by householders & profiting from the sale of personal information & details about the size & condition of households, number of bedrooms and parking places; 2 - giving inspectors the RIGHT to enter homes, look for & PHOTOGRAPH '\u201devidence\u201d of' \u201cluxury\u201d living, removing the right of individuals to privacy within their own home, even bedroom; 3 - increasing taxes based on perceived \"luxury\" amenities eg showers in the bathroom, garden sheds, patios, off-road parking etc; The policy penalises homeowners for spending already taxed income on home improvement, disincentivising maintainence improvement of home and neighbourhood. It will place people, especially the elderly at risk from conmen pretending to be from the Council.",
