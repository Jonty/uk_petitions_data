            "background": "Always the same big companies rule this country,  don' t rock the boat when it comes to greed and money.  All the small business's that have had to close due to numerous legislations put upon them, but when it comes to an extremely large company the likes of Bernard Matthews it does not appear to matter that the health conditions at his factories are shall we say not only less than satisfactory but disgusting. Therefore should he get fined, oh no! let's pay him hugh amounts of money.  I wonder where the compensation culture comes from in this country.  I understand that America is now trying to cut down on this whilst we are increasing it wholesale.",
