        "background": "Children are taken from mothers for 'at risk of emotional harm' if the child has or could witness domestic violence between parents.Judges/social services are not using section 38 in the childrens Act excluding abusers from the home.It should be LAW as in America that it is more harmful to seperate child and mother than to remove child.It be'compulsory'in All care proceedings a section 38 be used in ALL cases involving domestic violence before any removal of children.Government says'do not suffer in silence domestic violence',when mothers do ring the police for help they make a referal to social services who then take the children away from an already distraught mother.\nNo battered parent should be abused by the very state that is supposed to protect her but instead punishes her for a crime she did not commit but committed against her.Children are being adopted by social services that have been taken away from mothers who fought to get them back in the family courts even though they did not commit a crime.Families are destroyed by social services,leaving mothers and fathers childless and children in a system which leaves them more vunerable to abuse by strangers.",
