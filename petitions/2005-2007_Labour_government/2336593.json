If the threshold was raised to say 50% for anything over \u00a3100k then really high earners like directors and footballers would pay more tax, instead of us very hard working people who earn just over the current threshold. Take the money off those who can afford it, not from us who want to try and build a better life for our children. Stop being the opposite of Robin Hood, please, take from the rich, not the poor",
