            "action": "order a review of the sentence passed on Thomas Palmer of only 20years for the murder of two schoolboys, T.Wood Nadauld aged 14 and Steven Bayliss aged 16, stabbed to death by Palmer in woods in Finchampstead, Berkshire on the evening of 11th September 2005.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Palmer pleaded not guilty but was found guilty by the Jury for what the Thames Valley Police described as \"a brutal and sustained attack\". T.Wood received 23 stab wounds and Steven received 14, one of them almost decapitating him. The evidence in court was so disturbing that even the Police officer who was giving evidence wept as he did so as did the Jury and families present. \n\nFollowing the verdict Justice Bean  discounted 30% off the mandatory 30 years \"Life\" sentence because of Palmers age (being 18 at the time of the double murder). With time already served on remand, Palmer will walk the streets again when he is 38 years old after serving only 18 years.\n\nThe Attorney General turned down an appeal for a review made by the Crown Prosecution Service who took the unsual step of making the appeal themselves because of the leniency of the sentence. The Prosecuting barristers said they have never felt so strongly about a sentencing before and immediately following Justice Beans comments informed familes they would be taking the unusual step of appealling straight away. \nThe Attorney General's Office took less than 3 weeks to come to a decision.",
