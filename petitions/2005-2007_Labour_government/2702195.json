            "background": "The government should supply free solar panels and all equipment needed to run the service to all households in the uk starting from the poorest to the richest.\n\nany unused power after costs for equipmwnt are met can be sold back into the national grid to help support industries useage.\n\nthe costs for this would be approx \u00a310000 per house which i believe would be payed back in under 5 yrs due to savings and also this would help the uk reach its emmissions targets more easily.\n\nAll houses would be getting free heating and some of their essential electricity for free.",
