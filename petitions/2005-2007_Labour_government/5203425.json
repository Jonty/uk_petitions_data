It is important to create a brand and image that the UK people (and other nations) find readable, creative and attractive.\n\nThe \u00a3400,000 spent on the current design is wasteful and will turn even more people off the games. It glorifies graffiti, it is difficult to read, it looks like a mess, a half effort.\n\nThis is not an abstract art competition, we need something to be proud of, something to get behind.",
