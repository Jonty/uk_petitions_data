They are unable to register their protest  vote as no facility is included in the ballot paper for a protest.\n\nIf a voter does not wish to vote for a listed candidate the only choice available is to spoil the ballot paper or to refrain from voting. As spoiled  ballot papers are reported as voters being unable to fill in the form correctly the vote is not recognised as a protest.\n\nI petition the electorial commission to introduce a protest voting space on every ballot paper, this will allow voters dissillusioned with the system and who do not wish to vote for any candidate have their protest counted and announced .",
