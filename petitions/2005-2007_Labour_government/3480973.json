            "background": "Windows Vista is being forced without choice on most purchasers of computers in the UK. By using OEM computer providers they are stifling competition and perpetuating their stranglehold on the marketplace.\nThe use of loss leaders in order to maintain their position and marketing money used to prevent their competition from gaining distribution artificially makes the Operating System cheaper than it actually is.\nWe ask that the law be changed to outlaw Microsoft's OEM licensing practices and to prevent suppliers placing what amounts to a \"Windows Tax\" on every company they sell.",
