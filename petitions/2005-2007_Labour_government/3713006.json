        "background": "Local Authorities need biodiversity information (as does central Government) to meet their commitments to the environment, to wildlife, and to the benefits accruing to their local populations from interaction with wildlife and greenspace.\n\nA local records centre to collate, manage, validate and disseminate such information collected by amateur naturalists and professional ecologists for free is an extremely efficient and long-term solution to this need.\n\nCurrently, most/all LRCs are struggling to remain sustainable due to a lack of funding (the cost of funding an LRC is low!) as most/many LAs do NOT meet their statutory commitments. Enforcement of funding for LRCs via LAs would ensure such data was available.",
