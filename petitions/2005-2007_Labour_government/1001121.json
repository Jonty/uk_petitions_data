            "background": "WE do not have to ban this american holiday completly because it is good for kids but its not fair to have people begging at your door every 5 mineuts (especially if your a OAP). This would just be banning people knocking randomly on doors and beggin for sweets but we could keep the other parts for kids like dressing up. This is a american born holiday and most other european countries do not celebrate it, this would not cause a public backlash as its not like christmas.",
