            "background": "Smoking should be allowed for the elderly within care homes. To expect them to stand or sit outside in the winter especially, is ludicrous. When they get into their 70's 80's and 90's expecting them to give up the weed is also stupid. Let the elderly enjoy their sunset years give them a ventilated smoking room away from staff and other residents.The law declares they can smoke in their own bedrooms, health and safety says \"no you can't smoke in your bedroom\" within a care home. So where do they go????? Give them a break and let them use the care home as if it were their own home, where they would smoke if they wished.",
