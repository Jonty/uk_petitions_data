        "background": "The prime ministerial petitions scheme is a welcome development, however it seems to be somewhat flawed in that people can only register support for a particular cause but cannot register opposition to it.  This may lead to a cause appearing to have strong public support when, in fact, there are a greater number of opponents than supporters.\n\nThis sitution can easily be remedied by providing the publilc with the option of registering opposition to a cause as well the option of signing up to it.  The number of registered opponents could be displayed alongside the number of registered signatories.",
