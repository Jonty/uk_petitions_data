            "action": "force rail companies to have a minimum number of cycle spaces and provide more carraiges or face re-nationalisation. These improvements should be funded in part by taxation of air and car travel in order to help reduce carbon emmissions below the Kyoto level by 2012",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We believe that combining cycling and rail travel is the best way to encourage people to travel long distances in the most efficient and environmentally friendly way.\n\nThere should not be any conditions attatched to taking cycles on trains, such as the need for advance bookings. There should be at least 10 places on each train. \n\nWe believe that current rail companies policies prevent people from travelling in an environmentally friendly manner and with their monopoly on routes and massive subsidies there is no incentive to be efficient and reduce fairs. Re-nationalisation is the only viable way to reduce costs for consumers and increase capacity on the rail network.\n\nThis should be funded at least in part by a European wide taxation of air and car travel.",
