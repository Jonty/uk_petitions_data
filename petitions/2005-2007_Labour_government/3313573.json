        "background": "Like many others, I have fond memories of the old one-pound note and I would like to see it reinstated for general use as is still current in Scotland. It was a great signal of Great Britain and it im not asking for it to replace to one-pound coin but merely as nostalgic alternative to it. It would give a lovely aspect the next time you ask your friends to \u2018lend us 40 sheets till pay day\u2019 because they could technically lend you 40 pound notes, and the best thing about the pound notes is that you always feel like you\u2019ve got more money in your pocket than you actually have thus promoting good feeling throughout the nation! Come on guys please sign this for old times sake!",
