            "background": "As the Drug companies seek to get increasingly bigger with more control of our health, they are affecting the subtler aspects of Herbal medicines being available to all. With laboratory synthesised products, that merely resemble their natural origins, the body is unable to get full use of these trace elements, slowly creating an increasingly unhealthy society.\nIf there was honour in the Drug industry\nthe space for all to practice their art would not be blocked as it is. \nThere needs to be some sort of ceiling for drug companies to be contained within, instead of continuously expanding.",
