            "background": "I believe that speculators and investors are responsible for the ureasonable escalation of Britain's housing stock. It is now almost impossible for young people to get on to the housing ladder as they have been priced out of the market. One of the main factors in creating a stable relationship is having the security of your own home. If home owners were limited to one domestic property it would inevitably reduce house prices and bring back to life many of the villages in our country.",
