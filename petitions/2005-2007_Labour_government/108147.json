        "background": "We ask that the Prime Minister makes efforts to remove from the statute books all offences under the law that relate to a person's stated opinion EXCEPT direct incitement to violence.\nOpinion is not dangerous - speech that is racist and sexist is given power by making it illicit. Protecting those with religious beliefs from critisism of their faith is disproportionate as it, by definition, puts their beliefs above those who have contrary opinion.\nBy removing robust opinion from the media and from everyday life, by silencing the extreme arguement, we risk becoming less sophisticated in our understanding of issues and our fellow man.\nWe ask that you allow us to offend and be offended - to enjoy the entire experience of being free thinking and intelligent creatures. To meet extreme opinion with our own rebuttals instead of arrest. To be intellectual, reactionary, wrong, disgusting, inspiring, obscene, delusional and hold beliefs - all without the fear of sanction.",
