            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I feel that people who have an illness such as dementia/ alzheimers are treated unfairly in comparison to people who suffer from physical illness. The NHS should pay for the continuing care of people who are ill with dementia/ alzheimers whilst they are in nursing home care. If a person has been assessed as in need of perm nursing care in a home why should they be forced to fund the care themselves often by selling their homes .A person with a longterm physical illness treated in hospital ie coma is not expected to sell their home to pay for care,so why should dementia patients be expected to fund their illness. It is immoral that you are penalised depending on the type of illness that you have.The process for obtaining continuing care in the NHS is unfair. It is complicated, confusing & inconsistent. Your local PCT decides each case & the decisions vary nationwide. I believe the govt should fund nursing home care automatically.",
