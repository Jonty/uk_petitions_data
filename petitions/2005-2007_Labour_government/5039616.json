            "background": "Stop all freedom of movement and the automatic right to work and live in this and other EU countries. With the lack of work for British people in their own country we feel that no-one should have the right to come here automatically because they are in the EU.  EU migrants can work for lower wages and even get children's benefit for those children they have that still reside in their own country. Some British people waiting for housing find themselves further down the list.  NHS struggle with the new influx of people, schools are finding it hard. Whereby most British people have mortgages and insurances heavy fuel bills etc along with paying Brown\u2019s heavy tax rate on our wages. Having more migrants in this country helps keep down wages (bad news for the British people) unless of course you are an MP then you have big wages, can claim expenses and finish up with a lovely big pension.",
