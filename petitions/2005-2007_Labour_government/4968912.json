            "action": "legislate to improve and enforce standards of customer service, care, equity and accessibilty of all essential utility companies to give the energy watch dogs powers beyond the reporting of failures, and to protect the public from inept ,and inadequate services.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Customers of utility companies are feeling increasingly powerless to complain and have their complaints taken seriously.  Queueing times on telephone systems can make it incredibly frustrating to get even the simplest questions answered or problem attended to.  Despite the fact that utilities such as gas are essential to modern life the 'systems' in place are entirely inadequate.  The poorest customers are often expected to pay the highest tariffs which is entirely inequitable.  There is a culture of buck passing and blaming system failure for errors that impact considerably on people's lives.  It is time to acknowledge that essential services MUST be provided with due diligence and that customers' needs are given due consideration.",
