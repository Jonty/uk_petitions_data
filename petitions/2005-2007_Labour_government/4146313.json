            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Despite having the highest train fares in the world for passengers not able to book well in advance, we still have some of the most overcrowded trains in Europe because of chronic under investment in capacity. There are great benefits in safety, economy and the comfort of road users in shifting heavy freight from road to rail but this is being stiffled by high access charges and lack of capacity. There are lots of 'hidden charges' in road transportation e.g. policing, emergency services, road deaths & injuries and very high CO2 emissions. We need greater capacity on our railway, lower fares and new lines where there is demand.",
