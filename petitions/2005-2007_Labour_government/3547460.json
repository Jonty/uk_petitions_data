I can guarantee most households have bags full of bags not being used which slowly add up each time they go to the supermarket; some shoppers like to have a bag from a trendy shop as a souvenir of what expensive item they've bought, it's a waste! It seems only SANE and obvious to quickly create an alternative, a biodegradable environmentally friendly replacement.",
