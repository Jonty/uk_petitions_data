        "background": "Squash is one of the most physically demanding sports in the world in which Britain excels at.  Squash has been a popular game which can be played all year round. This game was created by the British public the same time football and rugby in post industrial Britain and I believe is still a main part of British culture.  The facilities needed are cost effective as a big arena is not needed due to small courts and there is a low maintenance cost therefore they will not be expensive to leave the legacy.  Squash needs a big event to create publicity for this sport as in Britain the game is dying out.",
