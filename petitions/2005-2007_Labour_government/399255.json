            "background": "I would like to see the goverment reduce the restrictions on energy saving grants. The grants are geared up discriminate against certain family brackets based on them receiving benefits and having a low income. What this means is that I like thousands of others who earn an average wage and don't take benefits miss out on grants to help save energy and cannot afford to fund it alone, the result of this is that we are then unable to contribute to what is a very important issue to all of us.",
