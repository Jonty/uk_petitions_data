            "background": "Cheshire County Council have instigated an initial consultation period to assess the strength of local opinion relating to the proposed closure of Delamere Church of England School in Delamere, Cheshire. The school is a vital part of the community with undeniably strong links to St. Peters Church in Delamere.  The building is a beautiful Grade II listed building constructed on land provided by HM Queen Victoria in 1844. The school has a warm and vibrant family ethos and all of the Parents and Children love the school very much.  The governments policies with regards to education were supposed to focus on the wellbeing of our children and to provide parents with choices for their education and happiness, unfortunately the opposite is a reality! The ultimate closure of Delamere C of E School will have a profound impact on the local and wider community and must not be permitted.",
