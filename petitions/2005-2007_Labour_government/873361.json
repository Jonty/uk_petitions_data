You only need to watch a clip and you will sex, group sex, teenagers taking drugs, getting out of there face drunk. It is absolutely diabolical that our t.v directors allow such positive encouragemtent on such life destroying issues.  It's not a healthy culture to encourage to anyone let alone our children.  Go to the website it's all school kids that are looking forward to it starting.  They dream of being in parties just like the ones skins promotes.  Parties where drugs are taken, girls are devalued and raped, underage sex, drunkeness violence.  HOW CAN WE ALLOW SUCH DISGUSTING BEHAVIOUR TO BE PROMOTED IN THIS WAY!!!!!!!",
