        "background": "Making special needs awareness a compulsory part of teacher training, including awareness of education and disability laws and the appropriate and safe use of restraint \nEnsuring all Teaching Assistants who are supporting a child with special needs have relevant training related to the child's needs \nGiving the responsibility to assess the special needs of children to an independent panel in order to remove the conflict of interest that currently exists within Local Education Authorities where they are responsible for both assessing need, as well as funding, provision and monitoring \nProviding transparency in the process of statutory assessment, including audits of the time it takes from a parent or school's first application to the actual delivery of a Statement of SEN, and reduce the maximum time allowed to provide a Statement once it is agreed that one is needed \nAddressing the problem of the bullying of special needs children in mainstream schools as a priority. 60% of children with asperger's and 40% with autism are bullied in school,in nearly half these cases (44%) the school takes no action and in more than 1/2 the child has missed school or had to change schools",
