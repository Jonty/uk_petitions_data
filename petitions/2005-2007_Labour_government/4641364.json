            "background": "The government and lottery alike, consistently wastes thousands of pounds in offering sports funding to student athletes who are unable to compete seriously at regional and national level, due to consistently better competition not picked up from the initial 'system' vetting form of applicants. This money is wasted by those athletes to pay off student loans/funding socialising when there are many students who are not eligible for a typical student loan because of means-testing parents, and are unable to fund their children/students because of high house prices and expensive council tax. The government merely requests applications and does not invest time following grants up; to ensure the party receiving them is performing at the expected level. They are currently given out inappropriately. If the party receiving the grant does not perform, and has received it because they 'know the system' or have contacts in society at this level, then they should be made to give the grant back. This is costing the public MILLIONS and could assist in the significant decrease of council tax for MILLIONS of payers if action is taken.",
