            "background": "Motor vehicle ownership should be subject to the normal common sense rules for owning property. If you do not have a place to keep the property then you cannot have it. This should also apply to motor vehicles and be enforced by legislation that enforces owners to have an off road location (either owned or rented) to park their vehicles when not in use. This would reduce the congestion in residential roads and reduce vehicle ownership.",
