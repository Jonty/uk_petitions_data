            "background": "vehicle garages are not monitored and have accountability to no one - this allows them to rip certain members of the public off - charging whatever they want for 'repairs or mechanical work ' that do not exist - eg; worn rubber brushes that cost \u00a320 + \u00a340 to fit plus vat - turning into ' a three hour job costing \u00a3300 +vat - just one of a big scam that happens regularly to a lot of people.\nMake garages accountable - by whatever means the gov. can - garages are conning people by doing  non - existant work and charging a lot of money - or not doing the required work - and charging for it. Please put a stop to this now - make all garages & mechanics accountable to a gov. agency that will carry out regular inspections on qualifications, credibility , quality, honesty and pricing.",
