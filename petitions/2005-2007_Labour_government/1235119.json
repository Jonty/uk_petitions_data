            "background": "Only 1500 of the countries sunbed salons are members of \"The Sunbed Association\" which has strict rules as to how sunbed salons should operate. This only accounts for a very small percentage of the salons. All other sunbed salons operate with no rules or regulation.\nThe government should make all sunbed salon's join the association and make the industry regulated.\nThis should also include banning salons that have no staff to make sure that people under the age of 16 do not use the sunbeds or to make sure that people only use them for the correct period.\nThese self service salon's do not safeguard customers and increase the risk of skin cancer",
