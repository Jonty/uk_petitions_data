        "background": "I object to the fact that tax paying members of the public are expected to'pick up the tab'for failed pvte pension schemes.Facing constant council tax rises,road pricing,basic wage rises year upon year,why should we pay for the current pensioners and the failings of 'a gamble'.If I put \u00a310 on a horse and it loses is the government going to compensate me too.Had their pension scheme survived would they have shared their wealth with the rest of the population of England,NO.Private pension members are told that the value may go down as well as up..this is the gamble we take..why should we pay for those who assumed that they were 100% safe.I agree that this can't happen again in the future for the sake of our children/ grandchildren however,do not make the current generation pay twice,to subsidise an enhanced standard of living for the few unfortunate people who have found themselves in this postion,who will still get a state pension,unlike my children and future grandchildren.",
