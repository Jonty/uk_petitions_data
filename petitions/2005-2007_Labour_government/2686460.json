            "background": "The Japanese Government\u2019s whaling fleet is on the seas now, targeting 935 minke whales and 10 endangered fin whales. Most of whale populations remain depleted, some to the point of extinction. \n\nLoopholes in the IWC convention allow commercial whaling to continue. Under IWC rules, any member country can object an IWC decision within 90 days, and be exempt from that decision. Norway and Iceland objected. \n\nJapan found a loophole that allows countries to kill whales for \u201cscientific research\u201d The IWC requested that Japan stop this \u201cresearch,\u201d but rules allow Japan to ignore them. Meat from this \u201cresearch\u201d is packaged and sold on the market.\n\nA recent poll shows 95% of  Japanese people have never/rarely eat whale meat, there is more than 5,000 tons in cold storage, unsold/unwanted. 69% of Japanese people don\u2019t support whaling.\n\nWe need to stop this.",
