            "background": "We propose that the fitting of black boxes and satelite tracking systems also known as Intelligent Speed Adaptation to private motor vehicles is not only a gross invasion of personal privacy and a furthering of a big brother state(ie,the government would have records of All your journeys and movements at ALL times) but also a severely flawed idea of a road safety device.Said devices are undesirable as they take control of the vehicle from the driver/rider leading to a potential loss of concentration and in the case of a system where the engine is cut or brakes applied by the system to reduce speed this could be dangerous to the following road users or as has been proven in previous experiments on motorcycles can cause loss of control of the vehicle.Therefore these systems should be banned from all future consideration.",
