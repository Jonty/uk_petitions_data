No overtaking of any stationery bus so that they can pull out and make progress.\n2.  At junctions and roundabouts instant priority for buses, all other vehicles must let them out.\n3.  Red route markings on all bus routes so no stopping or parking at any time, especially outside schools.\n4.  CCTV on all buses admissable as evidence in court, offenders against the above will have their licence to drive withheld for 1 week (1st offence), 1 month (2nd offence) and 6 months (further offences).",
