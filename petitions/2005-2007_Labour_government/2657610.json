            "background": "Foreign lorries are allowed to roam freely around the Uk,they can undercut UK haulage companies because they rarely buy fuel here and are not subject to our road tax. We on the other hand pay any/all tolls and taxes associated to the country that we are driving through.\nTherefore if they were charged per day that they are operating in the UK it would benefit our Road Haulage operators, those that are involved in accidents with them and raise revenue for the country as a whole.",
