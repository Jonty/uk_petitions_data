PLEASE lead the way to stop this mad aim and ensure your legacy for the rest of history.\n\n\tIt is useless and arrogant to exhort others to do without when we cling on to such weapons.  Example speaks louder than  words.\n       Hazel Chesterman-Phillips (Author)\n\n(020 8959 7040 ) (email:hazelc-p@tiscali.co,uk)",
