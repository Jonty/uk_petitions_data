            "background": "The middleclass in this country are getting a raw deal. Helping students whos parents earn less than \u00a330k per year is completley unfair. It should be based on circumstances of the student. I'm 18 and about to go to uni in sept. I've worked and gone to college since i was 16. I recieve little financial help from my parents and don't want to burden them when I go to uni. As they earn between \u00a335k to \u00a340k per year im not entitled to any help. I still have the same needs of anyone else. If my parents were 'seperated' or earned less, i would have been entitled to \u00a330 per week EMA + bounses, from the age of 16 and now gotten help with uni fees. Now to me that says that it pays better to be lazy becuase if you work hard like my parents have their whole life it doesnt pay off for things like this becuase they now have to fund me. They might as well of played the system and had a much easier life. Systems like this don't give anyone ambition to acheive.",
