            "background": "It's very sad that in todays society and because of a few undesirable people, schools are banning parents from photographing their children. Parents don't have any photographic record of their children in school growing up any more.  You can not put society in a protective bubble and instill fear into every parent.  Strangers don't usually attend school events, so what's the problem?  Please Mr Blair, tell school head teachers to allow parents to photograph and video their own children at those most memorable moments in their lives.",
