        "background": "There are already some petitions in the direction of reducing religious indoctrination in schools, but the others are directed against faith schools.  This petition is directed against the fact that non-faith state schools presently give a privileged status to religion in general and to the state religion (Christianity) in particular and this is done by law.\n  Please sign if you think this is wrong and if you share my view that (even if faith schools should be available for those who choose them) those who do not choose them and who choose to send their children to state schools should have a right to expect their children to be educated free from religious indoctrination.",
