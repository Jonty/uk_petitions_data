            "background": "Working like a refrigerator in reverse, if your garden is not too small and if you can dig down 2 metres without meeting a sewer or underground railway, you may be able to extract free heat from the soil.\nA simple flexible plastic pipe is run along the trench. Every 10 metres of pipe should give you IKW of heat.\nIt needs electricity to run, but 75% less than heating by electric.  If you have a large hot water tank you should be able to extract most of the heat using \"off peak\" electricity saving another 60%.\nInstalling a wind turbine, or pv panels might give you free electricity\nto run all or part of the system.\nYour house needs to be insulated to a very high standard to benefit fully from this system. Underfloor heating for new build is best (saving another 10%)but it is possible to instal underfloor heating in existing houses on some sites.\nDomestic water can work off the same system, however if you want really hot water some back up heating will be necessary.",
