            "background": "Language teachers will feel they are being put out of a job but Esperanto is a beautiful expressive language with a fast learning curve making an ideal introduction to other languages. A common language is now particularly important because of the enlarged EU and the rising prosperity of countries like China. Esperanto has a very regular structure. Words are often made from many other roots, and so the number of words which one must memorise is reduced.  The language is phonetic, and the rules of pronunciation are very simple, so that everyone knows how to pronounce a written word and vice-versa. Many words are already familiar to us Europeans. There are textbooks and self-instruction materials in more than 100 languages. All this make the learning of the language relatively easy and a wider spread of children would benefit from Esperanto as a second language.",
