The structures, uniforms and funding of both the ATC and the CCF(RAF) vary immensely and need to be brought under a single command and organisation.\n\nAs the ATC was established by a Royal Warrant in 1941 the new organisation should have \"Royal\" as its prefix and a name \"Royal Air Force Cadets\" or similar.",
