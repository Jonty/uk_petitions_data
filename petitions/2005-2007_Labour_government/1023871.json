            "background": "The current scheme for taxing a car looks at both engine size and emmisions. I put forward that this system should also take into account the \"carbon cost\" of manufacturing a vehicle. This is often over looked and in many cases the new breed of low emmision \"green\" cars cost much more in \"carbon\" to manufacture. So much more that during their entire lifetime they will have been more enviromentaly damaging that a cheaper less fuel efficient alternative.",
