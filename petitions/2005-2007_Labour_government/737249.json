            "background": "The recent budget announcement to double air flight taxes from Feb 2007 will apply retrospectively to everyone flying after that date even if they purchased the tickets a year before the budget announcement. \n\nIt's a bit like buying a tank of fuel a few weeks ago, having a budget announcement of fuel tax increases and then retrospectively charging anyone who has not yet used this fuel.\n\nTo avoid this being viewed as a money raising exercise and to be fair and wise ,they should not apply the increases to anyone who booked the flights prior to the budget announcement.",
