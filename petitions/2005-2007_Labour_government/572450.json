            "background": "It is clear to me that if we wish to remain a world influence both fighting and supporting countries that are either in conflict or suffering an environmental crisis we need a Navy of at least 150 surface ships. I believe we need 4 new carriers not 2 and many more modern frigates, destroyers and support ships. This investment and increase in size of the Navy would also employ many young men and women who otherwise have no jobs and few future prospects. Not only that the new ships should be built in the UK again supplying much needed jobs in our few remaining ship yards.",
