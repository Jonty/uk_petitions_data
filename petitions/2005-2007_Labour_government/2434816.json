        "background": "The 4x4 scurge pollutes the atmosphere, takes up space on roads beyond the sensible and allows people who inherrently cant drive to own a large car. I would like to see these moving monoliths taxed to the point they are too expensive to drive. How many times do you see these things scuttling two kids to school with Mum/ Dad at the wheel, why cant they either cram in a mini (lets face it most of them only go a few hundred yards), get a bike or walk! We have become a lazy, sit on your backside nation and these vehicles only add to the problem. Get them off the roads asap",
