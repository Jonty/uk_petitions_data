        "background": "By scrapping bus lanes the flow of traffic at peak times will be reduced as there will be 1 extra lane for traffic to use. Congestion will be reduced and there will be no need for a road pricing scheme. On most main roads approx. 20 buses will use a bus lane per hour. This is a waste of road space and can be put to better use by allowing all vehicles to use them.",
