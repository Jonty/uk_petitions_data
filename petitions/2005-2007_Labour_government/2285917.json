After being told the law is unfair by the Citizens Advice Bureau and my bank, I think it is time for a change in the law / policies of money lending agencies. I propose that if a relationship breaks down then any outstanding joint debts should be automatically split so both parties have responsibility for paying and payment for the amount due doesn't just fall on one party.",
