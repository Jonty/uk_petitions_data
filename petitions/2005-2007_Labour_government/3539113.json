            "background": "People who play music and make other unneccessary noise with total disregard for the community living next door and all around them are making a misery of the lives of thousands of people, particularly in urban areas, and often leads to depression, anxiety, insomnia and other illneses.  The level of noise deemed by local councils to be a \"statutory nuisance\" is a grey area and often far too low and often only considered a problem if it occurs after 11pm. The procedures for getting the councils to act is very long and tedious and in need of review. Residents should not have to endure someone elses music invading their homes at any audable level, or at any time of day.  This matter should not be simply left to council workers to spend weeks investigating and police should be given strict powers to deal immediatly with this kind of anti-social behaviour which they currently only have for extreme cases.",
