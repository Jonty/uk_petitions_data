            "action": "congratulate Sir Andrew Green for his accurate and impartial reporting and analysis of the effects of uncontrolled mass immigration to the UK that has occurred in recent years, and to follow his recommendations on controlling the nation's borders and then to establish well resourced governmental programmes to restore the social cohesion and prosperity of that now distressed, but former bedrock of English society, composed of traditional working class families.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Sir Andrew Green has been alerting the UK to the extent, and dangers, of the current uncontrolled immigration to the UK.   The Home Office has been forced to concede that his immigration forecasts use assumptions that are often below the Government Actuary department's high migration scenarios.   Some two million non-settlement visas to the UK are issued every year, yet there are no checks on departure.   Even where asylum seekers are refused permission to stay, they can receive public funding to employ lawyers who will often use every legalistic means to stay.  The unprecedented demographic changes caused by mass immigration are close to destroying all social cohesion, threatening the survival itself of the English nation and have severely damaged the life chances for employment and a sense of community for the majority of our young.  Unless the Government now acts decisively in these vital areas of our national life, the English people will feel they have been totally betrayed by the political and media elites.",
