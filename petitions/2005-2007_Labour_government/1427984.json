            "background": "Westbound M56 users wishing to transit Southbound on the M6 are forced to use the dangerous and congested A556. Likewise M6 Northbound users wishing to transit Eastbound on the M56 also have to use the A556 as there are no exit slip roads at junction 20. The Secretary of State has already rejected plans to build these 2 additional exits. This is a massive inconvenience and danger to not only road users but also homeowners along the A556. Traffic flow and congestion is unacceptable along the A556, which was not designed for such traffic volumes.",
