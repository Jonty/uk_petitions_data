        "background": "County coucils up and down the country give approval to companys large and small to build houses. As part of the infrastructure roads and sewers are installed. A lot of these roads and sewers are never adopted by the highway agency or water authority, as they dont come up to the standard set by the agency. County councils are not and will not take any responsibility for the construction of these roads and sewers, but the goverment and councils expect the house holder to pay his council tax and road tax for their use.",
