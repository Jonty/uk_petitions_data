Much of this effort is completely wasted because many plastics are the \"wrong\" type and are returned to the householder to be sent to landfill. Many householders then cannot see any point in making the effort to re-cycle so they stop.\nPackaging producers would be restricted to using only two or three approved types of materials, marked more clearly than at present, to encourage better re-use of these precious petro-chemical resources.",
