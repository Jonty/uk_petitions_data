            "background": "In Australia, when you go to the post office and buy your yearly road tax disc, part of the money goes to a central fund which covers any third parties who are in volved in an accident with that vehicle. Citizens can then purchase their own insurance to cover their losses. \n\nThe benefit of this is that no one can drive uninsured and, if they do are, easilly indentifiable by the abscence of a legal tax disc. This will pevent a lot of people driving off after minor bumps when they dont have insurance. Currently the fine for this is only \u00a3200 when road tax would cost a similar amount.",
