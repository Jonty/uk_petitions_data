The fact of more votes in the pension issue should not influence a decision as it is the errors and failures that are important to discover and correct. \nIt would appear that Lloyd\u2019s are still not complying fully with the law on audit.\nWe welcome the Prime Minister\u2019s actions in establishing this petition right and call on him to take action in holding an inquiry.",
