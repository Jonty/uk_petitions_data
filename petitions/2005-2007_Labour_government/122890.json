            "background": "Mr. Blair, please make us debt-free by doing the following:\n\n1) Privatise all of those London transport companies that are state-owned or locally-owned\n2) Ask the rulers of those countries who owe us debts to pay the money back\n3) Cancel the debt pardon for African countries that were pardoned, so that they repay the debt\n\nThis also applies to the money we contributed to the EU overseas aid budget. We think that it's wrong for Europe to subsidise the incompetent, corrupt governments of Third World countries, and waste our money on aid for countries that waste it by waging wars against each other. We can help Africa - by inventing the cure for AIDS. We shouldn't subsidise their governments though.",
