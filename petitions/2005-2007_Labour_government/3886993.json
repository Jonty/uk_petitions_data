If  you agree that they in fact don\u2019t then please sign this petition.\n\nAt present of you are living with your partner, and either of you have lost your job, you are not eligible for Jobseeker\u2019s Allowance or Income Support unless your partner works less than 16 hours a week, and is on a very low wage.\n\nThe direct result of this, to put it simply, is that your partner has to support you entirely. That is, they have to pay: all the rent/mortgage, bills, full council tax and prescription charges etc. \n\nHowever, if you are in a long-term relationship, but not living together \u2013 even if you have children together \u2013 you will be eligible for benefits, housing, pay no council tax, free prescriptions and so on.\n\nMy M.P, agreed with me that this amounted to discrimination against couples who live together. \n\nThank you for taking the time to read this petition, and I hope you will support it by signing it.\n\nWith thanks,\n\nEdward Somerville BA (Hons.)
