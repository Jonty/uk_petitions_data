        "background": "There are still workers in this country who get only 20-30 mins break per 8-hour shift. This is insufficient for a proper rest and barely enough to eat. Certainly it is not enough to away from the work station and get exercise during the day. This results in poor work-life balance and poor health. All workers should be entitled to one hour break per eight hour shift.",
