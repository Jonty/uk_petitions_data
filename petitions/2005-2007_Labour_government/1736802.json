        "action": "Stop the closesure of St Georges RC High School, Little Hulton, M28 3SH",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The school is in a proposal by the Salford City Council to spend money on ALL the Schools within the councils area EXCEPT this one. A NEW PFI school is being built next to St Georges where currently a C of E school is sited. The C of E school has around 700 puplils now BUT the newly built school will have 1200! This means that they must expect St Georges pupils to attend the NEW school. The strange facts are that out of both schools St Georges has been successful for many years and also has a higher ranking in the school league tables SO WHY CLOSE IT? The easy solution would be to build a smaller PFI school and also invest in a remodel for St Georges BUT for some unknown reason the council can't see this. Having both schools within the area would still be cost effective and would also give parents a choice. Please help us see the logic in keeping St Georges OPEN and thus to continue to provide a happy education enviroment for the area's children.",
