            "background": "Many main roads have had cycle lanes created to give greater protection to cyclists and car drivers from each other. A lot of cost has gone into the creation of cycle lanes and a lot of inconvenience to the car driver with car lanes being closed to facilitate the creation of these lanes. A large number of cyclists still insist on cycling on the road (cycle clubs mainly) even though there is a perfect cycle lane for them to use. They do not follow the highway code which says that cyclists should give due consideration to cars by moving to avoid any traffic jam. These cyclists should be fined for these offences just as drivers are fined for driving with undue care and attention to other drivers.",
