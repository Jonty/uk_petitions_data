            "background": "The idea is to create all year round clean fresh water outdoor swimming areas by converting our existing local municiple park lakes.\n\nThe lakes could be dredged, filtered, and heated using the latest green technologies, this would also help bring back lost species of plants and insects/animals using reed beds.\n\nPark cafes with changing rooms could be built using existing parkeepers as attendants.\nProfits made by the cafe and changing rooms could help pay for it.\n\nIt could also be safely used to convert into outdoor ice skating during the winter months where the concept already exists in austria.\n\nThe government must create a seperate body to finance it seperately from local council budgets.",
