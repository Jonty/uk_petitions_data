            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Local authorities must take responisibility for the methods used to recover unpaid council tax bills. Councils are not protecting their \"customers\" by using rogue bailiffs to bully, harrass, misinform and threaten often vunerable people, often refusing to negotiate realistic payments forcing people further in to debt and causing serious effects on the health of victims. The council should be made to ensure a duty of care to the local inhabitants that any debt recovery agencies adhere to principles which do not infringe on our human rights as they currently do. The current proposal to increase bailiff's authority will be a grave mistake and SHOULD NOT GO AHEAD",
