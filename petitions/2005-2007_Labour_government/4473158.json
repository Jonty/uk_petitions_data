            "background": "Sterilisation is the only way to stop sex offenders from re-offending because it stems their sex drive. It is proven to be the case because this method is used in Germany. Sterilisation can be undertaken with the consent of the offender. Sex offenders are not able to control their sex drive without the operation and after the operation could be safely released back into the community whilst if they are locked up without operation, they are very likely to re-offend upon release. No other method will work with people who cannot control themselves. Repeat offenders refusing to have the operation should get extended sentences and be tagged permanently on release.",
