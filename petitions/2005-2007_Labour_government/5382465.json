            "background": "I feel as a student in full time education (16yrs old) I am having to pay much of my minimal part-time income on travelling to school, paying adult fairs. I think, along with others, that if a \"Child\" is still in full time education they should travel on reduced fair at least until they are 18. If the legal age to drink is 18, as that is when deemed an adult, why is it only 16 for public transport? to raise more revenue???",
