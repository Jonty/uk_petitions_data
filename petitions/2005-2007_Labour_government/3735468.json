            "background": "if we increase the age of passing the driving test this could help on road congestion and would mean less young drivers on the road .there are hundreds of young children driving cars/ scooters they have no road sense. if you look at the age for drinking its 18 so why not cars/scooters etc or even up it to 21. these children are far too young to be driving a machine that is very capable of hurting or even killing innocent road users and pedestrians. i myself have had several scooter riders sitting so close to the rear of my car i cant see them in my mirrors if i was to brake suddenly what would be the outcome ? and some of the times there riding in packs sometimes side by side . all i am saying is there still babies who have no sense of the dangers out on the roads for there safety and for the reduction of congestion this could benefit every one including the environment.....",
