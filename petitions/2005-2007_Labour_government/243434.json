            "background": "Given that about 3,000 of about 60,000 children are permenently placed each year it is clear that adoption rules are too stringent in many respects.\n\nRecent media stories would have it that a mixed race couple cannot usually adopt a child unless a mixed race child is available.\n\nIf true, there would seem to be much too much political correctness in the adoption process.\n\nThe numbers being adopted are appalling - it must mean that only older children are available primarily because of the time spent prior to adoption in foster or other homes.\n\nThe children's long term need for a stable home must begin to override this level of political correctness / interference.\n\nWe the undersigned ask the Prime Minister to support a fundamental reform of the adoption process to make it easier to place more children, to place them earlier and therefore to increase the potential number of adoptive couples who may prefer to adopt younger children.",
