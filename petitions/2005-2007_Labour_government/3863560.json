However having done no good whatsoever they then leave and work the after-dinner circuit or similar, leaving others to suffer problems caused by their tenure.\n\nI suggest that Government Ministers should be liable to be challenged in court for their (and their department's) actions, and where this can be shown to be less than the expected level of excellence, then they can be forced to pay those that lost out.",
