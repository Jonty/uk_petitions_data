            "background": "make all hospitals have full staff 7 days a week instead of mon-fri. because if your unfortunate enough to be taken ill on a fri for instance, any tests you may have wont be assessed by a doctor untill the following monday, unless its \"classed\" as an emergency. this needs to change for 2 reasons. 1,in some cases the patient will be given the all clear & allowed home, thus making extra beds availible to a more deserving soul that will otherwise be used for no good reason. & 2,it is surely better for the patient to be assessed immidiately (scan results for instance) as a life threatening condition can be diagnosed 48 hours sooner than the current system allows. the other emergency services give full cover 24/7, hospitals should too. after all,if you have car crash or have a stroke, you dont get to choose the day of week to have it on. sign this petition because one day your life may depend on it.",
