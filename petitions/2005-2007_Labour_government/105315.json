            "background": "Britain's libel laws are amongst the most restrictive and inequitable to found in any Western liberal democracy - so bad that even Americans now come to the UK to sue for libel - and amount to no more than the privatisation of censorship.\n\nWe call for them to be amended in line with approach to libel adopted by the US, in which the burden of proof lies the accuser and not the defendent - as is the case in the UK - and to ensure that Britian's libel laws support and facilitate free expression and do not act to suppress the expression of legitimately held opinion and dissent.",
