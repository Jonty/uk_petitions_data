            "background": "The BBC should always remain independent from government and business influence. As a broadcaster, it is vital as a trusted source of news and information throughout the world, and should never be unduly influenced by the demands of party politicians or 'the market'. The public good must come first, and the British public have a right to unbiased, critical reportage.\n\nThe BBC should be held to its Public Service Broadcasting (PSB) remit: to produce high-quality news, drama, sport, documentary and factual programmes. The Corporation should deliver innovative, thoughtful and educational broadcasting, rather than pursue ratings and corporate rebranding exercises. BBC Radio and World Service operations should be guaranteed to continue in their present form - whilst ensuring that they measure up to their PSB remit.\n\nThe BBC should be enshrined in UK law as an independent broadcaster, working in the public interest for the greater benefit of all citizens; it should never be constrained by governmental or commercial pressures.",
