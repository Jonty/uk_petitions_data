            "background": "The DTI is taking back \u00a368M from the UK research councils to pay for \"exceptional\" and ongoing costs resulting from the collapse of the Rover car company and the unexpected increase in support needed to cover British Energy's nuclear liabilities. This is short-sighted, damaging to the UK's critically-important research base, and sets a dangerous precedent. Instead, Government support for research should be removed from the DTI and given to a department that will not raid research funds to pay for an unrelated shortfall.",
