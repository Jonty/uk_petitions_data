        "background": "Whilst travelling in Europe, a group of friends came across a unique brand of pub game - 'Nail Wood'. Ingenious Europeans had acquired a heavy log and placed in a pub. Said Europeans then supplied nails and a hammer. The aim of the game was to hammer a nail into the log, hence, 'Nail Wood'.\n\nI have yet to play this game because of the archaic British rules about pubs, nails, wood and hammers.\n\nPetition the PM to licence this adrenalin packed pub game.\n\nWARNING: CREATOR OF PETITION NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INJURIES SUSTAINED THROUGH PEOPLE ATTMEPTING TO PLAY ILLEGAL 'NAIL WOOD' AT HOME.",
