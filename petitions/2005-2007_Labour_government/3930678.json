        "action": "Introduce annual leases for social housing tenants so that those in social housing larger than they need can be moved to smaller properties",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There are waiting lists around the country full of parents with small children who are unable to move into a house suitable for their size of family. At the same time, there are 3,4 and 5 bedroom houses with 1 or 2 occupants. They clearly had a need for these houses when they had younger children; but should now be moved out to a smaller property that suits their current need.  An annual lease would allow local authorities to assess the continued suitability of each claimant; thus allowing larger properties to be freed up for those who actually NEED a larger house. This would improve the quality of life for those children stuck in small flats, sharing with multiple siblings sometimes of the opposite gender whilst properties with the necessary number of bedrooms are taken up by people who no longer need the space.",
