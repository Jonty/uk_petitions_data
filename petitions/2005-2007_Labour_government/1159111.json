            "background": "The current system of evaluating existing Incapacity Benefit cases is ridiculous. The decision is centered around a Personal Capabilty Assessment, where you are given 10 minutes to convince a state picked doctor of your inabilities, not only is this a de-humanising experience, particularly when the participants illness is of an embarrassing nature as in my case, but is also open to manipulation from both sides. Decisions on a claimants health and abilities to work should center on their medical records and more continuous contact between claimant and state, this would help eradicate fraud, while also better protecting the vulnerable.",
