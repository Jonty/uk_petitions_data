            "action": "instruct Bristol City Council and other councils to scrap the system whereby parents are forced to pay for children's swimming lessons during the school holidays, even when children do not attend.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This system is becoming prevalent throughout the country, as more and more local authorities sell off the running of their Leisure Centres to private companies such as SLM, who run the Bristol pools. Previously there were lessons for schoolchildren in the term only but since October in Bristol, they run throughout the school holidays and if you miss a lesson because you are away, you do not get a refund. If you choose not to pay for the holiday period, you risk losing your place in the class and could miss months of lessons. This system is unfair and forces people to pay \u00a345.10 extra per child per year. It penalises the less well-off. It also reduces the time available for family, public and intensive course swimming during the holidays. In spite of a petition and numerous meetings, SLM and  Bristol City Council are not listening to the needs of the pool users. The council say the new scheme is an improvement - it is not. It is not natural to commit to anything for 50 weeks a year and we should not be forced to pay for something we don't want.",
