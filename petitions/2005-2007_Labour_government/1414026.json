As it stands New/Young drivers are able to purchase/drive/modify vehicles with high power outputs before they have learnt the art of responsible driving. I believe that by restricting the horsepower/engine size of vehicles used by new drivers as is already done with motorcycles we can noticably reduce road death and serious injury to drivers, passengers and pedestrians.",
