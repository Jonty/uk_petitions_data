        "background": "360s are failing all over the globe in massive quantity. Microsoft don't want to know. They have no complaints department and no accountability. Consumers world wide are up in arms, and Microsoft simply state that there 'is no problem' while charging massive repair rates for machinery that is inherently faulty, in such vast number that it could almost be by design.\nAs consumers we need protection from companies who create poor and unreliable product, and as such, I propose that Microsoft are forced to open an inquiry into the serious hardware flaws in their product, including numbers effected and the source of the problems, and that this information may be made publicly available.",
