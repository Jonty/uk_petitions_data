            "background": "Mr Blair's response to over 1.7 million members of the British public against road charging is quite disturbing.\n\nThe enviromental card...? An extra terminal at Heathrow and Stansted? Excessive road widening? More cars imported? Train and bus fares raised when the quality of service is falling? Congestion charging revenue not returned to transport?\n \nAllegedly, it will cost a conservative estimate of \u00a360 billion to create, \u00a310 billion a year to maintain and at least \u00a3600 pounds needed from every driver. Thatcher got poll tax riots as her swansong legacy. If the government push forward on this, the amount of campaigners in the street won't leave room for a bike, let alone a car.\n \nMr Blair's email response of February 21st 2007 does no longer wash. The spin has spun and the people have had enough.",
