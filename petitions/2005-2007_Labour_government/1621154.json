This is to hold a VALID CBT Certificate.\n\nSince it's introduction, the Motorcycle CBT has helped reduce the number of accidents involving Motorcyclists.  If everyone taking a Car Test was to hold a Valid CBT, then we might see a reduction of New Car Driver incidents.  Even by taking the CBT, you are getting better road awareness skills, which you don't get through driving alone.",
