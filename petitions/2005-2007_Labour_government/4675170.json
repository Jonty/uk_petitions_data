            "background": "Bus travel costs have increased dramatically in several boroughs for young children and this is a burden on their families, especally the low income. You want to encourage us to use public transport so please pay for public transport for the people in full education up to 18 and allow parents to travel free with children Monday to Friday 8-5. This will reduce the amount of gas guzzlers and problems in the morning school run.",
