Added to that, UK weather patterns have noticeably altered, (probably due to increase in Earth tilt,ozone depletion and ice melt). It makes sense now to stop this environmentally unfriendly celebration which results each year in worsening of asthma and other breathing problems during the two weeks surrounding Nov 5th. Otherwise how can the UK claim to be aiming to reduce carbon emissions?",
