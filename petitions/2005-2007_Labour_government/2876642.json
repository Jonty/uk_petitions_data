        "background": "Throughout the country, people with average or lower than average incomes account for the vast majority of traffic on the roads. The conjestion they cause is to the detriment of higher wage earners who have more economically important business to attend to than the lower paid road users. Higher taxes relating to personal transport would get the poor back on public transport, where they belong, and free up the road network to allow more convenient and relaxing motoring for the better off members of society.",
