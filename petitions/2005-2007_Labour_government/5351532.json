            "background": "The best interests of the child it has been argued, is to deny even decent parents a legal right to contact with them.\nWe want to confront that assumption, which does seem intuitively incorrect doesn't it, as most parents surely seek to protect their child and seek their wellbeing too. \nParents failing to agree on contact arrangements creates a situation where one or other of them can have their role in the child's life jeopardised at any time without any fault on their part.\nWe believe that parents have legitimate interests that should be considered regarding their children, and they should not be made to suffer exclusion from their lives where this can be avoided.",
