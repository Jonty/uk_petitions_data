The point had also been made that the congestion charge is there to encourage people to use public transport. how can you use public transport when you're a contractor or plumber? you cant take your tools or materials on the bus or underground! to me London is as congested as it was back 5 or 6 years. furthermore, if u want to take our money, please use it on a worthwhile cause. like improving road quality. or creating new roads to act as valves when roads get too busy.",
