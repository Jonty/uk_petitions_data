            "background": "Sharks are slow growing apex predators, they are a vital part of the ecosystem's balance (paradoxically helping support commercial fish stocks by keeping the balance). Millions of sharks are killed each year for the Chinese restaurant industry worldwide. Shark populations globally are in steep decline. Shark Fin soup is not a cultural dish it is a recent trend / status symbol. We call on the government to restrict the market for this destructive fishery by either banning or taxing the sale/import/export of shark fin. This would send a positive message worldwide if the buying stops the killing will too.",
