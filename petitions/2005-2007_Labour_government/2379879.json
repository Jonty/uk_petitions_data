In a democratic society like ours, we must be allowed to see the opposing vote.\n\nSome would argue that you can create a seperate, opposing petition, but we all know that organisations with deep pockets and marketing clout would be able to skew the result and weblink only to  the petition they favour. It would be so much fairer for every petitioner to choose in favour or against a particular petition. So this petition is to change the petition process. Please sign up if you agree. Unfortunately, if you don't agree you will have no voice here. (not fair is it).",
