This suspension will allow the Home Office to concentrate on Illegals already in the country without having to divide their resources with new applications etc. Lets spend 12 months or so clearing out all those who should not be here and then start afresh with a clearer picture and fresh impetous. We cannot go on losing illegals into our communities week after week. Our public services are stretched to the limit, there is a question over disease etc being brought in by illegals and it is time it was all put under control.",
