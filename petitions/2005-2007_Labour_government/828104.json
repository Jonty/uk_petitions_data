            "background": "Richard Beeching closed many railways during the 60's. Since then the amount of traffic on the roads has escalated dramatically creating pollution problems and congestion like noone could have foreseen. Its time the PM looked into reintroducing some of the cut lines, developing greater capacity, or building new. One trainload is a fair number of lorry loads; it would then require only short distance haulage by lorries to the customers door. This would help but down on emissions and give a better transport network. Some parts of the country are totally without rail transport, some service would be better than none and give people who rely on public transport a wider scope on where they can go.",
