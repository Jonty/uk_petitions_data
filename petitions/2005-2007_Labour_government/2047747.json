        "background": "Road pricing is an excessive, Big Brother means to an environmental end.\n\nTaxing vehicles at point-of-purchase according to fuel efficiency and similarly through fuel duty, as is currently done, is perfectly effective in providing clear incentives to use cleaner cars.\n\nIt just needs to be used properly.\n\nWatching where everyone drives through an incredibly expensive surveillance system is not. Scrap this - spend the money saved on public transport instead.",
