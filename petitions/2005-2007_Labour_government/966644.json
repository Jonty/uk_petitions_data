            "background": "Marching around at 140 paces a minute, creating visual displays while controlling breathing and the ability to play an instrument, the experience is exhausting and requires true effort and is competitive. So why, if darts and bowling can be counted as sports, aren't bands officially recognised? \n\nWe do work for the community, and teach youngsters from the age of 8 how to play instruments and they are supplied. For someone who is interestered in music rather than football, I'm bullied as many others are and banding doesn't cause the spread of antisocial behaviour between players and supporters as sports such as football do.\n\nI do much more physical work in my 10+ hours a week with rehearsals and competitions than an hour after school playing football, yet I can't do band for my Duke of Edingburgh Physical. Please give banding the promotion it deserves!",
