            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Motor insurance is legally compulsory, yet motorists must purchase from the private sector i.e. profit seeking organisations. This means motorists do not pay a fair premium on the one element they are bound to as the majority do not have third party only cover and are paying distorted premium levels based on irrelevant theft / malicious vandalism rating factors such as postcode and security of where the vehicle is stored - prejudicing aginst urban motorists, and those in less affluent areas. As private sector insurers do not want motorists to have only third party cover for obvious commercial reasons, they will either not offer standalone cover, or offer cover at deliberately uncompetitive levels. This is against the public interest, and misrepresents the intent of laws passed under the Road Traffic Act by the government. Furthermore, profit pricing encourages those who cannot readily afford insurance to drive without - raising premiums still further for everybody else.",
