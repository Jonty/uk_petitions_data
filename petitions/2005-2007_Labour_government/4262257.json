            "background": "Next Year, 200 years will have passed since the abolition of Slavery.  Yet today, Carers work very long hours for next to nothing.  The Carers allowance is only payable to people who earn less than \u00a387 per week.  Carers allowance is only \u00a348.65p per week.  Carers save the Country tens of Millions of Pounds each year and it is about time that their sacrifices were recognised.  \u00a32000 per year will not make a significant difference to the lives of carers, but it will go some way to compensate carers for the long hours with little help that carers put in.  This one off Annual payment should be tax free, and free of means testing.  It should also be on top of any Income support recieved to make up their carers allowance.",
