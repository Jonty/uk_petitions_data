It should be made clear that all citizens pay for the roads from general taxation.  With this in mind the public at large should welcome spending more money to provide better cycling facilities and make the use of the bicycle safer and more practical for everyday short journeys.  We have a great deal to learn from some countries. Denmark in particular, have increased cycling substantially in recent years, particularly with school journeys, which have increased from 3% to 50%.",
