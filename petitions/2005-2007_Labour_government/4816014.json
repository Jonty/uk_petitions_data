        "background": "This petition is to:\n- Simplify the taxation system making it simpler and cheaper for individuals and businesses to comply.  A simple system has less room for loopholes.\n- Overhaul the taxation system (local tax included) and how things are paid for. Reducing the waste, and burden on public funds as to what gets public money.\n- Reduce the general taxation burden on the economy, by reducing the demand on public funds and moving to a more \"pay as you use\" principle.\n- Make it tougher to claim benefits\n- Long-term incentives for not claiming benefits\n- Allow NHS to claim costs back from individuals that deliberately inflict costs on it (e.g. purpotrators of violence, reckless drivers, negligence at work leading to accidents etc.)\n\nThe current system is expensive and cumbersome.  The overriding objective is to improve the efficiency and fairness of the taxation system, whilst reducing the cost to individuals, businesses, and the economy alike.",
