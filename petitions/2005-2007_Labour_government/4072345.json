            "background": "That Robert Mugabe is a holder of this award is an insult to the title.  He has demonstrated time and time again that he is totally unworthy of such honour.  Robert Mugabe was created an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1994 by Queen Elizabeth II under the advice of the then government.  Those were very different times.  He has now shown his true colours in the reckless and tyrannical way he rules Zimbabwe.  He constantly derides the United Kingdom.  This government should advise Her Majesty to remove Mugabe from the Order of the Bath.",
