            "background": "Having Watched the Panorama Program \"Please Look After Mum\"on the 12/2/07 and having looked after elderly parents myself,I  am disgusted that elderly people in Great Britain(a first world country)have less protection then animals have under the Law. If an animal is mistreated the RSPCA will take the person to court, no such protection for ederly people.As a 67 year old faceing old age If I go into a nursing home I would hope to be treated with care and respect(no such luck according to this program).If the Law Commissions proposed 1995 Legislation or something simular is not implemented, then our elderly will carry on being abused and neglected, and that is appalling for a civilised country in the 21 Century.",
