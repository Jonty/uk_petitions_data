            "background": "The current systemis flawed in that you can be caught 4 times with no increase in penalty to the errant motorist before a ban comes into place, to ensure drivers learn from there poor driving i suggest changing the system to a \u00a3100 fine for the first ofence with a 3 months ban , this would be doubled with any subsequent offence, ie 2nd offence \u00a3200 and 6 months ban, 3rd offence \u00a3400 and 12 months ban, 4th offence \u00a3800 fine and 24 months ban and on and on, i believe this type of punishment would deter all speeders who put the lives of others at risk.",
