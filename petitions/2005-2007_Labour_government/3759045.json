All to often people don't bother to read them because of this.\nIf there was a law which required that the warnings were of at least 12 point text or larger then there would be fewer accidents due to people not reading the warnings first. In other words get rid of all the small print in the world! especially contractual documents. If it has to be said, make it readable!",
