            "background": "Thousands of greyhounds each year suffer at the hands of the British greyhound racing industry. \n\nThe industry itself has admitted that 500 - 1,000 retired greyhounds are put to death every year. This alone would be enough to justify a ban on greyhound racing, but the true figure for retired dogs killed is far, far higher. Quite possibly as many as 6,000 each year.\n\nMany ex-racing greyhounds are simply abandoned and a large number are killed, sometimes by extremely cruel methods such as drowning or poisoning, because some owners and trainers are not prepared to pay the cost of having them put to sleep by a vet.\n\nThere is only one way to effectively end this suffering  - introduce legislation to bring an end to all forms of greyhound racing within the UK.\n\n(figures quote from: www.greyhoundaction.org.uk)",
