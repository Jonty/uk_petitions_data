        "action": "ask the Treasury to reconsider its decision on new prison funding, reported on 17 February 2007",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "It is not prudent to authorise the funding of two new prisons and not at the same time authorise funding for their lifetime running costs and their eventual demolition. It appears that the Treasury is trying to use uncertainty over lifetime funding to make the Home Office change its mind about building the prisons in the first place. The Government should provide the required prison capacity before it is needed, not afterwards. In my opinion, if insufficient funds are available they should be raised by a 50% income tax rate, introduced at the highest possible threshold level.",
