The remaining qualified staff will be stripped of their professional status, with half on much reduced pay. This would, over time, represent the complete de-professionalisation of the service as experienced by Hampshire library users, inevitably resulting in a worse service and unreasonable pressure on remaining staff. \nWe believe Hampshire residents deserve a quality service, delivered by quality staff that includes qualified information professionals.",
