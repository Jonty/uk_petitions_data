        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Please cancel the order for 2 CVF ships. They're inferior to even old American aircraft carrier classes like the Forrestal class. We  ask that you order the USS John F. Kennedy, to be delivered by 2012, when RO6 concludes service.\nThis aircraft carrier will outperform the CVF ships if they'll be commissioned. It's range is significantly longer than that of the CVF ships, and it is significantly faster. It can also carry as much aircraft as the CVF ships combined - approximately 85. The Kennedy's angled flight deck is long enough for the F-35B to take off without the need to install a ski-jump. It is true that the catapults and arresting gears of the Kennedy are faulty, but they aren't needed, because the F-35B is a STOVL plane, and the deck is long enough for it to take off even without using a ski jump. It is true that more crew would be required to man the ship than both CVF vessels combined, however this could be easily done by hiring, if the government balanced the budget.",
