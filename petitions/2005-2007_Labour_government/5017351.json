Simply put, the long term problem is not the plight of the citizens, it's the actions of those in power. In most of the poverty-ridden regions of Africa, the age of warlords has never truly gone away - Mugabe, the Congo, Somalia, the Darfur region, and going back to the Genocide of 1994. When the warbands are crushed, and the people given a more beneficial system of rule - republics, democracies, whichever - more goes to the people & not just to the select few in charge. Sending more foreign aid until this happens is pointless, as we're just feeding the warbands.",
