        "background": "With the G-8 report upcoming, it's time for a different, possibly more controversial policy for helping Africa. Simply put, the long term problem is not the plight of the citizens, it's the actions of those in power. In most of the poverty-ridden regions of Africa, the age of warlords has never truly gone away - Mugabe, the Congo, Somalia, the Darfur region, and going back to the Genocide of 1994. When the warbands are crushed, and the people given a more beneficial system of rule - republics, democracies, whichever - more goes to the people & not just to the select few in charge. Sending more foreign aid until this happens is pointless, as we're just feeding the warbands.",
