            "background": "if all packaging had a clear, understanable recycling colour code,for example plastic that may be reused had a yellow symbol...cans had a blue symbol...glass had a red one ect. then everyone would be able to seperate all goods that could be reused with great ease. this would encourage more people to recycle, reduce the cost of seperating the items,decrease the amount of waste and more importantly raise awareness of this issue. many people still do not recycle as they are not sure what can be recycled and face fines if they put a product in the wrong box/bag ect. this system would allieviate this problem..wouldn't you agree?",
