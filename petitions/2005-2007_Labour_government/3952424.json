            "background": "I am in Liverpool, Capital of Culture 2008. They are making so many changes to public transport, mostly regarding the withdrawal of 'kneeling' buses, in my local area I am finding it impossible to travel with my daughter in her pushchair. I can't even imagine the difficulties those in wheelchairs face, just to perform everday tasks like travelling to/from work and shopping. There is a drive to encourage people to use public transport rather than their cars. How is this possible when people (inclding those with babies and young children) are being forced to use taxis or cars? They are being isolated because they cannot physically board a bus! It will also have an impact on the Capital of Culture celebrations because if people visit our City in a wheelchair/pram-how will they get around? Action needs to be taken to promote equality in the forthcoming Capital of Culture City and the bus companies don't seen to be concerned so this is the next step.",
