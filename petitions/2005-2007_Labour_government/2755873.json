        "background": "I understand that the Dartford Tunnel and Queen Elizabeth Bridge construction costs have been paid up for a few years.\nThe Toll booths are a bottle-neck to free traffic flow and cause serious hold-ups in both directions, last Nov it took 2 hours from the M20 to the Toll booths a distance of about 5 miles.\nThe pollution to the local area from fumes, clutch and brake dust(high asbestos content) and noise is not acceptable environmentally. \nI propose that the existing 50mph speed limits be rigorously enforced for safety reasons",
