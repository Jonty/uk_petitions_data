The continued loss of preferences and a changing global political system has forgotten this part of the world. It is time, just as France has done for its former African Colonies, that the Britain stands to defend the rights of her former colonies. While Africa needs assistance, the Caribbean and its contributions must not be forgotten. Help us take a stand, help us to develop.",
