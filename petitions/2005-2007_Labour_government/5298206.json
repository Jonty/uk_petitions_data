I have a quote I use and it helps me with my protest,\n\"Horses Took Us To War And What Do We Do? Take Them To Slaughter\"\nI Know horse slaughtering is a job for many people and pays. But money isnt ment to be made by killing animals. Slaughter being stopped may cause a major cost to socity but it isn't right! Please Act Now To Stop Slaughter!\n\nThink of a horse running free.\nThen Think Of A Horse Being Led Threw A Mincer!\n\nIts Your Choice....\n Thank You xx",
