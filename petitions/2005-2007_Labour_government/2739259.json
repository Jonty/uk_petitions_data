            "background": "We endeavour to have a simple Declaration of Friendship Pact between our two communities and ask both town councils to abide by the wishes of the Towns People. We further ask our Councils and Mayors to represent the Twin Towns communities and our Mayors to lead the way. This is not a political issue and would not normally require the intervention of our Government. Although we have asked for this simple declaration for over ten years now and are no closer to our goal, Kinsale are unanimous in its intentions yet Barry still hold back. Why ?  Anything political is internal and fighting within local Government should not prevent the wishes of the people occur. We only ask for a simple Declaration of Friendship, and ask for support to unite further two towns with historic, family and strong links at no cost. Surely all friendships in modern times can only be for the common good and should proceed with all haste and deserve full support of all. Thankyou in advance for your support.",
