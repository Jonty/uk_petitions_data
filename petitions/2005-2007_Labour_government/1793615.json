It baffles me that we are STILL getting ripped off by the multi-million pounds profit maker when it should be included within my digital viewing package. I think its totally wrong to be RIPPED OFF in this way!! We should be given the choice to OPT OUT when we take on the digital contract! DO YOU AGREE? have your say and sign up NOW!!",
