Just because my parents work dosnt mean there willing to give out \u00a330 a week to me! My parents have two children in college and get no help what so ever with transport, dinners ect. I'm finding it hard to get a job and because of that i dont get to go out with my friends as much who actually get EMA. I do exactly the same as every other person in my college so why should they get EMA and others dont? It isnt fair! It have taken a potition around colleges in my area and i plan on taking it outside colleges aswell. Please Sign.",
