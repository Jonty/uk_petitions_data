            "background": "im in college and i think its disguisting that myself and others dont recieve EMA because our parents get off their backsides and work for the money they earn. Just because my parents work dosnt mean there willing to give out \u00a330 a week to me! My parents have two children in college and get no help what so ever with transport, dinners ect. I'm finding it hard to get a job and because of that i dont get to go out with my friends as much who actually get EMA. I do exactly the same as every other person in my college so why should they get EMA and others dont? It isnt fair! It have taken a potition around colleges in my area and i plan on taking it outside colleges aswell. Please Sign.",
