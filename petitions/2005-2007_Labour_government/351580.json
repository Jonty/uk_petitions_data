It should be made clear that all citizens pay for the roads from general taxation.  With this in mind the public at large should welcome spending more money to provide better cycling facilities and make the use of the bicycle safer and more practical for everday short journies.  We have a great deal to learn from some countries. Denmark in in paticular, have increased cycling substantialy in recent years,particularly with school journies which have increased from 3% 50%.",
