            "background": "Extend HE funding to those over 50 who have been unemployed or on incapacity benefit/income support for over 12 months. Currently those who already hold a first degree from a UK University are ineligible for financial help towards course fees. A degree taken over 25 years ago, is no longer relevant in today's job market. Pursuing a further degree or postgraduate qualification would enable them to come off benefits and be of more value to the community.",
