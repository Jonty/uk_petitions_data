        "background": "Many times in the papers now, we hear of \"political correctness\" gone wrong, and how human rights impedes things such as prisoners - in fact, one article mentioned an institute for young offenders using their funding to buy luxuries like televisions and new games consoles...\nI was always taught as a child, that with rights, come responsibilities. If people act irresponsibly, they should lose rights. It is my FIRM belief that being tough on criminals in this manner would cut crime. If a repeat offender for instance, lost the right to early release for good behaviour, or other things of this nature, they would be less likely to re-offend.\nPlace rights hand-in-hand with responsibility, where they should have been all along.\nJail should be jail. Criminals should be criminals. Justice should be justice. \nGive us justice.\nGive us rights.\nGive us responsibility.",
