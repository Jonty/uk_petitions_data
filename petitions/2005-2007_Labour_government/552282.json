            "background": "Increasingly, performance aftermarket exhausts are being fitted to motor vehicles and motorbikes. Many of these exhausts are extremely noisly and can ruin the peace, and cause fright. A simple decibel level check on exhausts at MOT should be included in the MOT procedure to prevent the use of these exhausts. The current MOT requirement states that exhausts must not be overly noisy. This is ineffective and open to abuse.",
