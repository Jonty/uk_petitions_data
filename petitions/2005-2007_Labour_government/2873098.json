            "background": "We all grew up finding our own way through life, I believe if we were all taught more than just sex education in schools it would have made us confident mature adults today.\n\nRather than french, spanish etc kids should be taught how to live life after education. Deal with the needs of their future kids hygiene, mental and physical needs.\nBeing a supportive partner and balancing the cost of living, avoiding debt, paying bills, motgages etc.\n\nThis could all make a differance, if our children were to know the truth about what lays ahead they may take education more seriously and keep teenage pregnancies down. \n\nIf our children had a better understanding about what their parents are up against they may help and respect us more rather than waste their lives away.\n\nOur kids must be shown a clear picture about reality to help them cut back on mistakes and plan better for the future. \n\nWhat do you think?",
