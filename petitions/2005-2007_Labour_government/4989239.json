            "background": "We express our deep distress and outrage at the plight of Iraqi academics and their lack of protection in the face of a systematic campaign of assassination. We should not stand idly by while our colleagues are murdered with impunity. \n\nWe express our profound concern at the wholesale destruction of Iraq's higher-education system and the climate of fear that is emptying Iraq of its intellectual capital. \n\nWe urge the British Government to do all it can to protect Iraqi Academics and Iraq from this devastating loss from which it could take generations to recover;\n\nWe urge the British Government to take the lead in facilitating links between Iraqi Academics, in Iraq and in excile, and higher education and research institutions and peers in the middle east and the UK. Facilitating mechanisms should be established in collaboration with the appropriate bodies and higher education institutions and networks, and the necessary level of financial provision should be ensured.",
