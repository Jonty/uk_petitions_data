            "background": "I believe it is wrong to allow large numbers of foreign workers access to the UK labour market on the pretence that they will do the jobs that we will not do, they may initially do that but then they will progress on to better paid jobs denying UK citizens access to those jobs. I also believe allowing large number of foreign workers into the UK is causing resentment and unrest among the rest of the UK population.",
