This is not only problematic for the transexual, transgendered, intersexed, genderqueer and other gender non-normative people but also for people who simply do not wish to disclose their gender.\nThere are very few places where gender/sex is necessary to know and this would save a lot of people a lot of embarrassment and be a relief to those of us who never know the right box to tick.",
