            "background": "It is widely understood that Mr. Blair will be resigning as Prime Minister before the end of the full term of office, as given to him by the electorate. Mr. Blair's local constituents elected him as their local Member of Parliament. The Country, via the outcome of the national vote, elected him as the Prime Minister. Mr. Brown, widely held to succeed Mr. Blair, was also elected as a local Member of Parliament by his constituents, but was not voted by the national electorate to be Prime Minister. In a democracy, it is surely right and proper that every electorate should have a vote regarding both their local representative in parliament and the Prime Minister, whom represents them on the national and international political stage.",
