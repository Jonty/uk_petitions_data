Blair has restored economy to so many people and given this country a chance it had lost.\n\nBlair should not be bullied and pushed into resigning. Thatcher made that error and it was a bad one. \n\nBlair is needed to further the plans he started, especially reform in the Lords and Buckingham Palace; Local Government; and education.\n\nStand by Blair, tell him to stay.",
