        "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\nWe would like to suggest that establishing a completely new body of a General Pharmaceutical Council (GPC) analogous to the medical profession's independent regulatory General Medical Council (GMC) will be costly \nto new pharmacist like myself and newly qualified pharmacists who will \nhave marked rise in annual retention fees to fund an additional body. \nMay I suggest that it would be a far better idea for both individual \npharmacist and the government if both GMC and the newly proposed GPC were \nto merge to become a General Medical and Pharmaceutical Council (GMPC) \nso that costs could be distributed fairly and  the wider scope of \nregulating both health professions (Doctors and Pharmacist) are served to \nprotect the public in mind. The existing GMC roles should include the \nregulation of pharmacist and become the base of regulation for both health \nprofessions as  it has many  years of experience of strict and \nstringent independent regulation.",
