            "background": "Banks and Building societies are putting undue presure on families who have had their home re-possessed by selling off at auction. This usually results in homes being sold at well below market value. The Banks/Building societies then bombard the original owner to make up the shortfall. This must be stopped. If a home is re-possessed, then it surely is the Bank/Building societies duty to get the best possible price and so allow those that have lost their homes to repay the debt and live a life without being hounded by companies which are making millions from other peoples misery.",
