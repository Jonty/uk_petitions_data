        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Now that the restrictions have been lifted for Mr Bernard Matthews and his global empire, we would like those normal poultry keepers within the area to be allowed to get back to normal and for the restrictions placed upon them to be lifted.  BM lorries are driving past ordinary poultry keepers homes and land and this is rubbing the noses of ordinary folk who keep poultry, either for a hobby or as a business.\nAfter all, it was not down to back yard poultry that this latest avian flu arrived in the UK.\nIf Bernard Matthews is allowed to get back \"to normal\" and start trading again then it is only fair that others are too.",
