        "background": "The International Council for the Exploration of the Seas (ICES) has for the past few years recommended 'ZERO' catch for Spurdog (Squalus acanthias) listed as 'Critical' and Porbeagle Shark (Lamna Nasus), listed as 'Vulnerable' on the IUCN red list. This advice, which is directed at the seas around the EU and UK, has been consistently ignored by the UK and the EU Governments. Both species recently failed to gain an Appendix ii listing with CITES due to data deficiency and because there is no Fisheries Management plan in operation in our waters for them. Fishing for Spurdog and Porbeagle should be suspended until at least such time that a UK plan is in place and can show that stocks have recovered enough to confirm their sustainability before fishing for them should recommence.",
