            "background": "Instead of taxing people in this country in ever increasing ways ie. air fuel tax, when we are already one of the most enviromenatly sound countries in the world. Tax goods manufactured in coutries that are not reducing their enviromental impact.\nChina and USA are two of the worst poluting countries in the world, tax everything manufactured in these countries by 10% and there will be 3 effects.\n1st; these countries taxed will start to make an effot to reduce carbon output instead of ignoring it as this tax hits them where it hurts, loss of money.\n2nd; UK companies will begin to source products locally which will begin to rebuild our manufacturing base as it will be cheaper to buy locally than import it.\n3rd; Further reduction of carbon worldwide as we will stop having to import most of our products by ship or aircraft so their use worldwide will be reduced.\n\nThere will be even greater impact if this is taken up by the EU and not just the UK.",
