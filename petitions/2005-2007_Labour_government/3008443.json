            "background": "Did you know, schools in England use approximately 5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions a year. We carried out a survey on our school, and the amount of energy used is 960,000 kWh every year. Around 25% of this energy is wasted in inefficient facilities. Schools need to start schemes to help the enviroment, and considering that many hundreds of people attend one place, the issue can be raised with large numbers of people, especially the younger generation who will face the problems in the future. \nWe are two students from a school in England aiming to address this issue and the fact that schools really are not doing enough to help our environment. Please help us by signing this petition to help us get more support.",
