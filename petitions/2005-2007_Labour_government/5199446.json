            "background": "The goverment is restructuring the Ambulance Service without consulting the\npublic or the operational staff.These changes will result in\nA&E  Ambulances losing a qualified and trained member of staff.\n\nThese will be replaced by a driver trained to drive under\nemergency conditions,and with basic first aid skills.\n\n(ECA-read as Community Support Officer,EMT-read as Police Constable)\n\nIt is being rushed through, with little thought being given to training or the future. \n\nAt present, every Ambulance,(except for\ntrial areas), is staffed by a minimum of 2 Emergency Medical Technicians.\n**(There is supposed to be a Paramedic on each ,this will soon be a minimum of 2 ECAs,but only in exceptional circumstances. Excepetional circumstances means when we run out of Paramedic crews to send.\nThis is everyday**\nIt will not mean more ambulances are available.\n\nParamedics will burn out very quickly,and recruitment/retention will suffer rapidly.\n\nAnd people will die...\n\nAs a Paramedic you cannot do your job properly without a properly trained colleague.\nPlease think about what you are doing to our Emergency\nServices, this will be a massive step backwards.",
