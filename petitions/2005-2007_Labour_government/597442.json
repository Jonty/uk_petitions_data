            "background": "religious leaders have long abused their influence and power in society to excersise control over people and force religion upon people. it is a persons basic human right to choose which religion, if any, they want to follow. so called \"faith schools\" promote the extremeism of each religion in their teachings there.  it is high time that we as a country started to move towards a secular society, where religion carries no currency, and decisions can be made through rational thinking and judgement rather than with the weight of todays religious community breathing down the governments neck.",
