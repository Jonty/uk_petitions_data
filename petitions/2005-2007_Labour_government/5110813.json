            "background": "Tamworth is a town with has about 58 underpasses, many are now completely unnecessary. With the exception of a few they now only serve attract anti-social behaviour and vandalism causing misery for neighbours and residents alike. As a result of this anti-social behaviour many are no longer used by residents.\n\nThe underpasses in Tamworth belong to Staffordshire County Council and they do not make funding available for the underpasses to be filled in.\n\nTherefore we are asking the government to make funding available for a project to remove as many of the unwanted underpasses in Tamworth as possible, using public consultation to target the most unwanted. Removing many of the underpasses from our housing estates will have a marked improvement on the quality of life in Tamworth and will also serve to reduce crime in Tamworth.",
