            "background": "Secondary schools are suffering a chronic shortage of maths and science teachers. At the same time thousands of adults with a good knowledge of maths and science are unemployed or underemployed due to a downturn in the engineering and IT industry. Many of these people would like to teach maths and science but can't because gaining the teaching qualifications is too difficult or expensive for them due to family and financial commitments. \n\nI propose that the government changes legislation to allow people to become secondary school maths and science teachers without having to hold teaching qualifications, providing they hold a higher qualification related to the subject they want to teach. New recruits will undertake a short (less than 3 months) course in teaching free of charge by their LEA.",
