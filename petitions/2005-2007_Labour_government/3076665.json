            "background": "With the ongoing worldwide concern over global warming, the excessive use of fossil fuels and the search for clean renewable energy sources - the proposed use of lignite in a powerstation is lunacy.  Not only does the use of lignite create intolerable amounts of waste - obtaining lignite is also one of the most destructive forms of mining.  The proposed lignite mining in the Ballymoney area will destroy the local environment and detrimentally affect the wider environment including Scotland & Northern England, with the dust fallout from the planned powerstation.  Safeguards are needed, and must be guaranteed, to prevent this violation of the landscape and the wider area from this totally unneccessary mining operation.",
