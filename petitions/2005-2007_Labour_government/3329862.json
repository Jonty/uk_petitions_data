            "background": "As you aware Manchester has been awarded the sole regional casino. However, due to the economic plight of the popular seaside town, Blackpool I offer this petition to try and get a second regional casino. The award would make sense as the town was the popular choice and would enable the many visitors that Blackpool receives each year to have an extra dimension to their stay. The town was banking on the award of the casino to regenerate and to survive; the decision has potentially put at risk Blackpool's very existence as the popular tourist attraction this country knows and loves.",
