            "background": "It seems to me that the main reason for a woman to become pregnant is in order to have a child.  Once a couple find they have difficulty in conceiving the automatic reaction seems to be to seek fertility treatment; adoption, if considered at all, seems to be seen very much as second-best/\"I suppose we'll have to if it's the only way to have a child\".  There are any number of children in \"Homes\" suffering unloved childhoods at best and actual abuse at worst; why not give them a chance of a loving childhood?  Each of us has only one chance at childhood and if it was abusive or unhappy we can be affected by this for the rest of our lives.  Since the aim is to have a child why does it seem so important to do so by the route of pregnancy and birth?",
