        "background": "Current tax breaks on employee car parking spaces could be removed in this year's Budget.\n\nThis would mean that even if you don't have a company car and have to pay for your own car and fuel to travel to work, parking at work for free would become a benefit in kind and therefore taxable.\n\nSince a lot of us travel to work by car due to the lack to public transport available this is just another tax on the motorist. Those of us who live in small towns but work a long way from home will be penalized because of a lack of public transport.",
