I payed to go to digital on Freesat/Freeview because the government want us all to (and I had really dodgy reception!)\n\nPlease Prime Minister, If the FA need the money from SKY to run there business - stop paying the players so much money to play for their country! They should pay for the privilidge and the pride and the honour of it anyway! They get paid enough Monday to Friday (so to speak).\n\nThe English public deserve to watch 'their' team on the license fee paid Beeb.\n\nThe same really goes for ANY English team performance in ANY sport where our country is represented. (but more so football as it is the 'most watched' game/sport we have.\n\nI will however, not hold my breath.",
