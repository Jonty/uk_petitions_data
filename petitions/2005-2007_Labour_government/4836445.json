            "background": "Stop taxing the life out of us, governments are very greedy they seem to want every penny off us, they tax the clothes we wear, the food we eat, the cars we buy, need I go on, it isnt enough to tax our basic pay they have to tax overtime, holiday pay, berevment pay, one day our off takes will be more than our pay.\nI think that we are coming very close to a dictatorship nation, my petition is for this and all governments is to ease off on the working class, if it wasnt for us there would be no work done, then where would they get the taxes from.\nAlso my petition is to stop ministers on the band wagon from giving themselves pay rises far above the rate of inflation and at the same time telling companys to keep pay rises down.",
