        "background": "The aim of this petition is to protect traditional nursery rhymes by preventing the teaching and publication of altered versions such as 'Baa Baa White Sheep', 'Baa Baa Rainbow Sheep' or 'Baa Baa Green Sheep'. Such revised versions may not perform the functions of catharsis for children, or allow them to imaginitively deal with violence and danger. Also, a society as a whole may be the poorer for it, because it loses opportunities to discuss obsolete values.",
