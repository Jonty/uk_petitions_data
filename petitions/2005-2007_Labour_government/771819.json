            "background": "Legislation does not allow new grammar schools but does allow schools to become partially selective by aptitude but not by ability.  This means that students can be assessed/tested by how 'sporty' they are or how good they are at 'the arts' or 'languages' but when it comes to academic ability it appears this 'skill' is not important enough to provide a specialist education.  There are only 163 grammar schools left.  Lets give our bright children a chance and secure our future.",
