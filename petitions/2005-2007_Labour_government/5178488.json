Such organisations would include schools, charities and services such as adoption agencies or medical care. \n\nNo tax payer funds should ever be used to support discriminatory organisations.\n\nAny affected organisation should be allowed to continue operation, but would have to raise their own funds if they wished to continue operating.\n\nIf a shortfall in services is created by enforcing anti-discrimination legislation then the Government should then create new publicly controlled organisations. These new bodies should act in full accordance with anti-discrimination legislation and take the place of any discriminatory organisation which has been refused funding.",
