They rely on doing business via telephones.\n\nPreviously, enforcement agencies such as Trading Standards were able to use existing powers under other legislation to obtain addresses from telephone numbers (reverse directory information) through a single national point of contact (SPOC). \n\nFollowing the implementation of RIPA each local authority has to have its own SPOC leading to additional delay and cost at the local level and increased problem for the telecomms service providers who now have to deal with requests from numerous sources instead of one.",
