        "background": "We were promised this would happen when mr Blair was elected, we feel it is up to the British public (The Engine of this Country) to decided who is in charge of this beautiful, diverse and intelligent nation, Tony Blair plans to surrender our power to the EU. We should be able to vote who controls this country not that this was taken into account when Mr Blair was considering Gordon Brown For PM. It has been the way of this country to elect the people/person(s) in charge, I for one don't see why this should change now. Tony Blair is in fact making himself a traitor to this country by giving power out to another person or council outside of the UK without even asking us. Some people are in favor of joining the EU and I for one respect that choice and however there should be a public vote on the matter.",
