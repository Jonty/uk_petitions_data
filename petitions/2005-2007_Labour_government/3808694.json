            "background": "Bill Nicholson served Tottenham Hotspur as a player, coach, manager, scout and president before he passed away in 2004. He managed one of the greatest ever footballing sides - the 1961 double winning Spurs team. Under Nicholson Spurs became the first British club to win a European trophy, and then in 1972 the first British side to win two different trophies. Nicholson is a legend in the game and one of the greatest managers ever. We believe he deserves a posthumous knighthood.",
