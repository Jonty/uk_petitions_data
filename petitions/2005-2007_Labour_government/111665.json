            "background": "We the undersigned petition Mr. Blair to  withdraw British soldiers from all foreign countries they are stationed in except Afghanistan. As Gibraltar, the Ascension Island and the Falkands are important integral parts of Great Britain, we ask that those soldiers who are stationed there remain where they are.\n\nThe Balkans are now a peaceful region, and the Balkan countries have all applied to join the EU. British presence on the island of Cyprus is needless as Turkey has began talks on recognising Greek Cyprus and withdrawing its soldiers from Cyprus. And finally, the Iraqis do not need British soldiers either, because the Iraqi Army itself is now able to secure the area. Please stop telling the Parliament that \"we would betray our allies\" because our allies want to withdraw their soldiers from Iraq, too - even the US.",
