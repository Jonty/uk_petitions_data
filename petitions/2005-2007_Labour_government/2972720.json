            "background": "The EC Directive, \u201cextra measurement information\u201d will become illegal within the EU from the start of 2010.\nThe ban will apply to all products, packaging, advertisements, instructions, brochures, magazines, books, e-commerce, internet sites, internal business processes and catalogues and no-one would be exempt. This will affect UK and Irish exports to the US and US Irish and Asian to the UK. Britain is not strong enough to stop this rot.  Our US allies can still help, (and once again step in to save democracy in Euope.)  This would also be to their advantage.  A threat of a trade war -against French and German products (no need to pick on the British)should do the trick.",
