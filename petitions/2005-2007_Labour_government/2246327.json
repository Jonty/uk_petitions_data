        "background": "A tax on plastic shopping bags in the Republic of Ireland has cut their use by more than 90% and raised millions of euros in revenue.\n\nIn the three months after the tax was introduced, shops handed out just over 23 million plastic bags - about 277 million fewer than normal.\n\nAt a time when the environment is arguably the most hotly debated topic on the political agenda, and recycling consumer waste is one of the biggest problems facing any developed nation, a simple measure such as this one would not only be prudent, surely it is the very least our government should be doing as part of taking steps to promote a more balanced and sustainable way of living in a consumer society.",
