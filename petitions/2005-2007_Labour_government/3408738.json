        "background": "We propose that all planned installations of mobile phone masts in areas soley intended for residential dwellings in the UK are stopped. Those already in situ should cease operation. These developments, without exception, clearly have a detrimental impact on the visual ammenity of all residential areas, as such they should not be granted permission! Additionally until it is PROVEN that these masts DO NOT pose any risk to our health they should be limited to non-residential areas. Thank you.",
