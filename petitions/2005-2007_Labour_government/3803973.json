            "background": "This is to stop the Church of England investing shares in known arms dealers. I propose we stop the CoE from investing their money if they are going to be hypocritical. The bible states \"thou shalt not kill\" surly that also means thou shalt not fund killers. I propose that instead of allowing this the people should have a say in what the CoE invest in by the means of E Mail or an E petition.",
