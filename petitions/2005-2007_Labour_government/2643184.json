            "background": "If you are under the age of 25 and you claim income support or Housing Benefit you will be paid less than a claimant over the age of 25. Does the PM believe that food and other necessities cost less merely because of your age? Does the PM believe that a landlord should accept less rent from a prospective tenant because he is under 25? Conversely, should a person receive more help simply because he is over 25? Is there a Human Rights issue involved here when the Government treats one part of the population differently to the rest? The Government is making it very hard for younger people to support themselves and find accommodation whilst they are under 25. Why, what is their reasoning behind this?",
