Some times they even charge extra for priority.\n\nPriority for those groups is not a matter of price, it's a matter of respect! If the government don't enforce a compulsory priority, those companies will continue on their own rules and new companies will feel compelled to follow the same rules to reduce costs and increase profit.\n\nThis kind of profit should be considered an offence!",
