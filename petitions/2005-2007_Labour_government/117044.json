            "background": "In order to encourage more cycling it should be mandatory for all authorities, large and small to provide suitable facilities for cyclists. County councils an other such bodies (unitary authorities, etc) should be forced to provide comprehensive cycle ways throughout their jurisdiction.\nThose authorities responsible for large urban settlements (Town and City Councils, Borough and Parish councils, etc) should be compelled to provide lockable cycle racks suitably located within their bounds, and all smaller settlements (villages and hamlets) should be compelled to provide some form of bicycle rack within their bounds - i.e. not as comprehensive as the responsibilities of the larger authorities.\n\nThis would result in a similar system as is found in the Netherlands and most parts of Germany - which work very well and consequently result in many more cyclists.",
