We want a full investigation into how many pro Israeli officials, media barons, goverment officials, civil servants, political fundraisers etc.. that could create a conflict of interest at the heart of British goverment that could and would go against British ideals, desires and needs. This invetsigation should include corruption, media coercion by way of blackmailing the goverment in return for positive media reports and fundraising.\nWe want to know how much the pro-Israel lobbys pay and contribute towards the success of any goverment either through funds, extra curriculum work or media coercion.",
