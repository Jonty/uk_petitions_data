            "background": "A politician or senior civil servant should not be entitled to a \"private past\" if there is a potential conflict of interest, especially if that person has been convicted of a criminal offence.\nThere is no general right to privacy when seeking employment or public office. For example, schoolteachers are vetted by the Criminal Records Bureau and are held fully accountable for their past misdemeanours; they do not have the right to keep such details secret. It is not unreasonable to hold politicians to similarly high standards.",
