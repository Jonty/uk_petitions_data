There are many vulnerable people in our society that could benefit by being able to defend themselves.\nWe should not be dissuaded by the concern that criminals may use use pepper spray to commit crime, because that would be preferable to their use of other more lethal weapons.\nThe British people are just as trustworthy as those in France and in other countries.",
