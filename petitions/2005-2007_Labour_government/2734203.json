        "background": "A Private Members Bill has been introduced which seeks to exclude MPs from scrutiny under the Freedom of Information Act.  MPs must be held accountable to the Public for their actions in particular in the manner in which they spend taxpayers money especially in relation to their expenses and their MP's private office. It is unaccaptable that an MP is able to prevent an enquiry into what kind of items and the amounts that MP's claim against expenses and how they spend additional monies provided for their office at the taxpayers expense. The amounts they receive are not theirs to do with as they wish but taxpayers' monies and therefore we have a right to know how they use that money.",
