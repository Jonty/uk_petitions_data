            "background": "Iran has illiegally detained British sailors, in this situation it is clear we need to stop trading with Iran and encourage our allies to do the same, (EU, US etc). It is clear the Irainians are meerly trying to make an example of us in front of the US, we should not allow this. In the event the Iranians fail to release our military staff (inc 1 woman) we should move at least 2 nuclear attack subs and 1 trident missile sub into Iraqi waters and one aircraft carrier to show Britian is not a push over. In the event Iran illegally trials our troops and imprisons them, (possibly killing them) we should launch a cruise missile attack on Iran's nuclear vicilities.\n\nDONT LET BRITAIN BE PUSHED OVER",
