            "background": "It is disgusting that drivers will be hit by another tax.\nWe pay enough with road tax and the very high rate of fuel duty we pay.\nNot including toll roads and congestion charging which should also not be allowed.\nCharging \u00a3300 to park a car outside your own home is ludicrous especially since a car that is parked is not producing any emissions.\nPeople who buy bigger engine cars are paying more in tax already due to the higher fuel consumption.\nLeave the motorist alone!!",
