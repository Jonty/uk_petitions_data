            "background": "Improve the UK's outdated political system.\n\nThe current system of democracy has been a part of this country for a long time now but has become out dated. The country is falling apart and the cracks are being covered by red tape and statisitics.\n\nExperts should lead in their relative areas rather then having political figures jump from one position to another. Scientists should run science with the help of economists. Economists should run the economy. Teachers should run education. \n\nGet rid of the middle men and appoint councils of the various areas expertise based on merit rather then political intrique.\n\nGet rid of the career politician's and have people who know what there doing do the job right.\n\nMaybe then people could have a system they could actually vote for and trust, and for once correct decisions would be made.",
