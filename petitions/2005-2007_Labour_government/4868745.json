            "background": "We invented the glorious game of Football. And it was a credit to our nation that we had three teams in the Semi-finals of the Champions League this year. However I feel that the fact that other footballing nations such as Spain and Italy allow their teams a break over the Christmas period whilst we endure one of the toughest periods of the season is a serious hindrance to our teams in Europe, as well as to our national side as all our players have played a far greater amount of games than any other country. I hereby ask the PM to force the FA to allow this so we may gain back some of the national pride that he has stripped from us. Please do something useful before you retire Tony!",
