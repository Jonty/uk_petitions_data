            "background": "Following a divorce and family law proceedings, I have faced large solictor bills and hefty VAT charges. At a time when households are breaking down, and people are faced with debt and other expenses having to pay VAT is very unfair and just adds to the burden. Studies have shown that divorce leaves people facing large debt problems, from the sale of homes and legal costs, etc. The Government should make work done by solicitors (who charge on average \u00a3180 hour) in these circumstances excempt from the 17.5% VAT.",
