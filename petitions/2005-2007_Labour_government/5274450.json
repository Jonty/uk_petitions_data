            "background": "On 11 June 2007 another Police Officer died whilst serving and protecting the British public. \nEach year, thousands of Police Officers are injured during violent confrontations and, tragically officers are being murdered. \nIn issuing all Police Officers with Taser, a system with a proven track record in terms of safety and success in incapacitation, those officers will be better able to protect both the public and themselves. \nIt is the right of every serving Police Officer, whilst recognising the dangers inherant to the job, to go home to his or her family at the end of their shift. Taser would, at least, help make that more likely.",
