Think about how that would make you feel - there was nothing wrong with your driving - you may even be late and frustratingly obeying ALL road restrictions, limits etc. Having nothing to hide you have nothing to worry about - they say - add an extra 10 minutes to every journey you ever take just in case you get stopped at random? - no way - we say!",
