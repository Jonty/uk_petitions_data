            "background": "I ask the Prime Minister to stop local councils from selling their properties as it encourages some people to have a second home while others tax payers are struggling to get on the property ladder.they buy these properties and sell on when they don't need the property anymore instead of giving it back to the council to house others that might need them creating very serious housing problems in our local councils. I also think that the bidding system in place should be abolished because it's not working and the critials are awful and expensive.",
