Plus they are a great place just to go and drink tea and have a tinker.\n\nWe think that the public should appreciate sheds more and having a national week would be a start - especially when you think that there are so many other National this and that weeks. It's about time the humble garden shed is given an opportunity to shine!\n\nThe Garden shed provides a refuge where gardeners and people who love the outdoors can make use of their local environment and make it a greener place.",
