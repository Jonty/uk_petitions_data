            "background": "We feel that having uniform strips people of their personality and is uncomfortable.  It is expensive to replace the uniform everyday and sometimes unclean as it is hard to wash your uniform in one day if you have a limited time to do it in.  Plus, you can get in trouble for having holes in your uniform or the wrong skirt/trousers and it is not realised that we cannot keep buying uniform.  Having own clothes is easy and they are bought anyway for personal use.",
