If road charges were made I would find it very very hard to manage. After returning to work when my yougest child was 12 years old I have been in pension schemes but this still does not give enough to live on these days. The gas and eletric have been increased by \u00a316 a month from February 2007, rates about to go up in March. I may as well give up and live off benefits which I have never in my life done so,  but it looks like they way things are going that will be the only way to SURVIVE.",
