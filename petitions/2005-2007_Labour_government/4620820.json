            "background": "Where I live, two large organisations have started charging for emplyoyee and student car parking as well as restricting the number of available spaces. It certainly appears that this has significantly increased congestion around these sites. I believe that this can be explained by the fact that many people who would have driven to the site and parked, then driven home again at the end of the day are now being taken and fetched by family members, thus effectively creating four journeys rather than two. After all, school traffic results in congestion for this reason. I propose that a representative town is chosen for an experiment in which all car parks are made free, and on street parking is reviewed to maximise it's availability (is it necessary to have double yellow lines on BOTH sides of most streets?), to see if traffic actually flows more freely. It surely must be more efficient to have someone drive to a location and park than it is to have them picking slowly around the side streets, looking for a space, or being taken to/from work/college by a parent or partner, who then has to make a return journey.",
