            "background": "Dear Prime Minister, I feel very opposed to the closure of Haslar hospital. It is vital for the area in terms of local people, the chaos it would cause to Queen Alexandra Hospital, the impact on travel i.e. only one road out of Gosport.\nApart from the fact it is one of our cleaniest hospitals in the area. i.e. no MRSA at present, this is due to the fact it is run with military precision (a lot to be said)\nWould really be happy to show you around Mr.Blair if you could arrange a visit so you can see for yourself, that not only is it a wonderful hospital in a lovely location it is also vital for the area.\nI myself am a pompey girl but still feel very strongly, as in the past both my husband and son have been treated there including my self, and to the upmost standard.\nI really hope this doesn't fall on deaf ears, I realise you are very busy running our country, and well done for pulling some of our boys back from Iraq, may the good work continue.\n\nregards\nJan Belcher",
