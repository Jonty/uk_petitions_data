            "background": "Watching recently two of the Queens children dreessed as members of the armed forces with a chest full of medals they havent earned, simply confirms how dated they are. They only remind people of Japanese Generals from the last war, or Idi Amin. The award of the Queens Golden Jubilee Medal to her grandsons is a kick in the teeth for all the forces members and public servants who did not qualify at the time. Royal hangers on, Do the time get the medal, stop playing at being soldiers and sailors!!and get a real job",
