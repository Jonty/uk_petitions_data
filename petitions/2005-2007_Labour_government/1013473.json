            "background": "The rules regarding placement of fixed speed cameras are relatively sensible:\nplacement must be in an accident blackspot; they are made very visible; warning signs are put up and their locations are published.\n\nMobile speed cameras, by contrast, are not placed in accident blackspots; can be hidden in vans with no visible markings and are normally positioned in sites designed to generate the maximum amount of income (e.g. on a bridge after a bend on a downhill stretch of motorway - M4 Bridgend).\n\nWe have no objection to speed cameras where their use can be seen to be in the interests of public safety. The current rules once again leave the Road Safety Partnerships open to the accusation of \"money-grabbing\" tactics in their placement of mobile speed cameras.",
