The change to metric has simplified things to such an extent, that basic mathematics is not very taxing on the brain and people have become lazy.  Our education used to be the best in the world and I believe that this was, in part, due to the Imperial measurement system and the old pounds, shillings and pence.  If the world was supposed to be symetrical, we wouldn't have 24 hours in a day or 60 seconds in a minute, nor would we have 365 days in a year and every month would be equal in the number of days.",
