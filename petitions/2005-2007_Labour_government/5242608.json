        "background": "It is my view that before we can begin to set an example and to aid foreign nations, we should resolve our own problems. Gang culture is the biggest problem in the UK today, with many people living in fear of walking out of their own front door. \n\nI feel that the government should bring troops back from overseas to protect our own nation from the threat within. By utilizing the armed forces, such an initiative could be enforced with far greater effectiveness. Only with the firm fist that the armed forces bring, can we truly set about wiping out this gang culture.",
