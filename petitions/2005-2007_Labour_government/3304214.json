            "background": "The primary purpose of bus lanes is to allow buses to avoid traffic congestion, making them more likely to run on time.  The secondary purpose of bus lanes is to make pedal cycling safer by allowing pedal cyclists to avoid heavy traffic;  their slow speed makes them very vulnerable to getting sideswiped by motor vehicles overtaking too closely and getting sucked into the slipstream of passing large vehicles.\n\nAllowing motorcycles, taxis, and scooters into bus lanes will put congestion into bus lanes, negating their primary purpose.  Allowing large numbers of fast-moving, and\u2014in the case of powered-two-wheelers\u2014small and therefore harder to see, vehicles into bus lanes will negate their secondary purpose.\n\nIn the interests of better public transport and safer self-powered transport, powered-two-wheelers and taxis must be kept out of bus lanes.",
