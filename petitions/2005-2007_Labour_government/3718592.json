            "background": "The closure of our Post Offices is a direct consequence of our membership to the EU. Article 88 of the Treaty of Nice and EU directive 2002/39/EC have threatened the subsidy paid to support rural Post Offices - a vital necessity to local communities. \nWe wish the Prime Minister to admit to the origin of these closures, and to repeal the 1972 European Communities Act, so we can get out of the EU, and regain control of our own affairs, returning accountability to our elected politicians in Parliament.",
