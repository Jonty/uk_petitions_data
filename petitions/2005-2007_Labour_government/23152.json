        "action": "Reduce the influence of party politics by abolishing the position of Whips, and allow MPs to vote according to the wishes of their constituency.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently MPs are required by party Whips, and enforced by sanctions, to follow party lines rather than voting as the members of their constituency request them to. This makes a mockery of the democratic process particularly at the most crucial pieces of legislation when a three line Whip ensures obedience from party MPs despite huge protests from the population. \n\nIf this situation were changed than the majority of Bills would not be affected, and the government could continue to function normally, but significant actions could not be forced from Party office, instead the government would have to listen to the wishes of the populace, through the MPs. This is after all what we elected them to do.\n\nAs a side effect the personal policies of an MP would again become important which would lead to a greater turnout in elections as people would believe that their vote genuinely counted for something worthwhile.",
