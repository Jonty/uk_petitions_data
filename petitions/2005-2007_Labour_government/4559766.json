            "background": "250 000 Serbs Albanians have left Kosovo since June 1999. Ethnic violence is widespread. Violence continues in East Timor, Iraq, and Afghanistan, with their multinational peacekeepers. Violence amongst the Tamil Tigers and the Basque separatists has increased following the decision by the British Government to unilaterally grant Kosovo independence. The remaining Serbs, Roma and others would be forced out of an independent Kosovo. \u2018Nations\u2019 such as Taiwan and Somaliland are not internationally recognised. The UN should preserve the internationally recognised borders of its member States and aid the process of reconciliation between Serbia and all its citizens. Granting independence as a reward for violence will set a dangerous precedent, encouraging terrorism and armed revolt throughout all ethnically mixed nations. The unity of Serbia must be recognised and internationally guaranteed. The forced removal of 15% of a recognised State\u2019s territory is illegal in international law.",
