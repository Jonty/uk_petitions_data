As a result, medical staff are using the naked eye to judge the amount suitable for children. Such a simple campaign will make a lot of difference, to what is becoming a truly mammoth problem. We at the India Development Trust, a UK based charity, are campaigning for a more effective use of medicine available to combat HIV/AIDS.",
