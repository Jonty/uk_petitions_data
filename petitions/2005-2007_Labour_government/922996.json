            "background": "It has become apparent in recent years that we face a growing problem with Islamic extremism, among other forms of terrorism. There needs to be changes in the way cases are dealt with and the punishments that can be used. \n\n\u201cAttempting to cause explosions\u201d does not cover the crime well enough. People who willingly try to commit atrocities like 7/7 are traitors and need to be dealt with accordingly, and that there should be a clear message that terrorism is wrong to try and discourage young people from participating in it as well as using other social methods to stop disaffection and segregation.\n\nThere is little point in putting these people in prison as they will not get appropriate sentences, will not change their warped views and when released will just continue with the same behaviour as before.",
