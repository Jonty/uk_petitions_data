            "background": "Jeff Stelling is the presenter of many hugely popular programmes on Sky Sports, with his most notable being Gillette Soccer Saturday. The most famous Hartlepool United fan in the world, Jeff Stelling has entered the hearts of football fans all across the country with his passionate belief in his club and his passion for football in general. With puns galore, his coverage of all the Saturday fixtures is not only informative but highly entertaining, with his on screen banter no better than when he is claiming the virtues of Emile Heskey with the legendary 'Pie-man' Matt Le Tissier. This man deserves every honour this country can bestowe upon him.",
