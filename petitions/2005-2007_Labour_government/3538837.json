            "background": "It is my view that as a nation we are being taxed to the hilt. I am fed up with most of my hard working wage being paid to the government in taxes. In order for the middle class to have a good standard of life i believe the government should seriously contemplate what impact there taxation policies are having on every day people. As a question, Just what do we not pay tax on as a nation!! I`d estimate that 50% of my wages goes to the government in various forms of tax. It has to stop! Mr Brown stop wasting our hard earned money on non essentials and give us a tax cut!!",
