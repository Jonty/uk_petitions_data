It is not fair to the hard-working, tax paying folk of this country to have to fund layabouts.  There can be no excuse (not even a bad back, sore leg, stress, alcoholism etc.etc.) for people not to work in this country. This has been demonstrated by the amount of immigrants that have come to the UK to work.\nIf you stop paying them a king\u2019s ransom to sit at home, then the people that have made the lifestyle choice to live off the system will have no option but to work for a living. \n\nPaying middle class wages to these shirkers will not give them the incentive to work...surely that is obvious?",
