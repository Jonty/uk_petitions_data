            "background": "The 1 per cent bracket of Stamp Duty currently affects home purchases valued between \u00a3125,000 and \u00a3250,000.  The average house price now exceeds \u00a3200,000.  More than half of home purchases are covered even though the tax was only intended to affect the wealthy.  As a first step, the 1 per cent bracket should be abolished, this would cost around \u00a31.75 billion in 2007-08 but would be an important first step to assisting homebuyers.",
