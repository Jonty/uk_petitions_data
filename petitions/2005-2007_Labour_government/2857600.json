            "background": "The principles of Derbyshire Compact were agreed as: \n\nVolunteering is an essential component of a democratic society\n\nAn independent & diverse VCS is essential to the wellbeing of society \n\nIn the development & delivery of public policy & services, the statutory sector & VCS have distinct but complementary roles\n\nThere is a common need for integrity, objectivity, liability, honesty & respect Voluntary & community organisations should be free to campaign within the law in order to advance their aims \n\nThe need for the statutory sector to allocate adequate & appropriate resources to voluntary & community organisations is recognised including funding & advice & other support. They are important elements of the relationship between the sectors \n\nUnfortunately for my local CVS this has not been upheld. Use your freedom of speech & ask the PM to direct local councils into ensuring they adhere to COMPACT. Act now save Voluntary Action Bolsover now before your council does this to you",
