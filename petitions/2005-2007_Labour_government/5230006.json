I feel it is an embarrassment and portrays our country in the worst possible way. \n\nThe original London 2012 Logo was better by far. We need a new logo now, or at least a return to the old one!\n\nI am happy that the olympics are coming to London and feel proud that we can showcase ourselves to the world but am deeply embarassed at \u00a3400,00 wasted on a dismal Olympic logo",
