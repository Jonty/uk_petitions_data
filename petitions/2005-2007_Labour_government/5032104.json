            "background": "State school teachers and LEA staff (such as educational psychologists) are placed under a gag order by the government which prevents them from recommending that parents withdraw their children from the state school system. \n\nIf a teacher or an LEA employee advises a parent to withdraw their child from a state school because they are seriously unhappy or the school cannot meet their needs, then they will get sacked.\n\nI therefore propose that this gag order is abolished and teachers and LEA staff are free to recommend home schooling if they feel that it is in the child's best interest.",
