        "action": "exempt acute Mental Health wards from the smoking ban",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This July all enclosed public places and workplaces in England and Wales will become smoke-free. Under the proposed regulations certain institutions - such as prisons, hospices and secure mental health units - which provide long term residential accommodation, will be exempt.  The details are still under discussion, but the exemption will not apply to the 420 acute psychiatric units where people with mental health problems stay for less than six months. Smoking is often the only solace mental health patients have, and patients under section will not be allowed off the ward for a cigarette. This may contravene the Human Rights Act provision for \"a private life\" and will certainly serve to make acute mental health wards an alien and inhospitable place for distressed smokers, especially those on section.",
