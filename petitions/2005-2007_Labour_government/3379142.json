Why is there a cure?that we are not being told about!\n If you have ms you have ms.\nAre you aware of the extreme stress and anxiety reapplying causes?\nI would ask the prime-minister to review the award criteria for longterm conditions,and also the\nassessment criteria.\nI am sure that alot of money would be saved from not reassessing and having doctors assessments 2 yearly.",
