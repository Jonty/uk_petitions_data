            "background": "To bring about fundamental changes in the planning laws to prohibit developers from submitting multiple and subsequent (= a series of, as such) applications for the same site, when the local planning authority has acted in accordance with local democratic practices and wishes and rejected such multiple and subsequent applications, AND such rejection has likewise been confirmed by the Planning Inspectorate. A limit should therefore be placed on how many times, say 2 or 3, a developer may submit such aplications for the same site when it is plain that the opposition to such applications by the local planning authority and local residents is immovable.",
