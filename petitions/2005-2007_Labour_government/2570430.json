            "background": "I was 3 months pregnant when my employee subjected me to sex discrimination due to my pregnancy. As a result of this I suffered from stress and was signed off work. As I wanted to concentrate on having a successful pregnancy I waited until after the birth of my son to persue my claim- only to be told that I was out of time (3 months). This is disgraceful- my employee gets away now with treating women in this manner and no-one can help. I propose that the time limit should be increased to 12 months from the first incident of discrimiantion.",
