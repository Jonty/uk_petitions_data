            "background": "The recent response from the Prime Minister to the ID cards petition repeated many assertions on the usefulness of ID cards. However, it remained light on facts and references to back up those assertions. Furthermore, a number of figures used appear to be, at the very least, misleading. E.g. it has been reported that:\n\nThe 900,000 crime scenes referred to by the Prime Minister actually relates to 900,000 crime scene marks found at scenes of unsolved crimes, i.e. significantly less than 900,000 crimes;\nThe figure of \u00a31.8bn attributed to ID fraud gives no suggestion as to what percentage of this may be mitigated by the use of ID cards or how it would be reduced.\n\nFinally, the Prime Minister appears to dismiss a study one of the nation's most prestigious and internationally renowned universities, LSE, as deliberately exaggerating the cost of ID cards without explaining the methodology behind his own figures.",
