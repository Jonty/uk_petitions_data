We live in and travel through areas that are poorly maintained, vandalized, poorly lit and dangerous. We grow up in an environment of lawlessness and intimidation.\n\nThe government repeatedly creates excuses for failing to protect our basic right to safety.\n\nAll gun, firearms, knife crime and drug offences laws should be enforced rigorously without exceptions.\n\nWe request that you sign our petition to help us make the government aware of our situation and to require they fulfil their basic obligation to enforce the law.",
