            "background": "Following on from \"Home Office Research Study 241\" from the \"Home Office Research, Development and Statistics Directorate\nNovember 2002\", the Coroner's Court system needs to be reviewed so that cases which are straightforward (and in which the family concur with that decision) do not need to go through the formal processes under legislation. This would spare certain families from the pain of the process, as well as freeing up capacity in the system to deal with less-straightforward cases.",
