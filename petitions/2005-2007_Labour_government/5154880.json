            "background": "Within the planning white paper, the DCLG proposes that an indepent planning commission will review projects of national significance, taking approval out of the hands of local government. NCE magazine along with the Insitution of Civil Engineers, the Association for Consulting and Engineering, and the Civil Engineering Contractors Association feel strongly that civil engineers must be part of this panel. \nICE president Quentin Leiper said: \u201cIt is vital that high quality professional advice on the engineering issues is on the inside of the planning decision-making process.\n\u201cThis means that at least some members of the [commission] should themselves be chartered engineers. Civil engineers will play a key role in the design and construction of this infrastructure and are ready to play their part in developing the new planning framework.\n\u201cThe experience of civil engineers in responding fully to environmental and social project constraints will be an invaluable input.\u201d",
