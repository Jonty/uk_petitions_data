If these photos could be shared via the internet there would be a good chance that many wanted individuals could be identified & located. This could also reduce burdens on police resources, increase the rate of 'solved' crime and give a degree of closure to many persons who may have suffered as a victim of crime.\n\nWe have the technology with over a million CCTV cameras operating in the UK now we should be using it more effectively - work smarter, not harder.",
