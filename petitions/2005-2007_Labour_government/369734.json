Let the public decide what we want for our country.  We should be the ones who decide on who should be allowed to stay here and under what rules. Lets deport any illegal immigrant or any immigrant that breaks the law. Handouts are far too easy given from the Taxes we work for. We are becoming a minority in our own country.  Anyone allowed to stay here should abide by our rules or be invited to leave.",
