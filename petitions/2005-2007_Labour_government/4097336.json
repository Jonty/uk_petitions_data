            "background": "Laws should apply universally to all for them to be considered fair.  There should be no specific exemptions based on religious belief because it is merely that: \"belief\", rather than something that can be proven.  Once you go down the route of allowing a group of people to say \"we don't want this law to apply to us because of what we believe\" then anybody can say that any law conflicts with their beliefs and demand an exemption.  Therefore, religious exemptions create an unfair disparity in society and make a mockery of the process of law.\nAll future laws should be free from religious exemptions, and existing laws should be ammended when reasonably possible.",
