This petition is to ensure that the government does not close HMNB Devonport in favour of other bases. Defence spending constitutes a significant portion of the South Western economy and HMNB Devonport is a significant source of employment and funding for Plymouth and the surrounding area. It is imperative therefore that a possible closure is opposed.",
