            "background": "Laminated Floors are a Health and Safety issue.Poorly insulated they are dangerous to human health and cause shock,excacerbating any existing health conditions.Although written in law in council tenancy agreements,Councils are ignoring existing laminated floors,\ndeeming them a minor,unnecessary,invalid task.Continuous shock is not minor and is extremely dangerous.I have had headaches,hypertension,migraine,numbness of limbs.3 years of noise,perpetrated,by intransigent neighbours,resulting in depression and serious pain.It is the councils collective environmental responsibility.With no sleep I am as vulnerable as a small child or a babe in a cot.I am a Sound Technician of 25 years and I know the dangers of noise delivered badly.The frequencies of plastic are unnatural.Welded to concrete they create reverberation.In short.Waves of confusion.This causes anxiety and fear of the unknown.Plastic is Landfill.\nWe need an organic substitute.It's kinder to the ears and the environment.\nThanking you in advance.\nPaul Coxon",
