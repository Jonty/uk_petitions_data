Why should the British public have to obey these laws when the Law-makers don't?\n\nFor example: What makes Westminster different to a Private Factory? They are both public places, therefore if smoking is banned in the factory it should be banned in Westminster too!\n\nIf the politicians, Lords and other hangers-on in Westminster don't obey the laws they create, they make the government, and parliament a Dictatorship NOT a democracy.",
