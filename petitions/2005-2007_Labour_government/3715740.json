The big bang theory and \u2018inflation\u2019 require accelerations VASTLY faster than light. Quantum entanglement and tunnelling both demonstrate faster than light behaviour. When we look at the causality of general space the speed of light is simply to slow, making Relativity incompatible with a real universe. (this makes it a joke as stupid as the flat earth theory)\n When we  look for tachyonic behaviour we find it everywhere - Hawking radiation, quantum limits, \u2018dark matter\u2018, gravity.",
