        "background": "The government is currently chasing the idea to raise the school leaving age to 18 years. To assist in this and provide much needed additions to the Armed Forces, should a young person refuse to stay in school until at least 18 years of age, they should be conscripted to serve in the Armed Forces for a period of at least 3 years. This will reduce the numbers of young persons collecting benefit, increase the education of a vast number of young persons and also increase the numbers of a rapidly dwindling Armed Forces.",
