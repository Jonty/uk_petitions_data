            "background": "Under current conditions Slavs in the UK are forced either to accept a role of inferior servants who have been exploited, abused, insulted and degraded, or they have been put outside the law and criminalised.\n\nAlthough the Slavic minority has to pay taxes in the UK like the British majority, they are treated like second class inhabitants and Anti-Slavism has been spreading throughout all levels of the British society.\n\nHowever, Slavs are not second class beings. They are intelligent and educated people and their fundamental right is to have an equal position in the society.\n\nThe UK government is therefore demanded\n\n- to take effective steps to stop spreading anti-Slavism and to put an equal position of the Slavic minority within the UK in the law,\n\n- to admit voting right for the Slavic minority,\n\n- to allow the Slavic minority to be represented in the government, and\n\n- to admit equal social conditions to the Slavic minority.",
