All we see every day in our newspapers or on TV is our troops being killed or grossly injured. (We never see any positive reports from ther region).  This is a terrible situation that appears to be getting worse and may never be resolved.   The withdrawal of some of our troops later in the year is too far away and therefore needs to be brought forward.",
