            "background": "Stamp duty is an unfair tax on people who want to buy a home to live in. \n\nWe have already paid tax on our income through the PAYE system and then when we choose to spend our hard earned cash on a home we are taxed again. \n\nIronically, as a result of this tax we end up borrowing more money on the mortgage which is then being paid back with interest so a double whammy ! \n\nIf you must have these taxes then charge only those who purchase multiple properties or at least invest the money back into housing for people who cannot get on the housing ladder through a ringfenced account.",
