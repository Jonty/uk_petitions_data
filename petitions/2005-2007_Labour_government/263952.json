            "background": "Its a security risk to allow anyone to enter the country without showing their face.If all of the british population went round wearing balaclavas,it would be seen as a threat.Why should it be any different for muslim women to cover their face at all times but we all have to show our faces and go through stringent checks at passport security. On cctv, if everyone covered their faces,there would be a significant risk of crime.  Criminals with asbos & escaped prisoners would not be identified, pedophiles can lurk around school grounds and so on.I have been made aware that there are a number of men using the current law to wear religious clothing to escape identification and a number of these will probably be in this country illegally and leaving it after commiting a crime.If all people who decide to cover their face are identified by fingerprint it would be better.Changing certain laws will prevent much of the injustices our people face.",
