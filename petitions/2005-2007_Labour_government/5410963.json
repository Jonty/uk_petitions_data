            "background": "The recent horrendous weather the UK has experienced has resulted in the flooding of many homes in towns and cities across the country.  It has also, unfortunately, resulted in the loss of life.  The majority of this damage could have been avoided had local waterways been kept clean and clear of rubbish and flotsam, which is the responsibility of local councils.  The councils should therefore be made accountable for having waterways under their control that are blocked and allow water to overflow.",
