        "action": "introduce a scheme whereby disabled people are encouraged into senior positions and which allows them to put a portion of their salary tax-free towards paying for a professional support worker or carer",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "People with autism often feel unable to apply for senior posts because they need additional personal support in addition to their professional skills; people with dyslexia often do not apply for senior positions because they need professional support in addition to their personal skills; people with asthma, epilepsy and mental illnesses are often able to make professional decisions, but need the supervision of someone when their disability affects them. Most disabled people have a valued contribution to make to business, government and the voluntary sector, but need additional support to do so. There are schemes that have been introduced where parents can put some of their salary tax-free towards childcare and a similar scheme should be introduced so disabled people can put some of their salary tax-free towards a professional support worker or carer.",
