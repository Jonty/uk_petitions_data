        "background": "Scrapping the idea of study leave is utterly ludicrus, do you actually think pupils will do more work in school? this isn't the 19th century anymore. The pupils aren't going to want to be there and will become more antisocial towards staff as they become increacingly frustrated or 'bored'. I think giving pupils the choice is far more apropraite placing teachers on a 'rotation scheme' where groups of staff go in each week on a roation basis so there is a different group of staff each week (ei one staff for each subject) making revision far more relaxed and less like a chore.",
