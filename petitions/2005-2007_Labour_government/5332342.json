            "background": "Currently employers are required to determine their employees date of birth to add them to payroll.  This undermines any efforts by the Government to prevent ageist employment practices.  Other countries have already taken the lead and disallowed employers from asking questions of a personal nature.  We ask that the government take ageism as seriously as racism and religious intolerance.",
