            "background": "Camelford is a small town in Cornwall which sits astride the A39.In the center of the town the road narrows to single lane traffic controlled by traffic lights.  During peak periods queues can tail back for as much as 6 miles. Our town will not be considered for this much needed distributor road, for at least another 10 years. During this time there are many old buildings (homes and businesses) which will be severally damaged by traffic vibration.\nPlanning permission has already been given for a distributor road by Cornwall County Council and enviromental work has been carried out. The road at the moment will cost \u00a314 million CCC has \u00a36.8 million.  The unelected Government Office of the South West has recommended central government to refuse the extra money.  Please sign this petition to help our town to breathe again.",
