        "background": "I think that allowing students to take PE further (at GCSE and A'-level) is absolutely atrocious. It doesn't get you anywhere and is a complete waste of time - they could be studying a language or something else more worthwhile other than PE. Religious Studies should not be forced in schools, especially at GCSE level. Students have enough work to do without having to worry about that too. Again, it doesn't get you anywhere.",
