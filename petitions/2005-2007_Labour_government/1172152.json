Bourbon biscuits were in cahoots with Hitler and they passed on valuable information about shelf stock in the UK during the war. Borbon biscuits also pursuaded Ghengis Khan to rampage. Before Bourbons he  was a gentle giant. These biscuits need to be taken away before they do any more harm. Please sign my petition. Please also see my petition on Marmite.",
