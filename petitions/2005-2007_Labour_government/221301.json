It changes the way the roads are policed. It has done immeasurable damage to the police / public relationship. Far from being a precision tool, it's the equivalent of a rather heavy and badly aimed hammer. \n\nSpeed cameras are obviously bad psychology.\n\nAccording to Department for Transport figures\nonly 5% of crashes involve a speeding vehicle. This survey is evidence of gross\ndistortions of public opinion caused directly by speed camera and speed kills\npropaganda.",
