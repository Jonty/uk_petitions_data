            "background": "Universally, the brightest women are given the longest education due to competitive entry to schools and universities. Also, educated women have more status and, on average, choose to have fewer children than those in societies where women are restricted to just child-rearing. Unfortunately, by simple Darwinian logic, if less intelligent women produce more children, then the population will become increasingly less intelligent with each generation. To counter this effect, our wealthy society should offer less intelligent women extra pensions, tax breaks and any kind of positive discrimination desired to match the attractions of an education and fulfilling career normally only open to highly intelligent professional women. No coercion would be allowed, only positive distractions, but as a first step, birth control pills should certainly be made free and easily available.",
