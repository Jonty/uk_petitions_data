            "background": "the current licence runs from 1st april until 31st march the following year,so if you purchase a licence in june you would still pay the full price,but only have a ten month licence,surely the licence running for a year from the day of purchase is a fairer option.as for scrapping the licence,it is a victorian idea brought in to stop the working class man from indulging in what the victorians saw as an upper class pursuit.i.e. tax the poorer man out of it,and if he does get caught fishing without a licence,fine him.is this an early form of stealth tax?most anglers today purchase quiet willingly there yearly licence(on the 31st march)but most aslo agree that to help attract more people into the pastime there has to be a fairer licencing system",
