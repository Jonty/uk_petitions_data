Closure occured despite electrification in 1954. and journey times between the the two cities are now longer and existing routes are at capacity. \n\nReopening the Woodhead summit line and introducing through trains Manchester - Woodhead - Penistone - Barnsley - Sheffield - St. Pancras will increase capacity between London and Manchester, and could take a lot of lorries off the road!",
