My daughter's school celebrate all religious days, but when it came to the christmas play , the school was so worried about including other religions, it failed to mention jesus and what christmas was about. There were no carols either.The other religions never learn about christianity, but we have to learn about them. There were many disapointed parents that day.  is this fare?",
