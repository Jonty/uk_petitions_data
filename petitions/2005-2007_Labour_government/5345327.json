        "background": "I am extremely concerned about the trend that seems to have developed, whereby employers can impose on their staff internal policies (notably so-called Equality and Diversity Policies) which brazenly pander to political correctness by elevating the right of emloyees not to be offended over and above the rights of other employees to express themselves freely.  Freedom of expression must never be subordinated to another's right not to be offended.  Otherwise, we no longer live in a free society.  The only legitimate restrictions on freedom of expression should arise where a person may, by so expressing himself, be guilty of slander, libel or incitement to violence.",
