            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Having noticed the amount of traffic on the nations roads and the problems that this brings - a simple solution would be to remove our nations freight to work outside of certain times. For example there could be a policy to make freight transport opperate between the hours of 7pm until 7am.\n\nThis would remove heavy transport and delivery vehicles from our highways\n\nI believe this would have the following effects:-\n\nReduction in fatal accidents due to collisions with heavy traffic.\n\nReduction in pollution at peak periods\n\nReduction in congestion by spreading traffic through out the 24 hour day.\n\nIncrease in employment (night shift for deliveries / increase of police etc).\n\nIncrease in national productivity to business (no lost hours sat in traffic)\n\nIncrease revenues from freight traffic (tax to police outside hours deliveries).",
