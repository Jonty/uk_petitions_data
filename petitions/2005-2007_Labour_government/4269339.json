            "background": "We seek that any issuer of monetary promissary notes would become part of a larger group of British Banks. For example, the British Bank of England, The British Bank of Clydesdale, The British Bank of Scotland, etc.\n\nBritish banks such as those in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and the Isle of Mann are able to print their own promissary notes, each having a pattern distinct from the others. Whilst we recognise the need and tradition for money to be printed all over Britain we would ask that all such promissary notes be of a set pattern so a note printed in one part of the UK is not liable to be wrongly rejected elsewhere. By creating a larger organisation to regulate note issuing banks we believe that a common likness and acceptance of notes is achievable.",
