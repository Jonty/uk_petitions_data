The responsibility of such an act should not be placed solely on the serving government of the day but on its nation as a whole. A national referendum should be made compulsory in the event that such a serving government considers that war is necesary  when all peaceful avenues of process have been exhausted. There must be a clear majority of support for or against a war and this result must be legally binding and the government must legally uphold such a decision. The only exception being when another nation carries out a nuclear strike or invasion against the United Kingdom.",
