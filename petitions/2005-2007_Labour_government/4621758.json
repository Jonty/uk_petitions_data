            "background": "The time was put back and forth to help farmers during the war years. As this is no longer needed, perhaps the government would leave the time as it is and not put the time back an hour come October. This would help reduce crime. As it stays daylight longer, crime would not be commited as easily as it is during the nights when the time is back an hour. I urge the government to seriously consider this, even as a trial for 1 year.",
