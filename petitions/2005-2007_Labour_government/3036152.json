            "background": "Manchester wants to be a second city. It can be that as Birmingham is second to none! London wants everything! It can keep road charging and congestion charges to itself! Birmingham should pursue its own forward thinking Transport Policy that does not penalise the poorer citizens for needing a car to go to work, does not split society into two groups \u2013 \u2018those that can pay can drive\u2019 and \u2018those that need to drive can\u2019t pay\u2019. The current transport system is inadequate, dirty, allows people to smoke dope on buses and is unsafe in certain areas and at certain times of the day. Public transport needs conductors to protect the citizens as they go about their daily life.  A forward thinking policy that would be cheap to employ is \u2018Free Public Transport\u2019 for people going to work at \u2018Peak Times\u2019. It would cost a lot less to subsidise than any consultancy scheme to investigate why people use their car and how to force them off the road.",
