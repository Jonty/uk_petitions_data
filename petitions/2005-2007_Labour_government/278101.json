        "background": "As most suburban london black cab taxi drivers know, it is now virtually impossible to make a living from being a taxi driver without having to work more than 60 hours a week given the expenses we incur, and the time we put into training to get our licenses. \n\nThis is due to many reasons ranging from too many drivers,\nand not enough paying passengers, insurance costs, license fees, plus the ridiculous emissions 3 legislation imposed by the Mayor of London, the PCO, the cab trade vehicle prices, and EU legislation, and a lack of choice of other 7 or 8 seater vehicles that mini cab drivers can have, but black cabs can`t through false legislation.\n\nAppointments to senior management positions at the PCO should be given to taxi drivers and not ex-police officers who got given these jobs by virtue of its former association with the Met Police and its masonic links.",
