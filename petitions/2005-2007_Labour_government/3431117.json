            "background": "Prohibition of drugs leads to organised crime, and is a means for terrorists to fund mass murder.  Our pharmaceutical, tobacco and brewing companies could manage the licensed sale of recreational drugs efficiently and profitably. Mandatory drug testing in schools would protect the youth. Peasant growers in Columbia and Afghanistan would earn money to feed and educate their children, and improve their standard of living.  Duty on drugs would provide funds for schools, hospitals etc. Tobacco and alcohol cause cancer, heart disease and liver disease, destroy families, yet they are not prohibited. It is time to apply a consistent approach to all recreational drugs, prohibition is a nightmare. Why not try regulation and taxation.  It is no coincidence that the war on terror is being fought in the poppy fields of Afghanistan. Either our government controls drugs, or the gangsters and terrorists do.",
