            "background": "For anyone who lives in the affected villages of Mottram, Hollingwoth or Tintwistle life is becoming unbearable due to the ever increasing levels of traffic through the villages. The roads were not designed to cope with the number of vehicles currently passing through the area.\n\nThe Highways agency must recognise that the only solution to the problem is to bypass the affected villages and the sooner that this is completed, the sooner people's lives will improve. A bypass will lead to a streamlined route across the Pennines and move the traffic problems away from any significantly populated areas.\n\nThis is an opportunity for the silent majority to voice their oppinion to counter to vocal minority who largely live outside the affected areas.",
