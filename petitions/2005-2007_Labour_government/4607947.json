This is sexism. This should not be tolerated as\n1) Its discrimination\n2) The Radical Feminists give anyone else who belives on womens rights a bad name\n3) Some men are slowly starting to feel that women seem to have taken over due to this (another way how the radicals give normal people a bad name)\n\nI have no problem with womens rights at all but these radical feminists must be stopped as its discrimination and men have rights too. The Government should incude this in any discrimination acts that currently exist",
