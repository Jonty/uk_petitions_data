We feel that it is grossly unfair that the people of Wales are excempt from paying for prescriptions where as those in England have to pay.  This is particularly unfair to those living in England when you consider that without the taxation from all UK residents then the Welsh and scottish assemblies could not survive on revenue generated from their own regions alone.",
