            "background": "The Sunday Sport newspaper has launched a national search for over 100 dwarves in order to hold the largest dwarf tossing event ever held. \n\nDwarfs, midgets and little people are being recruited to appear at the secret location at the end of the month to resurrect the sport of Dwarf Tossing.  The event is being run by the Sunday Sport following a request from Phil the Dynamo dwarf (the newspaper\u2019s resident dwarf photographer) after he heard that the experience was exhilarating.  \n\nThis sport has been banned in various states across America, France and Canada and i feel that it should be banned in the UK as well!  \n\nThis kind of \"sport\" is degrading, vile and insulting and should be banned!",
