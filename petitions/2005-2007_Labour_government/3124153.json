            "background": "Public discontent with inheritance tax is driven by the increasing number of estates having to pay it. Indexing approximately in line with general inflation has clearly failed to stem this rising number. As many small estates consist essentially of one domestic property, it would make sense to index the threshold retrospectively in line with property prices in SE England, or whichever region other than London shows the highest rise. I do not recommend using London house prices, as these are strongly influenced by other issues such as Governments' and companies' failure to relocate sufficient jobs to Northen England, Scotland, Wales and Cornwall. I suggest that the lost revenue be replaced by a 50% income tax rate, introduced at the highest possible theshold level.",
