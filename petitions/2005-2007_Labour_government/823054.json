            "background": "I do not see why shops Like Topman,Topshop, Next and any other retailers or shops which do not sell age restricted products. I belive the goverment and the public should encourage these retailers to treat 14 15 and 16 year olds equally when applying for part time work obviously  the employer should only have to hire the applicant if they have proven they are comitted to the job. Not only this but if the goverment succeds in this there will be a bigger workfore in years to come thus imporving the national workforce. I do not think employers should overlook the younger generation as we are the future. The goverment should be encouraging us to prepare for the future to help the economy.  Around the world the teen image of Britian is a yob culture, we need to change this to an image britian can be proud of.  AGE IS JUST A NUMBER  COME ON GIVE US A CHANCE FOR A BETTER TODAY AND A EXCELLENT FUTURE.",
