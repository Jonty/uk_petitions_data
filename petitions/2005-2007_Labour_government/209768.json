            "background": "Research has identified expenditure of at least \u00a3100m in the past year, but the true figure is likely to be much more. \n\nLocal councils spend at least \u00a325m; the police \u00a321m; the courts system spends more than \u00a310m without accounting for the cost of legal aid; and the NHS - a conservative estimate is \u00a355m. \n\nEven though government departments refer to an obligation to translate, any legal imperative is far from clear.\nA Home Office funded community centre has translated documents and services into 76 languages.In the East End of London, Barts Hospital alone spends \u00a31m a year. Guy's Hospital in South London spends almost \u00a3600,000 a year - an increase of 28% in the past 12 months. Islington Primary Care Trust, for instance, provides stop smoking advice in Somali and Turkish - often one-to-one sessions through an interpreter. \n\nThis is a waste of tax payers money and merely fosters divison and not integration. If you live in the country you should speak, read & write in English",
