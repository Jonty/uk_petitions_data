            "background": "In many cases, the police are unable to act on criminals, eg underage youths drinking on the streets and taking drugs, as they are powerless and have their hands tied by beauracracy and red tape. This petition is aimed at enabling the police to gain more powers and more options at dealing with anti-social behaivour, crimes and criminals. In this country, many people see the law as a joke, and unless the police are giving more power and control over what they do then the situation is not going to get any better.",
