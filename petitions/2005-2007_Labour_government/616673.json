            "background": "to counter balance the other petition because I believe how ever well meaning, it is flawed in that a lot of people dont have the neccessary skills to ride a moped, scooter or motorcycle. it would be an unneccassary expense on already limited resources and so many more inexperienced riders on the road would cause more accidents. further it would be difficult to force people to actually ride them other than for the actual cbt. then a machine could simply be locked away taxed and insured for a year.",
