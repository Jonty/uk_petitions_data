            "background": "The government are clearly against individuals driving cars that, in the opinion of some people, are not kind to the environment, such as 4-wheel drives and saloons.\n\nWhilst the government continues to support this view, it is not acceptable that our leaders and senior civil servants continue to be chauffeur driven in large executive 'gas-guzzlers'.\n\nI therefore propose that these cars are replaced by the 'eco-friendly' hybrid cars, thus leading by example and minimising the obscene levels of hypocracy that is prevalent in this present government.",
