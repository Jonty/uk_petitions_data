        "action": "reduce the danger to wildlife and domestic pets by forbidding the mass release of gas filled balloons for publicity or any other purpose",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "These balloons travel short and long distances, but inevitably return to the ground or land in water.  They are then likely to be swallowed by wildlife, pets or fish, and possibly young children. Because of the nature of the balloon material it frequently chokes the animal.  In some cases it can block lungs or intestines leading to a lingering and painful death.\nThey also cause brightly coloured litter in many situations.",
