            "background": "At present ambulance crews have no right to refuse transportation to anyone. This extends to drunks who live across the road from the hospital, and do not want to pay for a taxi, to people with a cold who attended hospital 6 hours previously but don\u2019t feel any better.\n\nI suggest that we petition the government to allow Ambulance staff to refuse transport where:-\n1.\tThere is no perceived medical need for the patient to attend an Accident and Emergency department. This would include people with, for example, a cold or those with similar minor illnesses or injuries that could receive the appropriate treatment at home from their GP.\n2.\tThere is appropriate alternative transport available. This may be in the all too common situation where a patient walks out to the Ambulance and is followed to hospital by their mum, partner, son etc. with no treatment required en-route.",
