            "background": "Biofuels are not a valid replacement for petrol.\n\nPlanting the crops not only causes mass deforestation, it also displaces people. More importantly, its carbon footprint is actually higher than that of current fuels.\n\nThe government's plans intend to ensure  that by 2050 a third of the fuel used in Britain will be biofuel. The government uses this as indication that it is becoming more eco-friendly. The reality is that it is actually more destructive.\n\nIf Britain wants to combat global warming and climate change it cannot push the carbon cost on to the countries producing the fuels, the government's current retort to the fact biofuel is as a whole more damaging than oil. Global warming is, after all, global.\n\nThis petition requests that the Prime Minister acknowledge that biofuels are neither sustainable nor ecologically sound and stop promoting them in Parliament, and to the public, as being such.",
