            "background": "The housing market is out of control. Councils should be stopped from allowing council houses to be sold off UNLESS that council is building / generating replacement council properties for rent. Poor people especially young people cannot even afford to rent a property let alone buy one due to out of control housing market. Large scale generation of council properties for rent would help control the housing market because the only thing currently controlling the housing market is estate agent valuations, not social requirements. Poor people need social housing now.",
