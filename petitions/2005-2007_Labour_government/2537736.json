            "background": "The current lesilation is making criminals and creating disrespect for the law out of a growing mass of youngsters. Taking legal action to stop their music use of the internet is not the answer. We must do for the internet what we did for radio and make it free at source but ensure that the music creators get paid. This can only be done by govermnent intervention and a small levy on ISPs/MP3 devices would solve the problem. This has been calculated by leading US universities to be as little as $5 per month per broadband user to create the same revenue as the CD industry did. We have the technology to create a fair compensation system for creators and performers.  The goverment is requested to consider legsilation for a levy to benefit the public and the creators of music.",
