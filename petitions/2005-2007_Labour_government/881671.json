            "background": "There is a serious lack of allotments throughout the country and demand is on the increase.\nPeople want to grow their own produce for a number of reasons such as health, environmental issues etc. But the most important reason is our children\u2019s health.\nWe appreciate the need for affordable housing but surely land could be set aside for allotments.\nI suggest that new allotments are set up with a portion of the site designated to a local school.\nBenefits:-\nFresh produce for pupils.\nPupils learn about healthy living.\nInteraction with the other plot holders creating a community spirit.\nAllotmenteers would love to help teach young people about growing vegetables.\nInteraction between generations and hopefully create respect.\nParents growing vegetables in the gardens due to pressure from their youngsters, promoting healthy living and a reduction in obesity.",
