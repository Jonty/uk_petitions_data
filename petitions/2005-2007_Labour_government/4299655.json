            "background": "Gordon Brown says he is a man for families, yes there are a number of families that have more than five members.  If your like me, or you agree that the goverment is discriminating agianst larger families and think double road tax on 4x4 and MPV's is unfair, sign this petition lets stop discrimination again large families.  Why forsce a large family to have two cars when one would do the job. Why not go for a fairer tax like, taxing the cc classes, the higher the cc the greater the tax.  Taxing the family's size isn't fair. Grow up and get real mr brown, your hitting the family right where it hurts.  The funny thing is if we get rid of the Mpv/4x4 and buy two smaller cars, bet your bottom dollar you'll introduce the second car tax and hit us again that way.",
