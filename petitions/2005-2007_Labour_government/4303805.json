This period will give opportunities for schools, civic, public and local organisations to organise suitable peaceful events, promoting alternatives to violence and war. The period will give schools a time to focus on education in conflict resolution at all levels from personal situations to international situations.\nIt will give our leaders and the population in general time to reflect on how peace can be achieved in our personal lives and between countries.  It will give an opportunity for us to learn how to negotiate  and the art of diplomacy, rather than preparations for violent conflict.",
