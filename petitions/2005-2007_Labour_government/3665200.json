            "background": "Virgin Media customers now feel left out, as they have lost Sky One, Sky Travel, Sky News, and Sky Sports News. They have lost access to some great television shows (such as Lost and 24). Also, re-introducing these channels will reduce the number of people trying to download episodes illegaly, which would therefore reduce the amount of time that people need to set up fake torrents and the like.",
