            "background": "When I buy a legitimate, legal copy of a DVD in a shop I am invariably forced to sit through warnings about DVD copying and many irritating non skip adverts. I have paid for a legitimate copy of the DVD and to not want to endure extremely irritating advertising or copyright warnings every time I play my legitimate copy. I should be able to skip through these, as I can with a video. I request that all DVDs should have such adverts and warnings available if necessary but that it should be possible to progress to playing the film as soon as the DVD loads. Anything else actually encourages the illegal modification of the DVD to make it more usable, the opposite of what the copyright warnings intend to happen.",
