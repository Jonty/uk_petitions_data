The way in which it is being done is illegal as we should be made redundant. Yet they are simply replacing us with permanent members of staff. Our terms and conditions state we should have equal rights to our permanent staff although it is clear this is not the case. Over 6000 FTA's will lose their jobs despite long and loyal service.",
