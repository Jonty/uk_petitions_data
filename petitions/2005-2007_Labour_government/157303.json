        "background": "In many areas of China (eg Beijing), dogs over 35cm have to be handed over to be destroyed in response to their rabies problem - many dogs are being forcibly removed from families or are simply being clubbed to death in the street by officials. \nThis is completely inhumane & there is no way of telling how many dogs are being killed in a totally unaccteptable & cruel way.\nThis policy is also not effective in combatting rabies.\nIn Beijing, there is a suspicion this policy relates to the 2008 Olympics & many Animal Welfare groups are calling on people to boycott the Olympic Games in protest.",
