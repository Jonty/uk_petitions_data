            "background": "The council tax is levied to pay for local services. To make the system much fairer the charge should be based on the cost of those services how much the property in question uses. For example if the cost of providing a rubbish removal were based on how much rubbish the household actually produces then the system would be much fairer both for single parent families & for retired people living alone as they would not have to pay to support a large number of people living in a large mansion or a large number of people sharing a residence in shifts.",
