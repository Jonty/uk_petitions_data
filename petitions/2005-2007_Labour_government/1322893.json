        "background": "If stand outside a busy train station, shopping centre or a similar place and watch carefully one will notice that there are significant number of people in our society who are suffering from mental conditions associated with distress and/or dysfunctions involving cognitive, emotional, behavioural and interpersonal impairments.   \n\nApart from the obvious human suffering these people can not fully contribute to the country\u2019s economy due to their psychological situation. However if the government provide help and guidance to the citizen to monitor their mental well-being regularly and provide support and care where necessary this human and financial suffering can be avoided. \n\nJust to clarify, what I\u2019m proposing is to introduce a preventative mental care service instead of the current mental breakdown care service.",
