            "background": "The government, since the early 1990's has supported the Investors in People (IiP) National Standard. It has proven to be one of the best investments organisations can make. To stop unscrupulous organisations poaching well trained staff, by offering higher salaries instead of developing their own people, the time has come for the stick as well as the carrot. This will help as an incentive to dynamic and ethical companies, the leaders, and force the tardy ones to improve their performance in managing their people.",
