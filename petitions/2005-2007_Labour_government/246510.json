            "background": "Hi. My name is Samantha Mitchell i am 15 years old and i live in Cheshire. I would like to make advertising guns illegal, im talking about anytype of guns, beebee guns, air rifles.I know that guns are needed in the armed forces and the unifomed services, but to be able to walk into a corner shop that sells guns is ridiculous.there is a shop that has an advertisment and pictures of all the different types of guns out side thier shop. Now hundreds of people go past this shop every single day, most of these people use this road that this shop is on  to take thier children to school what kind of an impression do you think that gives children? well.. ill tell you it is saying to them that buying and using guns is ok and that it is allowed, well its not or it shouldnt be anyway.\n     I know asking you to make guns illegal is a big thing to ask but to remove all adverts from shop windows is not alot to ask is it !!\nSamantha Mitchell age15.",
