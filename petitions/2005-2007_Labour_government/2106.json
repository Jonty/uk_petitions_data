        "background": "We all know of the Islamic terrorist or extremist training camps in the middle east. What isn't so widely talked about are the evangelical 'Jesus Camps' that are on the rise in the USA, which in some ways are worse because they are teaching very young children (who are forced to attend) that they should die for God and wage war on the enemies of God, where the Islamic ones tend to focus on teenagers and adults. I request that the Prime Minister asks the USA why such camps are allowed to exist, and makes an attempt to have them closed before it's too late. I and others who have seen videos of these camps online are extremely shocked and worried that they are being given a 'blind eye' when the Islamic versions of the same thing are hunted down.",
