            "background": "It is near impossible for average consumers to readily understand the full life-cycle environmental impacts of their purchases. We request a simple mandatory rating scheme to help consumers identify environmental best choices between similar goods and services.\n\nWe understand that this is a complex task which may impose obligations on suppliers, require EU legislation and also involve some degree of subjectivity in any rating system. However, such schemes as energy ratings for electrical goods and homes have already proved succesful. The extension of such schemes to other goods and services should not prove impossible.\n\nSuch a scheme is a neccessity if we are to empower consumers to be able to make environmentally friendly purchasing decisions, thereby reducing our impact on the planet and reduce the extent of climate change.",
