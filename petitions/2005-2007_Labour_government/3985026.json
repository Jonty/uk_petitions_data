            "background": "A concerning new idea is currently in circulation that could see any vehicle made between 1973 and 1995 being banned from using the road, this is grossly unfair, it is removing the right for people to choose, and frankly it has nothing to do with the environment as most cars over 15 years old are in the scrapyards already, the ones that survive are more likely to be well maintained by caring owners, this is especially the case with owners of classics of 25 years plus. Surely the police would be better employed doing other things rather than booking and fining drivers for daring to drive a perfectly otherwise road legal car which just happens to have been manufactured in the 1970's or 80's.",
