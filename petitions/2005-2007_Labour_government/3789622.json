        "background": "Education is important to everyone so everyone should pay.  Why should Council Tax payers carry most of the burden? By moving education funding from Council Tax to Income Tax everyone will pay for the nation's education at very little increase in Income Tax, while the unpopular Council Tax will drastically reduce. This would be particularly welcomed by older home-owners who no longer have children to be educated.",
