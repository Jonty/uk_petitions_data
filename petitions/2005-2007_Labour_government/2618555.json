            "background": "The stamp duty thresholds have never increased relatively to house price rises and the chancellor just allows the profits to roll in. Its time to get realistic. It won't be long for the average house to cost over \u00a3250,000 with buyers having to foot the \u00a37500 stamp duty bill. Also, why can't stamp duty be charged marginally like income tax is. So if a property cost \u00a3260,000, you would pay 1% of the first \u00a3250,000 then 3% of the remaining \u00a310,000. But tax isn't supposed to be fair.",
