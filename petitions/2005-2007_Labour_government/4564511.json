            "background": "The British government has successfully retrieved the 15 sailors and marines from the Iranians. The Iranians have in turn requested a goodwill gesture. What better gesture could we make than by shifting the weekend from Sat / Sun to Thurs / Fri? \n\nCurrently, there are only 3 concurrent work days between much of the Middle East and the West. Qatar and Bahrain have tried to overcome this difficulty by shifting to a Fri/Sat weekend. \n\nA UK shift from Sat/Sun to Thurs/Fri (thus paving the way for other Western countries to follow the example of the UK) would allow the UK and the Middle East to communicate and conduct business on the same 5 days. By the UK making this goodwill gesture it would show the President of Iran how much the UK is willing to cooperate with other peoples.",
