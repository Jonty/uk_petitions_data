            "background": "London is a beautiful city, but many of us feel as if it's blighted by crime such as burglary, mugging and other violent offenses against innocent citizens. A 'zero tolerance' policy helped turn the crime-blighted New York of the 1970s and 1980s into one of the safest large cities in the US today. \n\nWe, as residents of London, as visitors to London, and as lovers of the city of London, believe that a similar policy - taking the streets back from the hands of the criminals - could make London a great place to live again, and petition the government to help make this happen.",
