            "action": "reform the secondary education system to offer all children a choice between an academic education and a vocational education in well-disciplined, well-resourced schools, thus providing every child with the opportunity to fulfil their individual potential and make a worthwhile contribution to society.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "All children should be given a real choice to choose between academic schools offering traditional subjects such as history, languages, business studies and sciences; and vocational schools focusing on developing skills for a range of practical careers such as hairdressing, plumbing, retail or catering.  This should ensure that every child engages with learning and leaves school with qualifications relevant to a possible future career.\nAll children should also learn 'life skills' such as basic finances, politics, citizenship and ICT, and be expected to gain a sound level of numeracy and literacy.\nThis then provides the country with skilled and qualified people to fill all the roles needed in a successful economy, allows academic children to thrive in subjects that suit them and ensures other children leave school appropriately qualified and motivated to find a career and make a positive contribution to society, thus reducing the class divide the current system seems to be fostering.",
