            "background": "With the new laws on banning the use of mobile phones (without a hands free kit) whilst driving, along with penalties on eating & drinking, & also the possibility of banning smoking whilst driving; I thought it only right that Sneezing was added to the list !\nI personally believe sneezing to top the list of dangerous acts, as you momentarily enter a world of relaxation & orgasmic pleasure.\nLet's feel even more like prisoners in our own vehicles - let's STOMP OUT SNEEZING !!!",
