        "background": "The Government has abdicated its responsibilty for the funding of the National Health Service by setting up the system of Trusts, not just Trust Hospitals but the Trusts used to fund the Hospitals, an extreemly complex system \n\nI call on the Government to remove this system of funding. \n\nThis system is expensive using money better used directly in hospitals.\n\nFunding of all hospitals should be the sole responsibilty of Government  directly and the Minister of Health and his department should be fully accountable for loss of services in Hospitals\n\nHospitals should firstly be funded to bring all hospitals up to a standard greater that the private sector, all Hospitals should be centres of excellence.\n\nPrivate funding should not be used in hospitals due to their nature of  working for profit, this should include the capital expenditure for buildings etc.",
