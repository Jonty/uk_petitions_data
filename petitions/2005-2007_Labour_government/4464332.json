            "background": "Female circumcision is already proscribed in UK Law.\n\nMale child circumcision is a traditional practice within some religious communities.  Surgeons and Muslim Groups pressure for it to be performed on the NHS. \n\nEveryone has the right to manifest religious belief, but that right is not absolute.  It may be limited to protect the rights and freedoms of others.  The rights of the parents to circumcise their children are however in conflict with the rights of the child to autonomy, privacy, dignity and protection from cruel inhuman or degrading treatment.\n\nMale circumcision removes a normal body part with mechanical, sensory and immune functions.  The government has a right, if not a duty, to take steps to abolish it even though to do so would be in conflict with the rights of the parents.\n\nMale child circumcision may be performed for therapeutic reasons where strictly justified to treat disease.",
