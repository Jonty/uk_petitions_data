            "background": "St George's day is a key day in English heritage yet as an Unofficial bank holiday it is rarely celebrated, making st Georges day an official bank holiday will remind people to celebrate their English heritage and re-enforce the patriotism in England that is rapidly diminishing. The st Georges cross is only seen flying among people on key sporting events, rarely does it fly for pride's sake, a day a year where people of england can fly their flags and reflect on their great and noble heritage would greatly increase the respect for this country among its own people.",
