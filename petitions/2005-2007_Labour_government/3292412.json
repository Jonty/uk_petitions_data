            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The whole concept of road charging is to cut down on congestion and was supposedly to help the environment. if car tax is abolished, and instead more fuel duty was charged, then those who drive less will have a benefit, and those who pollute more by driving more will be penalised more. Any extra revenue can be ploughed back into the road infrastructure, plus there will be no need to build a complex monitioring infrastructure that will cost millions of pounds of taxpayers money, will take nearly ten years to introduce will potentially invade privacy and will be conceived as a stealth tax.\n\nBy increasing the duty on fuel, it can be introduced virtually immediately, will be revenue neutral, and I believe will have a wide support throughout the country.\n\nI respectfully submit my petition.",
