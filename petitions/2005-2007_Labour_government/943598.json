        "action": "set up an independent enquiry into the FSA's supervision of the Scottish Widows demutualisation.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At the time of the Scottish Widows demutualisation in 2000, the company had a black hole in its accounts of \u00a31.5bn in relation to Guaranteed Annuity Rate (GAR) policy liabilities, in a similar manner to Equitable Life, which went bust in 2000. Since the demutualisation took place while the 'Equitable Life Case' was before the courts and since the FSA had been closely monitoring the GAR liabilities of the life companies since the Equitable Life crisis blew up, it is clear that the FSA were aware of the exact nature and extent of the GAR liabilities of Scottish Widows, and yet they took no steps to ensure that Scottish Widows policyholders were properly informed of this matter, even during the demutualisation process itself, where disclosure of such matters is required by law. In failing to act the FSA knowingly failed in its duty to protect consumer interests. A similar petition is currently being considered by the Committee on Petitions of the European Parliament.",
