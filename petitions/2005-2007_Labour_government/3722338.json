            "background": "At present the microgeneration industry and in particular small businesses installing microgen products are finding the system of monthly grant allocations extremely disruptive to their businesses. Many customers are ready to go ahead but unable to receive funding. We petition the prime minister to make enough funding available so that the microgeneration industry can continue to grow rather than the present situation of severe restriction. This would be in line with  the 2006 energy review which called for the increased support for this industry and would allow the UK to move closer to meeting CO2 reduction targets.",
