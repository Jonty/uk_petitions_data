            "background": "Women receive their state pension at age 60, many men have been compulsorily retired, eg by the civil service, at age 60 (before ageism was outlawed in 2006).\nThose still under the age of 65 in April 2008 will be disadvantaged by the abolition of the 10% rate of income tax and most will recoup only a proportion of this loss by the introduction of the 20% rate.\nThese \"pensioners\" (and your government must acknowledge that they are pensioners since it is your government providing their pensions) will not benefit from the increases in the age related tax allowances until they reach the age of 65. Hence from April 2008 until they reach the age of 65 they will be worse off than at present.\nIt is therefore disingenuous of your chancellor to claim - without qualification - that his budget \"helps pensioners\".",
