            "background": "We the undersigned petition the PM to change the way Incapacity Benefit is determined following major surgery. Hospital staff should automatically be allowed to issue a sick note for either 3 months or 6 months depending on the seriousness of the condition so that patients don't have to queue outside a doctors surgery in order to obtain a sick note when they should be recouperating. This adds to their stress and sets back recovery. Incapacity Benefit should automatically be granted for people with major surgery and they should not have to show their scars to prove what operations they have had in order to get a sick note. This system as it stands is a disgrace and bureaucrats should reconsider the implications of this current system as it stands. \nPlease please help change it.",
