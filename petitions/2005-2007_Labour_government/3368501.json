        "background": "The Government introduced an all-employee share plan scheme in 2000 to encourage employers to offer shares to employees.  Yet, the scheme does not go far enough.  A variety of tax relief should be offered, including:\n\n- Income Tax relief on dividends arising from employee shares;\n- Corporation Tax relief on profits allocated to the purchase of employee shares;\n- Stamp Duty relief on the purchase of shares by employees;\n- Capital Gains Tax relief on the gains arising from the sale of employee shares.\n\nThis would go a long way to encouraging more employee shareholding, which is vital for competitiveness in a \"global\" economy.",
