            "background": "This will make sure that glass bottles are recycled as most bottles will then be returned for the deposit, retailers will then recycle them, youth's won't smash them on the ground like they do all over the UK causing environmental problems for years. This will save making new glass which in turn is better for the environment. This will be a win win situation.",
