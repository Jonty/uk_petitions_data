        "action": "Allow people to opt out of the NHS and then scrap the NHS for school leavers, enabling them to set up monthly payment scheme's (similar to pension scheme's) for private health care.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "since the creation of the NHS it has continually overspent on it's yearly budget, peoples demands have consistently exceeded the NHS'S ability to deliver. The probems of the NHS are too numerous to mention in a thousand character petition, everybody knows it is the biggest failure in modern Britain today. Let those passionately in favour of the NHS continue useing it for themselves and allow me to opt out. Our NHS has been allowed to fall so far behind, it is now terminal just like a cancer that has progressed to such an extent through a body until it becomes untreatable. The facts are that the NHS now sucks in 20% of our taxes. School leavers would be told that they have to pay monthly subcriptions to a private health service. The facts are that 20% of our taxes are used to fund the NHS, school leavers and people that opt out of the NHS should in theory pay 20% less taxes and therefore will find themselves in a stronger finnancial position to afford private healthcare.",
