        "background": "Increasingly companies are penalising customers who make payments by any means other than a direct debit. This may be in the form of an 'administration fee' or a 'discount'. Such charges are rapidly increasing with some being over ten percent of the actual monetary exchange. Furthermore such charges penalise those without bank accounts or those who do not have any faith in or who have had bad personal experience with direct debits. Whilst it is easy to argue the consumer has a choice this is a choice that is rapidly diminishing and a legislative stop is now required.",
