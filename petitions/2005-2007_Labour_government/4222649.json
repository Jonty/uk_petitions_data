        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe the 10p tax band should be re-instated because  it is unfair to  workers on low incomes.\n \nTax credits are not an answer to removing the low rate of tax for these reasons:\n\n1) Most low income earners are living\nwith a partner and do not qualify for \nsignificant tax credit. For example a couple with joint income of \u00a324,000\nare losing about \u00a3430 in tax and get no tax credits (according to the tax credit website calculator)\n\n2)Whilst a low income earner may be living with a partner with a\ngood income who could apparently afford to support them, he/she may have other commitments such as making hefty maintenance payments for children.\n\n3)Tax credits are complicated & expensive to administer and fraught with \nunder & overpayment problems.\n\n4) Tax credit claimants have to go through the stress & humiliation of being means tested and may be accused of cohabitation, when no such sexual relationship or financial support exists.\n\n5) It is humiliating for a person in a relationship, who is working full time, to not be able to pay their half of the ever increasing bills, simply because their tax has been increased to an unfair level.",
