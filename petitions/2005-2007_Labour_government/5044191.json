St Georges day is now celebrated by drinking continental lager whilst watching european football!\nBy making old traditions such as morris dancing and maypole dancing part of the national curriculum, this will increase community spirit in our over subscribed multi culture.\nThis should also be extended to regional variations, such as caber tossing, leek tossing, welly tossing, apple bobbing, cheese rolling.  It should be law that every resident of this once great country attends at least 6 local events (church fetes, school fairs etc) per annum",
