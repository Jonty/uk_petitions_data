            "background": "This is the main road from Carlisle-Barrow stretching 100 miles. There is no dual carriageway & in places is barely single file. This is unacceptable when you look at road infrastructure elsewhere. The railway exists as do the shipping ports of Barrow/Workington but this road needs upgrading now. With potential major job losses in Cumbria approaching, new businesses will only be attracted here if they can see that a viable transport infrastructure exists. This road needs upgraded as much as the A66 needs dualled in its entirety. It will not only appease prospective future employers, but also tourists, whom will benefit from improved roads between Barrow & South Lakes to the West Coast towns as well as the Western Lakes & Carlisle. This improved road can link into the A66 at Workington to ensure Cumbria has a modern road network. Please support this petition to make journeys around this beautiful County of Cumbria more enjoyable for everyone.",
