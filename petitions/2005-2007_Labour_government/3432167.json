            "background": "Persons who have to drive on our inadequate roads for work have been hammered for tax since the 18k rule was abolished. Many have no choice but to still run a company vehicle. This has effected the working mans pay, not the company they are employed by. Others have taken a company van at a lower tax rate. This unfortunately has the effect of making housing estates into white van show rooms. Still others have purchased their own vehicle and claim the 25pence per mile back. The servicing of these vehicles often becomes a luxury and must have a negative effect on road safety. Let us not forget the amount the revenue allows us to claim per mile has not changed in years, even with the sharp increase in fuel costs. Business should pay this not the employee surly? I am calling for a review of the 18k rule. Perhaps if this was re introduced and raised to 30k persons who actually work very hard on stressful roads will not be penalised for simply going to work.",
