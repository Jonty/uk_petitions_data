            "background": "Outside of the home counties, public transport is a joke, and a rather poor and tired one at that. In most towns, and certainly in all rural areas it is almost essential to have a car, but the building regulations under this government have been changed to remove the requirement to provide any parking. As such, we have blocks of 40 flats being built, which will have 40 cars owned by the residents, in areas with no parking, minimal public transport, but all amenities and shopping miles away.\nBy providing a parking space for every dwelling, it will improve the environment by preventing people from driving round and round to find parking, improve safety by not having cars blocking all the streets, and allow those with disabilities or children easy access to their own homes.",
