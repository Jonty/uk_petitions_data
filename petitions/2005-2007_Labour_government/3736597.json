This will cause a reduction in income from vehicle taxation, insurance, fuel sales, car sales and tourism to name a few. Unemployment will go up because it will become too expensive to live more than a short bus journey from work (include me). My suggestion is a factory and retail site at the end of every street, as in Victorian times.",
