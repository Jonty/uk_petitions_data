Some mothers may not wish to return to work but you can;t do this as you are not supported to stay at home.  Money is the main factor to women/men staying at home I think if at least 1 parent is working then another parent should be allowed to stay at home, being Mother or Father.  I enquired about this and was advised I would be given \u00a3150 extra on top of my tax credits if I was to stay at hime now as if that could support a family, isn't it best for a parent to raise their child not childcare, think of all the asbo's that could be saved.",
