        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "4x4's are very heavy vehicles with poor fuel consumption rates and high pollution figures.  They are usually driven at high speeds, well in excess of the national maximum, often in the outside lane of the motorway.  These vehicles are usually driven very aggresively, coming up very fast and close to the vehicle in front, and often with headlights on.  The lights  are high compared to normal cars and help to cause fear in many divers.  The very heavy weight compared to normal cars increases the stopping distance and also increases the likelyhood of serious damage or injuries if involved in a high speed accident.",
