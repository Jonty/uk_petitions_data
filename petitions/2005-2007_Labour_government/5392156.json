            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In most cases this probably would be alright.  My concern, however, is that some non-resident parents may abuse the child(ren) emotionally, and/or sexually, and/or physically; in  whatever way the parent does this it will obviously harm the child(ren)and the effect may last into adulthood or even be lifelong.  If access is granted to the non-resident parent any concerns expressed by the resident parent, resulting from issues raised by the child(ren), should be treated very seriously, and contact stopped, until they have been fully investigated; such concerns MAY be raised maliciously but surely the welfare of the child(ren) should be paramount and contact only resumed if Social Sevices are CONVINCED that no abuse has taken place or is likely to take place.",
