        "background": "The government should realise that not every 4x4 user lives in a city or town. The 4x4 vehicles were designed and intended for rural use and where it can be proved by post code areas for example, the fee should be reduced to pre budget levels. They have killed off industry and are now killing of agriculture. They are arrogant and pathetic with no understanding of rural industries or affairs. A lot of 4x4 vehicles have a much lower C02 rating than the majority of commercial and public transport vehicles. Please vote to show your opposition to this money raising con trick.",
