        "background": "Gurkha Tul Bahadur Pun won the Victoria Cross by single-handedly charging Japanese machine-gun posts in Burma during World War 2.  His citation reads : \"His outstanding courage and superb gallantry in the face of odds which meant almost certain death were most inspiring to all ranks and beyond praise\".  He was there when the British Empire needed him.  Will Britain not attempt to repay the debt it owes him by allowing him into the UK?  It has been reported that officials decreed that he has \"failed to demonstrate that you have strong ties with the UK\".  This decision beggars belief and must be reversed immediately, to show the honour that this hero deserves in his remaining days and to attempt to erase the stain on this country's reputation that this crass decision has created.  This should not be a nation that turns its back on heroes.",
