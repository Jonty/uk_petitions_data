        "background": "I am a student and live outside the city of Glasgow however I attend the University of Glasgow.  I drive into the city every morning and quite honestly am enraged by the mess that the council has made of the road network to \"attempt\" to get more people off the roads and on to public transport.  Firstly parking outside the city in areas with train stations and commuting is impossible, as parking does not exist. Examples Balloch and Milngavie train station. So I am forced to drive in directly to the city where congestion has been made even worse by the introduction of bus lanes. Where the buses are \"supposedly free to move\" quickly.  This is not the case, as buses often have to rejoin lanes etc causing further chaos to traffic.  The implications are simple congestion is worse than ever, as the same volume, if not greater volume of cars is now forced on to an even smaller area of road.",
