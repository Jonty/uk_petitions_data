            "background": "As people with Autistic Spectrum Disorder age the provisions, support, services and care seem to be harder to access. Autistic Sepectrum Disorder is a life long condition and for this reason the services, support, funding and care should also be life long. If anything the services, funds and support should become more avaliable as the person is no longer in a safe education setting and may not have family to support them as they grow older.",
