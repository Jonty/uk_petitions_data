            "background": "I am suggesting that the Current Road Fund Licence is to be scrapped in favour of adding a small increase in fuel taxation. This will prevent \"tax dodging\" and will also mean those road users who use more fuel either by driving more or by using less fuel efficient vehicles will pay more. It also has the benefit of being seen as \"green taxation\". No complicated systems and databases are necessary and will free up resources of the overstretched Police. From rough calculations the average motorist will only need to expect to pay 0.25p per litre of fuel to easily cover the revenue of current charges. It also means foreign vehicles currently using our roads are paying their way. This system already operates in several EU countries to great effect.",
