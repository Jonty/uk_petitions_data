        "action": "introduce effective regional policies to rid our inland urban areas of herring gulls",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Herring gulls have migrated to inland areas, far beyond their native, coastal habitats. The population is able to thrive in urban areas due the copious rubbish left strewn through our cities' streets. The gull population is now out of control in many areas and we urge the Government to look at this issue with great urgency. Gulls cause misery to thousands of local residents through sleep deprivation thanks to their incessant early morning squawking. Profuse amounts of gull faeces tarnish our buildings and vehicles. In the breeding season, gulls become very aggressive and have been known to attack and injure humans. Whilst steps have been taken in some areas to curb the spiralling population, it is now evident that oiling the birds\u2019 eggs is simply not an effective means of tackling this huge anti-social nuisance and more forceful steps are now required to rid our inner-cities of this growing menace.",
