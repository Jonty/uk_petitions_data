            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Freeman Hospital Trust in Newcastle upon Tyne has brought in a new parking charge system that does away with concessions for the Chroncically Sick & Disabled Persons that have no choice but to use the hopsital car park when visiting the hopsital for routine appointments. A Daily Charge ranging from \u00a31.10 per hour for the first 4 hrs up to a \u00a312 maximum per day has been brought in by Trust Chiefs, who claim they need to balance their books. This affects all visitors & patients including those that need to undergo Kidney Dialyasis at the hospitals renal unit. Accordingly it is unfair & unjust as it has been done without consultation with patients.",
