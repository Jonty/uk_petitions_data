            "background": "We request that Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber intervenes and reverses the decision to make Lee Mead, the new lead in 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat', wear a wig in the production opening at The Adelphi theatre in July. Lee Mead was selected by a public vote on a BBC television show which was funded using the Licence Fee, and many voters cast their vote based on his hair. We respectfully request that this is taken into account and that Lee's curls are freed.",
