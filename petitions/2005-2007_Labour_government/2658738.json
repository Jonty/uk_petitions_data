        "background": "My wife, Margaret Angela Owen, retired last year after having served Manchester Education Committee for more than 40 years as a classroom teacher.  Her most recent headteacher (at King David Junior School, Manchester) would confirm that Margaret was a very able teacher and her students would agree also, I'm sure.  Personally, although I might be slightly biased, I believe her to be patently outstanding and highly intelligent and always gave of her not inconsiderable best to the children.  This great career, undisturbed by any desire to become a school head, deserves more than just a \"Thank You\" and I would urge you to grant this petition - honour her, please!",
