            "background": "A proposal has been put forward by AWA UK on behalf of Ericsson & '3' to build a 12 metre tall Mobile base station on the cobbled area next to the pavement on Buckingham Hill adjacent to Tintagel Drive. \n\nThis is a predominantly residential area, and the base station would dominant the landscape, being far taller than any surrounding structures. Plus the fact that is would be unsightly, and that there are additional potentiel (but as yet unproven) health risks, coupled with potential negative impact on local house prices.\n\nPlease support this case, as this really is not an appropriate location for such a structure, especially when there are a number of loal areas e.g. Frimley Fuel Allotments, already used by mobile operators for identical operations. \n\nThanks for your time and help in supporting this petition.",
