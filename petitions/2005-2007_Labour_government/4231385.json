            "background": "Further Education Lecturers in Northern Ireland have had a long running campaign for pay parity with teachers in schools.\nThe employers agreed to pay parity in 2001 but did not implement it. Since then government has taken control over lecturers' pay and imposed a cap on public sector pay.\nLecturers have met with Secretary of State Peter Hain in a bid to have the cap lifted. He has said he accepts in principle that lecturers should have pay parity but that would breach government's current pay policy.\nCollege lecturers are only asking for fairness - they do a similar job to school-teachers and deserve the same pay and salary structures.",
