        "background": "Dear Prime Minister,\n\nI am a long suffering driver who uses the Carrington Bridge (which crosses the river Severn) to the south of Worcester. This Bridge suffers from horrendous traffic jams on its approaches at most times of the day not just the peak periods.\n\nThe nearest crossing point to the north is straight through Worcester City centre, to the south it is the M50.\n\nA recent Worcestershire County council report (July 2006) stated that the bridge was 86% over capacity with 33000 vehicles using it daily.\n\nThe report also goes on to say that the District Councils and the Chamber of Commerce have expressed strong concerns about the impacts of this congestion on the local economy.\n\nI recently sat in a queue and watched helplessly as an ambulance struggled to get through congestion caused as a result of a lack of capacity at this very important and congested pinch point.\n\nI therefore Petition the Prime minister to initiate a survey to establish the extent of the problem and then take steps to build a suitable second bridge to cope with the current high demand.\n\nThank you\n\nMark Curtlin",
