            "background": "Prime Minister Its time for people to recognise the good works of the Catholic Church.\nMissionaries Continue to devote lives to God and his suffering people all over the World , no matter the Religions or none of these people.\nMissionaries provide access to education , medical , health , employment , food , water , social and community services , the needy are never turned away.\nSpiritual guidance is also provided to those , whom want these services it is not compulsory. \nMany missionaries die in service to God and his people , some are martyred , they do not wish glory or even recognition , these men and women whom serve.\nThe United Kingdom should return to the true faith , in communion with the Holy See.\nGovernment must recognise that King Henry is dead , that the time for Protesters is now Void. The Protestants had a legitimate right to turn from the Catholic Faith so many years ago , corruption had taken hold , rich & powerful people all over Europe had abused priveleges from God  eg , paying money to Bishops to take away sins this was disgraceful.\nThose days are over , allow Royal Family members to marry a Catholic and be able to claim the Crown as King or Queen of great country , the United Kingdom.",
