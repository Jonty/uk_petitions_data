        "background": "by increasing the speed limit to 50mph.,more people would be content to sit behind one at this speed rather than put themselves and others at risk by overtaking one at slower speeds at the most stupid of occasions.Also the technolgy in the modern heavy goods vehicle is far advanced than that of the vehicles onthe roads when the limits were intially set(i.e. braking systems of today are more than capable of stopping todays heavier vehicles).Bycracking down on middle lane hoggers,this will allow free movement across all three lanes.",
