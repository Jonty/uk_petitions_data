            "background": "This far from NICE organisation was set up, by our so called UK government, to make health decisions which only apply to the English and occasionally the Welsh.  NICE marginalises the English; it denies English taxpayers NHS drug treatments for certain Cancers, MS and Alzheimers.  Meanwhile it permits drugs to foreign nationals, including Americans, who have contributed nothing. E.g. the HIV cocktail, at a prox cost of \u00a317.5k per annum is not only prescribed to such people, but also to those gays who deliberately risk unsafe casual sex (bare backing): article in the Independent November 25, 2006.  To add insult to injury NICE has recommended tax funded schemes to those who are not ill.  E.g. infertility treatment, in a country which is hugely  overcrowded, and today has recommended that Heroin addicts should receive vouchers as a reward. What happened to Equal Human Rights for sick English people?",
