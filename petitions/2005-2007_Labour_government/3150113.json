Then, when finally getting through, sitting in a queue system and acruiing an increasing telephone bill, or simply getting too frustrated and hanging up. This so called service being tied in to favourable line suppliers filtering back to the client some of the excessive line costs. The other alternative, often linked to governmental services, is being shoved from pillar to post with deferal being a poorly concealed method of denying either service,response, or once again causing frustration, despair and abandonment.",
