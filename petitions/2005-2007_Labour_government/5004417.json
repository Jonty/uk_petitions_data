        "background": "The Eurovision song contest has become so political that it has lost all meaning. The idea of it being a \"song contest\" is lost to many nations who prefer to vote for their allies. The United Kingdom pays thousands if not millions of pounds towards this contest and yet we are treated unfairly during the voting. Therefore i believe that the UK should withdraw from the contest until a fair voting system is installed, which is unlikely to be long due to the massive British funding in the contest.",
