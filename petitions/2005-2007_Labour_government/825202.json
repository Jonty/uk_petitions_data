            "background": "I have been watching this show with increasing concern and dismay. Not only is Shilpa Shetty being referred to as a \"dog\" and \"the Indian\", which is clearly rude and abusive, there is also clear evidence of racism and intelerance towards other cultures. There have been mutiple instances that demonstrate this esp the one where one of the other English housemate made a recent comment 'Indians are always sick'. We have recently moved to the UK and is a contributing member of society paying taxes and making an honest living, it bothers me to see this kind of behaviour especially from the so-called \"young educated people\" of Britain. Shilpa is a respected, talented actress and a true achiever who has accomplished a lot on her own merit! She deserves a lot better, and needs to be protected against such blatant acts of racism and verbal abuse.",
