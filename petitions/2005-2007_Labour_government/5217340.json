        "background": "Due to the failing supply of natural gas from the seas surrounding the UK the Government is permitting coal gas to be produced again. This is blended into the main gas supply in increasing amounts (but as yet not in sufficient amounts to require appliances to be re-jetted.) This is both dangerous and re-introduces a toxic gas to the home, unknown to the people.",
