        "background": "UCAS are planning to change the university admission system so that prospective students must provide details of their parents' educational backgrounds. Preference will be given to those whose parents did not attend university.\n\nI believe that this logic is deeply flawed and that the long term effects on our society have not been considered.\n\nEvery child in this country who wishes to attend university should be given an equal chance to do so, no matter what their background is.",
