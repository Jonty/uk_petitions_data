If they do not gain access with your permission the next step they can take is to fine you up to \u00a31000 and then \u00a3200 for each day you refuse entry, this is an excessive fine which does not reflect the gravity of the alleged offence and should be scrapped or greatly reduced. Additionally and this is of greater concern make a forced entry into your house within as little as 24 hours. Surely this MUST contravene the human rights act",
