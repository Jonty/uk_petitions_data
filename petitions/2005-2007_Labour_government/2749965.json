It is also the cause of many health problems.\nWhy should this highly dangerous and addictive drug be legal when other substances that are on par with this evil are illegal. \nThe introduction of prohibition will free up much needed NHS and police resources, save lives and remove the constant misery from people's lives that alcohol causes.",
