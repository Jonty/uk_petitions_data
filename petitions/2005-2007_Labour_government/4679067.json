        "background": "It is disgusting and wholly undemocratic the way that Gordon Brown is assuming he is the next PM. Surely once Tony Blair resigns, the Deputy PM, John Prescott will hold the reigns until the new leader of the Labour Party is elected. Tony Blair has no right to 'promise' anyone the leadership once he resigns. He is already 'coaching' him and the media are reporting on the relationship between 'PM Brown' and Bush. This is NOT democracy.",
