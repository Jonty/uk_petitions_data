            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "With the recent introduction in London of 2 new free daily newspapers many find it hard to walk a few yards without having a newspaper or leaflet thrust in their direction. This is primarily a London-centric issue but has implications nationwide.\n\nThe practice of lining a short section of the street with multiple 'staff' adds to congestion and tension of passersby. The papers lead to a drop in environment quality due to papers left behind. The aggressiveness of the 'staff' handing out the newspapers due to obvious targets must be addressed. The practice of handing you a newspaper before you have even stepped off the bus must cease immediately due to safety reasons.\n\nIn short, by signing this petition, we agree that if we want a newspaper or leaflet advertising your wears we will pick one up ourselves from authorised locations. We also wish to feel unthreatened by sales tactics whilst going about our daily business.",
