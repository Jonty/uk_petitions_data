            "background": "1. Faith schools continue to perform an important and valuable function in modern society, allowing those for whom religion forms an important part of their identity to ensure their children are brought up in an environment where religious beliefs can be supported.  This option should not be limited to those wealthy enough to pay for private education, and State funding for faith schools ought to continue.\n\n2. However, it is of great concern that schools founded under the Academies scheme enable the religious views of their sponsors to be reflected in the content and teaching of the curriculum, while not being openly 'faith' schools, and eliminating in some areas parents' ability to choose a non-faith based teaching for their children.\n\n3. Stricter controls must be put in place to ensure that the rapidly proliferating Academies remain bias free.",
