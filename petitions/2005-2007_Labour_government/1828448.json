            "action": "Amend Section 172 of The Road Traffic Act 1988 and require the police to formally identify the driver of a car caught on speed camera without exorting a confession under duress as the Act currently requires.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Section 172 of the Road Traffic Act requires a motorist issued with a speed ticket to provide details of the driver. A fine is payable for witholding the information. If the driver and owner are the same, this is tantamount to demanding  a confession under duress. Under British Law and European Law, the accused is innocent until proven guilty and normally has the right to remain silent, but not if accused of speeding. The Road Traffic Act puts the accused in a worse legal position than if he had committed a serious felony. I regard this as a serious breach of human rights and would ask all citizens to sign this petition. Make a stand for justice.",
