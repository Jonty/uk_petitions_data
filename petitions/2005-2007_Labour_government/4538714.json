It would leave children in complete fear of their parents - any parent whose child(ren) fear him/her should be utterly ashamed - and probably wouldn't even improve the child(ren)'s behaviour since their obvious and natural reaction would be to make sure that the parent(s) didn't discover any misbehaviour.  Children DO need discipline but they also need love and understanding; how are they to get either with that sort of attitude towards them?",
