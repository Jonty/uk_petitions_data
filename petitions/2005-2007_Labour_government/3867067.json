            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are many government policies that seem to be conflicting with the desire to cut down on our carbon emissions.  For instance the big petrol companies are spending money on schemes to pump CO2 under the ocean floor to bury and capture it, but at the same time we are all working hard to recycle and hence NOT bury and capture carbon(!!).  Also the current love of hybrid cars doesn't take into account how much energy and carbon is produced in making them and replacing them after a shorter lifetime.  It may be more environmentally friendly to keep an old car running for many decades and not scrap and replace every ten years.\nI would encourage you to sign on the grounds of common sense.",
