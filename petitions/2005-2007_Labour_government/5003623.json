            "background": "Firstly I applaud the recent DVLA initiative to rid public roads of untaxed vehicles. As we know such drivers are more likely to have no insurance or MOT and are more likely to be involved in accidents.\n\nHowever the notion of crushing the untaxed vehicle is just wasteful. I propose that an otherwise safe and road legal vehicle (i.e. with an MOT) should be sold or auctioned off and the proceeds added into a pot of funds to compensate people who have been victims in an accident as a result of an uninsured driver\u2019s actions (i.e. sustained injury and / or vehicle damage).\n\nTo crush a safe and functional car represents a massive waste of energy and materials at a time when we need to be more mindful of squandering the planets limited resources.",
