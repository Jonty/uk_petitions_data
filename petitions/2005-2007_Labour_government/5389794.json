            "background": "The European Union Reform Treaty agreed in Brussels on 23rd June 2007 is the latest stage in the progressive transfer of British sovereignty to the EU. The treaty sets the foundation of the European super-state by creating the posts, and adopting the powers, of a sovereign state. It potentially undermines member countries' rights to National self-determination. It would  limit Britain's ability to apply political influence within the EU and in the world outside.  The government, and other parties, committed themselves to holding a referendum before further significant powers are transferred to the EU. In view of the significance of this treaty, its ratification should be the subject of a referendum.",
