            "background": "The British monarchy is one of the oldest surviving monarchies in the world and it remains a vital part of our government. Today Britian is facing a crisis of muli-cultralism and secessionism from within the country. In order to promote loyalty to the monarchy and its role and to promote a sense of common Brtish national identity that goes above cultural and religious differences we propose that the government should actively promote the teaching of the importance of the monarchy as a national symbol in schools and other government education facilities.",
