        "background": "The Lies: crumple zones reduce \"whiplash\" injuries. \n\nThe truths: \nWhiplash is caused by a massive and rapid deceleration and can actually be sustained from merely performing a high speed emergency stop.\nCrumple zones reduce insurance company payouts for whiplash injuries. \nThe scientific evidence was attained by experiments performed by car manufactureres which miraculously supported the implementation of a crumple zone system.\nCrumple zones are (conveniently) cheaper to produce as the front end of cars no longer have solid subframes but are of pressed steel of inferior and weaker metal.\nIn minor accidents the cars suffer considerably greater damage, accidents which would of been merely superficial once are now often \"right offs\". \nSince the introduction of crumple zones the number of people having to be cut from wreckage of higher speed accidents often with serious, life threatening or fatal injuries as there is no solid structure to stop the engine crushing the driver and passenger.",
