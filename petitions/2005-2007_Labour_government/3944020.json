            "background": "Last year a rogue element within the IAU came up with a contrived definition of a planet desgined to eliminate Pluto as one.  A rigged vote was then arranged after most delegates had either gone home or were preparing to retun home and unable to vote.  The Prime Minister should show that the UK is unwilling to countenance this act of intellectual terrorism and create specific UK legislation to reclassify Pluto as a planet and place a tax on all text books and websites that do not mention it as one.  The Prime Minister should go further and in an act of defiance should also rename Pluto as Yuggoth in honour of the father of modern gothic horror HP Lovecraft, who came up with the name for a ninth planet shrouded in ice and darkness before Pluto's discovery.",
