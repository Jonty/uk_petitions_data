            "background": "The actions Nestl\u00e9 in marketing their artificial baby milk is partly responsible for the deaths of around 1.5 million babies world wide each year.  The reason for this is the fact that according to UNICEF, \"Marketing practices that undermine breastfeeding are potentially hazardous wherever they are pursued: in the developing world, WHO estimates that some 1.5 million children die each year because they are not adequately breastfed. These facts are not in dispute.\"\n\nThe best solution to this problem would be for the UK government to ban the sale of Nestl\u00e9 products in the UK until their marketing practices are amended, but as a gesture, we would like to see a ban on the use of Nestl\u00e9 products in government departments in order to send a small sign of government discontent on this issue.",
