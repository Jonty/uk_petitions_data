            "background": "Most UK laws created by the last two administrations, and in particular the current Labour government, have not been thought through properly, frequently result in the opposite effect of that intended, and generally have a detrimental effect on life in the UK.  This is largely because of the pernicious affect of UK lobby groups and the kneejerking of the current generation of politicians who have only ever worked as politicians and hence wouldn't recognise a good law if one smacked them in the face.  As a result, until we get some decent politicans in the UK (don't hold your breath) we should ban the current ones from generating any more stupid laws.",
