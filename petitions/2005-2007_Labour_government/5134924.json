        "background": "The current maximum age for interested parties to join the Territorial Army is 43.  We believe that this should be increased to 50 for those without previous military experience and 55 for those with previous service.\n\nThis would mean that it is in line with the maximum recruitment age of the Royal Auxiliary Air Force (RAuxAF).\n\nNot only would this provide additional numbers of reservists but also people who may have previous military experience but who are currently being denied the opportunity to serve their country because of being a few years over the current maximum age requirement.\n\nIf any further proof should be needed that mature soldiers can play a critical part of a nations defence then it should be remembered that in Ancient Rome a large section of the early republican army was composed of Triarii and Princeps who were older and even regarded as more reliable than the younger Hastati.",
