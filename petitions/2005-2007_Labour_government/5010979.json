            "background": "Why is it that everything we buy today is made in areas such as Asia?\nIf you look on your clothes, footballs, toy cars, gaming software, lawn mowers or automobiles, the vast majority are produced overseas. \nWhy is it we cannot produce items for our selves like we did 30, 40, 50, 60 years ago?\nIf the government took steps to increase our industry then it could only benefit the economy and increase employment for our British citizens.\nWe should be looking to produce energy renewable goods and move ahead of other countries in this sector, like we have militarily.\nThere are some good areas of British production, but we could and should do much better.",
