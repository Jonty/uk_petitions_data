            "background": "The Family Law is well-overdue for being reviewed and revised. Women have such an immense advantage over men under this aspect of \"Law\". There is no gender equality; in fact, women have been increasing their advantages in this area for far too long!\nA man stands absolutely no chance of 'playing on a level playing field'; in fact, he may as well just GIVE UP!\nWe are not asking for anything other than to be given equal rights with women! Is this asking too much?\nWhere Family Law is concerned, \"equal rights\" just do not exist! Too many men's lives are absolutely devastated by the ramifications of decisions made by District Judges under this completely outdated system.\nI ask all people who agree with this to vote for it, please.",
