            "background": "MPs are currently in the position of 'fat cat' businessmen, able to vote themselves generous pay and pension increases regardless of how good a job they are doing. This causes much resentment and criticism, and is never likely to improve voter's opinion of them. Their pay should be treated more like a profit-sharing bonus. If they do a good job and the country does well they can be paid more. If the government makes a pig's ear of the economy, they should suffer like the rest of us. Their pay should not be linked to that of specific groups (such as senior civil servants), but to that of the population as a whole, since that is who they are supposed to be representing. For instance, MPs pay could be set at 3 times average national income. If this is \u00a325,000pa, MPs would get \u00a375,000pa (figures for illustrative purposes only). Ministers could be on a higher multiple, but still linked to the same figure.",
