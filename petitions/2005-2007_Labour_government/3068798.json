            "background": "War with Iran must not happen. It will lead to mass casualties and only make the world a more dangerous place for us all. \n\nWar with Iran cannot be justified. Iran has a legal right to nuclear power, just as we do. Mr Bush cannot accuse Iran of \u201cinterfering\u201d in Iraq either - it was America that interfered first by invading.\n\nThe REAL reason Mr Bush wants a war is because the Iranian government has now decided to trade oil in Euros, rather than in US Dollars. This is exactly what Saddam Hussein decided, just months before the invasion of Iraq. The power of the US Dollar, and thus the strength of the US economy, depends on it being used as the standard for the international oil trade. Now that Iran has chosen to trade oil in Euros, the US economy is under threat.\n\nThis war is NOT about nuclear weapons or terrorism; it is about the US economy. This is NOT a justified reason to kill Iranian civilians and our soldiers, or to invade a sovereign nation.",
