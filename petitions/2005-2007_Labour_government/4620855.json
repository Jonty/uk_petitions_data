            "background": "During New Labour's period in Government the majority of private sector defined benefit pension schemes have closed, decimating what was the best funded privately funded pension system in Europe, if not the world. To concentrate the Government's attention on legislation to maximise help for private sector workers and pensioners now forced to rely on uncertain money purchase schemes, the MPs pension scheme should be changed to a money purchase scheme identical to those comercially available.",
