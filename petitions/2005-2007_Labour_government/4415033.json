            "background": "The total weight limit of 3.5 tons for car and trailer is hopelessly outdated. Some cars alone weigh more than 2 tons, making it impossible to tow a small trailer or even a horsebox let alone another car on a trailer. I propose a revision that the combined weight does not exceed double the weight of the towing vehicle for all car driving licence holders. This weight limit could be gradually increased the longer the driving licence has been held up to a maximum of 7.5 tons combined weight without having to take out a separate licence.",
