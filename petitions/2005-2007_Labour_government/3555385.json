            "background": "After 35yrs succesfully raising money for local charities, the annual Shoreham-by-sea Bath Tub race has been cancelled due to increasing health and safety legislation and insurance costs.  Last year this event raised \u00a3250,000.\n\nThe race is entered by adults who are able to judge the risks for themselves and as a result the race should not be subject to the increasingly repressive health and safety legislation that has become a feature of modern-day Britain.",
