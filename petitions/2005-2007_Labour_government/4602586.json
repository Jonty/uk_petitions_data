From parking where they shouldn't to abusing innocent people, we all must have examples of frustration at the lack of standards in this country. No punishment follows, yet be accused of failing to submit a form to the Revenue and have a \u00a3900 fine. Guilty before proven innocent. I am setting up a website to list the grievances I have personally. Am I the last person in Britain with standards, a lone voice in the wilderness... I hope not. Britain, does it make you proud....?",
