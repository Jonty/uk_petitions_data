        "background": "When the SIA was created, the idea was to make Security Officers a professional body and thus increase their wage. When i signed up for a license i was told that security officers would be in the region of \u00a310 an hour. In reality this is closer to &6 an hour. The SIA is made up of members of the leading security companies. How can they justify charging \u00a3245 for a license RENEWAL when we see no benefits. Security companies just undercut to win contracts. While the SIA is allowed to do this, Security Officers will not be treated with the respect, nor the wages, they deserve. Sign this petition and get the most out of your jobs!",
