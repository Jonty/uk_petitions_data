            "background": "There is country-wide opposition to the introduction of fortnightly bin collection for perishable waste. \n\nLocal taxpayers and homeowners are pressuring their councils not to introduce this scheme and, where it has been introduced, a number of councils have seen the folly of the scheme - and re-instated weekly collections. \n\nAlso consider that, with the alternate weekly collection system, if you forget to put your bin out on the correct day - it will be four weeks before it is emptied and remember - we are promised hotter summers because of climate change/Global warming. The flies, maggots, rats and stench will be horrendous - and a significant threat to public health. \n\nOn the other hand - if you put your rubbish out too soon - you may be fined and get a criminal record for littering or fly-tipping. \n\nWe all know that we need to recycle as much as possible but we pay our exorbitant council taxes, which include the costs of collecting and disposing of our rubbish, so we should get the service  at least every week. \n\nSupport and sign this petition - for the good of us all.",
