            "background": "Ovarian Cancer is the 'Silent' Killer.  By the time a woman is aware of symptoms, it is often too late.  According to 2007 statistics quoted by Cancer Research, over 7,000 women are diagnosed each year and of these 4,400 will die.  Ovarian Cancer does not show up on a Smear Test but it can be detected early with the blood test 'CA - 125'.  This should be offered annually to all postmenopausal women and women in high risk categories.  My Mother died from this terrible disease at age 61 - a simple blood test might have saved her - it could save you.\n*(There were 2,920 fatal road accidents in 2006 - Department of Transport 5/10/07 compared to 4,400 deaths from Ovarian Cancer - all they needed was a blood test.)",
