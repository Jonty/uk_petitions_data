            "background": "It is increasingly frustrating to enter public car parks and those car parks owned by large stores to find that people have parked irresponsibly. We need to have consequenses for people that parked on cross hatching, park over two bays, parking in drop of zones for long periods of time.  Cars are constantly being damaged in car parks as it seems to be a free for all with little of no regulations once cars have left the highway.  Monitoring of Car Parks is neccessary as far to many vehicles are damaged by adjectenly parked vehicles who then drive away. We need to monitor considerate use of these areas as we would road use.",
