            "background": "These cameras use a similar technology to X-rays & are already used at airports.  It has been suggested in the press that the government is considering introducing these to monitor the streets.  They effectively can see through people's clothes to detect hidden objects; in effect you appear naked.  This is a gross invasion of privacy & is part of the rolling surveillance programme.  Please sign this petition if you don't want this introduced as legislation.",
