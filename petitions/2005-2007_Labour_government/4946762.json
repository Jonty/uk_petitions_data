        "background": "The private finance initiative is not an efficient way of delivering services. It seams to cost 4 star and deliver 2 star. The efficiency is particularly poor where the authority concerned does not fully enforce the full terms of the contract. The contracts state services shall be provided in a reasonable manner. Some case law needs to be developed to define reasonable so that the 4 star service the public is paying for is delivered. For the fund to work any person may give an example of poor performance to the fund which will investigate and take appropriate action. The fund initially should have a bias to court action to establish case law. One only needs to look at the reduction in bank charges to see how this approach could improve value for money.",
