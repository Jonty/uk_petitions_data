            "background": "As a student myself, i have come across teachers who haven't been the best and have taught out of textbooks- possibly due to complacency. I think that providing students with the chance to voice their opinion every so often is a good way of understanding how the teacher really is towards students as they can act differently to them than they do in the staff room; the survey also gives the students the oppurtunity to voice their opinion anonamously without fear of disrupt to their student teacher relationship. I also think that teachers should take a yearly exam on their subject in order to test them and make sure they are not just teaching out of textbooks.",
