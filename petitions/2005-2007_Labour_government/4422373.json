            "background": "British motorists demand the Government erect more illuminated information signs at every motorway entrance/exit slip road, providing motorists with essential information of forthcoming hazards, accidents etc, for the next section of motorway. This would stop uninformed motorists from unneccessarily entering a congested section of motorway. Thereby keeping the motorway clearer for emergency vehicles. Currently there are not enough information signs on our motorways. One before every entrance and slip road is of great importance for everyone's health and safety.",
