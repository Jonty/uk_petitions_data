        "background": "At present, more and more Local Councils have no choice but to adopt the Alternate Weekly Collection (AWC) of household waste in order to meet centrally imposed targets on recycling and avoid heavy fines and penalties from Government. AWC is unpopular and has contributed to dirtier, smellier and potentially less healthy communities. We believe Local Councils should be free to set their own recycling targets where residents demand the retention of weekly bin collection. Residents should be free to demand weekly waste collections and Councils encouraged to improve recycling through education, information and innovative services - rather than face fines and penalties and draconian new taxes.",
