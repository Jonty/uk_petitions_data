            "background": "Many millions of us were extremely proud when London won the bid to host the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic games.\n\nDespite the spiralling costs of the building programme we continue to support what promises to be a great historic event both for international sport and the UK.\n\nThe launch of the new brand and logo has come as a huge disappointment to the vast majority of people in the UK. At a time when the Olympic Committee should be encouraging and building support for the games, the new brand has fostered almost universal dissent and derision, and consternation at the incredible cost of such a poor design.\n\nAnother design should be sought with public consultation or the original logo should be restored.",
