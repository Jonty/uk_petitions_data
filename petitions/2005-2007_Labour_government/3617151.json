            "background": "Homeworkers are typically suffering around \u00a370 annually as a result of a tax on employers providing home broadband to ease homeworking.\n\n\nIf an employee is provided with broadband at home for the purposes of their work, then the employee must pay tax on the cost of providing it if the broadband is used or is even available for private use. \n\n\nWhen mobile phones were first introduced there was a taxable benefit of \u00a3200 imposed for their private use. Once they proliferated this taxable benefit was removed to recognise their importance to business. In the same way, home broadband has now proliferated as a work tool in line with the drive towards flexible and home working.\n\n\nWith 5 million people now working from home in the UK, this is rapidly becoming a significant \u2018stealth\u2019 tax on flexible working.\n\n\nI petition the Prime Minister to remove this disincentive to homeworking which clearly appears discriminatory against those who need or want to work from home.",
