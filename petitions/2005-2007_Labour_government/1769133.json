            "background": "lets just say a father is paying csa and there ex is spending the money on herself and new boyfriend and not on the child i feel that the money should be linked into a bank account by law where the ex cant touch it and then the child would have a nice lump some when there 16 + yrs what they can use to goto college or uni or setup home make something of there self so they dont need to be unemployed. And also csa should take into account when working money out the need to take into account of bills,expenses and other children and make it monthly payments then the money the child gets into the bank the mother then get stopped out of benefits please take this under advisement as this would benefit the future children and the government",
