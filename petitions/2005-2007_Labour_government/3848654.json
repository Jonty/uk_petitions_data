            "background": "The British Motorist pays around 250% in tax and duty on motoring fuel and yet people are claiming that this should be increased based on environmental and congestion reasons.\n\nFirstly, houses emit far more CO2 into the atmosphere than motorists and yet there is not call to put a massive duty on central heating systems.  Why not have a system similar to the propsed congestion charge.  Charge more for heating your house when its cold and demand is high.  This will never happen because it would be unpopular with the voter.\n\nAs for congestion: The motorist has paid billions into the treasuries coffers that should have been spent on roads.  If the govenment had spent the money correctly in the first place, then we wouldn't have the problems that we have now.\n\nStop the hypocrasy and stop using the environment and congestion as an excuse for the further abuse of the motorist.",
