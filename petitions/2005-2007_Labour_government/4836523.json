            "background": "Speed cameras are not perfectly accurate as some local authorities would like us to think. The publication of calibration certificates\nwould indicate for example if the were accurate to say +/- 3 mph. Every camera\ninstallation is unique and should be tested in situ with real motor vehicles\notherwise there can be no absolute certaintity that it is working correctly. Home office approval is no guarantee as toilets in prison cells also have to be approved. All electronic equipment is subject to errors caused by vibration,temperature etc. Doppler radar can be subject to all sorts odd reflections from vehicles travelling in the opposite direction as one example.",
