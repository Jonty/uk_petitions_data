            "background": "As a child of a retired-Gurkha serviceman I am being subjected to pay as an overseas student (i.e. around \u00a310,000 per year) as compared to \u00a33000 for the home student (as well as a student loan). Given the fact that Gurkha servicemen are genuinely underpaid as compared to their British counterparts, it should be noted that they can hardly afford to fund their children's education. For instance, a 4-yrs science undergraduate course would require a minimum fee of \u00a340,000. Moreover, this can only suffice to educate one child. \nThe current legislation states that one would qualify only if he/she has resided in the UK for at least 3 years or hails from one of the EU Nations.\n\nSo I would like to strongly plea to the Department for Education and Skills as well as the Home Office to recognise this matter and review the university fee-structure subjected upon the Gurkha children.\n\nEven though Gurkha servicemen and their families haven't been provided with a British citizenship as of yet or are as economically stable as their British counterparts, I believe education is one of the rights we should be allowed to access, in parallel with British citizens.",
