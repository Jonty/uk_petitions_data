Vice President of the Court of Appeal Criminal Division, said:\n\"It is more than a decade since the late Lord Taylor of Gosforth CJ called for a reduction in the torrent of legislation affecting criminal justice. Regrettably, that call has gone unheeded by successive governments. Indeed, the quantity of such legislation has increased and its quality has, if anything, diminished.\" Research carried out for the Legal Services Commission (Cape & Moorhead \u2018Costs Drivers in Criminal Defence Work\u2019) suggests that the primary cause of the Criminal Legal Aid budget running out of control is incompetent legislation. This government is addicted to passing laws for the sake of being seen to do something, rather than doing something which actually works.",
