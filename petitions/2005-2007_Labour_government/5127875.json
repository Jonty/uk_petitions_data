            "background": "Karate is one of the worlds most practised martial arts, and popularity for the sport is growing continually. The Olympics already hosts events in judo and tae kwon do, and it makes sense that a martial art with a universal following and understanding should also be recognised at an Olympic level.\n\nThere have been previous attempts to have karate recognised as an Olympic sport, all narrowly missing the required number of votes that would enable this to happen.\n\nAs karate is one of the united Kindoms most popular martial arts it would mean a lot to all the people who take part in the sport here for it to be seen in the London 2012 Games for the first time.",
