            "background": "In seeking to protect minority groups - such as the Gay Community - from discrimination, such legislation as the Sexual Orientation Regulations effectively criminalizes the majority Christian population. For example, teaching that marriage between heterosexual couples is God's plan, that the Bible teaches against homosexual practice, or the refusal of a Christian householder running a B&B to permit a homosexual couple the use of a double bed in accordance with their religious convictions would render such Christians liable to Court proceedings. They would therefore be discriminated against as the result of their Judeo-Christian faith (which has been the strength of our Country over the years). It is wrong to seek to prevent discrimination of one entity if another entity is going to be discriminated against in the process.",
