The Prime Minister is no longer believable and has dishonestly led our country to war.We are being taxed virtually out of existence:if you are aspirational you will pay tax for the privilege.  Crime,is out of control.  ID cards are a complete waste of money and we are becoming a police state.  Labour's liberalisation of this country has broken down the very fabric of society.  When they should be leading by example the government seems to be able to ride every scandal imaginable with impunity.  The Labour government can no longer blame past governments for the state of affairs in this country today when they have had 10 years to make the changes.In any business in the UK, they would have been fired from their jobs for incompetence and failure to deliver.   It is time for the people of the UK to stand up and be counted.We need a change now.",
