The internet and other technologies are mature enough to encourage and leverage unbiased debait and decision making.\n\nEmbracing the old with the new, principles of democracy with the accumulating innovations in social engineering. For example, PM TB's recently proposed new style of government would be incomplete without such plans, but the sparse and limited  provisions to date warrant these concerns. \n\nThe visible and power-distributing nature of such ventures would have many benefits, just a fraction being: further resistance against propaganda,  unwarranted nannying, less space for excuses, and better exposes of broken promises\n\nGoals regarding government organisation  given these technological changes should do more to sense and respond, encourage accountability and faster change, and ultimately more appropriate, wanted decisions!",
