The Research Councils most affected by this include the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council, which has been hit by a \u00a329 million reduction in funding, and the Medical Research Council, which is seeing a \u00a310.7 million reduction in funding. The response of the BBSRC biological research council announces that the council will have to cut 20 new grants and reduce expenditure on new equipment.",
