Unfortunately, the violent minority who pose a threat to society need to be tackled, and are done so on a routine basis by Police Officers. Tazers have been used in the United States with very few issues, they are less impactive than a baton strike or CS gas.  They are immediate in their incapacitation and may prevent more Police Officers losing their lives at the hands of knife using offenders.",
