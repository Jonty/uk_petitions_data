        "background": "Most people will agree that there are more and more people using mobile phones whilst driving.\n\nIt is proven driving whilst using a mobile phone distracts your attention  and also doesnt make you aware of the current situation and surroundings outside the car to respond quickly enough. \nThis means that using a mobile phone whislt driving is just as bad as being a drunk driver \n\nI with your help want the law to be changed to ban drivers caught using a mobile phone while driving because the increased fine and 3 points on the liscence is not working",
