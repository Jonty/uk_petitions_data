        "background": "Time and again I read stories in the paper about people who were denied life-saving treatments because the N.H.S. refused to pay for them; these stories always seem to end by saying that the individual concerned has sold, or re-mortgaged, his/her house to pay for the treatment needed.  It is obviously appalling that anyone should have to do this; but I, as a Council tenant who has never even been able to CONTEMPLATE buying accommodation, am very concerned about what would happen to me (and, of course, to anyone else in the same situation) if I were denied any treatment which would save my life.  Would I just have to die??!!",
