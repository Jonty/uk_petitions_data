        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "So far, Local Education Authorities can provide no support to students who wish to train in Circus schools, although funding is available for performing arts and universities.  This leaves those who wish to train for Circus performance relying on family or bank loans to support them.  Circus schools are currently charging fees in the region of \u00a36K per year and students need to provide their own living costs while not being able to work because of the demands of the courses (up to 10 hours per day, 5 days per week).  The lack of support seems unfair compared with that offered to university students and performing arts students.",
