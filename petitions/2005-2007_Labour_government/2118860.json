            "background": "MFL teaching reflects the principle that exposure to unfamiliar language stimulates students\u2019 interpretive and inferential skills but we\u2019ve stopped regarding English in the same way.The ability to hold language in the mind, from absorbing the shortest simplest story, to developing the ability to navigate the structure of a sustained narrative, is one that is generated only through hearing and absorbing spoken language.Children denied familiarity with the richness of the English language will inevitably become disenfranchised, barred from participating in their communities in a truly influential way, and without the means and choice ever to leave them.  We need to give children, through education, the language to challenge and to change this country\u2019s institutions and practices.Children from diverse cultural backgrounds must continue to grow up to challenge and reform our national institutions if we wish those institutions to reflect our society as an inclusive and equitable one.",
