It was my dream as a child to care for these magnificent creatures but at the age of twelve I find that nobody takes me seriously. We would like to make it legal to import african/indian elephants from africa/india to sell in pet shops across the UK. Elephants  are creatures that children could learn about better by owning their own and keeping them in easily and cheaply converted sheds. Please take my idea into account.\nJack Smithies",
