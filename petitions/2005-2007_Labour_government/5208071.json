            "background": "This country is soft on criminals, yet hard on the hardworking honest taxpayer. English families wait for years on council lists for a home yet immigrants get one handed to them when they arrive. Billions are spent on wars yet the NHS is a lost cause. Global warming is a natural occurance and has nothing to do with what we do. Yet this is a billion dollar business so dont expect anyone to say they got it wrong, not whilst they can tax you on it!\nWhilst the news is always stating how many immigrants come to this country every year, why dont they talk about how many UK citizins opt out and leave their country for good. If you looked at the figures i think you'd be surprised and you have to ask yourself, can you blame them?",
