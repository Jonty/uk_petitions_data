        "background": "Don\u2019t get me wrong i want our country to be known for what it has achieved and i know that the Olympics will make us well known but we are also becoming well know for the awful condition our NHS services are in. people are dying and yet cuts are still being made when is the time going to come when people will start to realise that the money we pay every month for our services is being wasted on fads and glamorous ventures, if a nursing student like me can notice the poor condition the NHS is in why cant the people who can make a difference see it to. Why should we our health have to suffer when we work so hard in life and pay our way because the government would rather spend billions on a stadium rather than buy new equipement and employe more staff.",
