Whichever it is they have almost certainly not earned their assets. So as the country has been so good to them why should they not give something back to it. They could be given an advisor who would assess how much work they were actually doing - and the amount of community service varied - between 1 week for those employed full time - to longer periods for the completely idle rich. Pensioners obviously excluded.",
