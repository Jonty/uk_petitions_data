            "background": "This removes the need for congestion charging as it encourages less journies, public transport, shared cars and localised economies. A massive tax increase on aviation fuel is also required, and will have a knock on effect of reducing the number of travellers, making asylum visits and international terrorist training trips more expensive for the travller and hence easier / cheaper for governemnt agencies to filter.\n\nOil is a limited resources - it's taxation should reflect that fact. Directly increasing the cost of petrol is better than implementing artfices such a toll roads and congestion charging.",
