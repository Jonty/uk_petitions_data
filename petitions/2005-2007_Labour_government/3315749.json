        "background": "Make the DAISY international standard for Digital Talking Books (DTB) a standard output for all UK student material. This would offer all UK students, including those with disabilities, considerably more functionality than traditional text books or e-books, provide all course material in synchronised text to MP3 audio format, and aid their learning through synchronised accelerated multi-sensory learning systems. It would also mean that all UK educational establishments would automatically comply with the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) and Special Educational Needs and Disability Act (SENDA) legislation.",
