        "background": "The primary care trust are taking advantage of our older citizens, taking what money they have left for there retirement to pay for treatment for age related condition wet mascula disease. The p.c.t. will not fund this treatment therefore leaving pensioners to go blind or spend life savings trying to save their sight. They risk being put in care homes when eventually losing thier sight which can happen in as little as 3mths without treatment. Our pensioners have paid their stamp, some for over 40 yrs. Imagine losing your sight in one eye knowing you will lose the sight in the other very soon, your 80 and very scared. unless you are prepared to spend 8 -10,000 pounds for treatment, you will be living in a care home very shortly. your independance and self respect have just been stolen.....",
