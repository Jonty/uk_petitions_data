            "background": "As a disabled person using direct payments and the Independent Living Fund, I pay a care agency to provide personal care as employing PAs yourself is a nightmare. The two ladies who help me now are wonderful, but in the past, I've had people sent by these agencies who \"don't care\", have bad attitudes,  poor English  and racist attitudes towards white British people Some agencies have office staff with no concept of what personal care is, so think its ok to suddenly withdraw it. A small minority are rude and have no telephone manners. As many disabled people won't / can't complain, and huge amounts of tax payer's money are keeping these agencies going, can we not have a government run care employment agency instead? That way, the standards of each employee's work and English could be monitored without profit being a major consideration.",
