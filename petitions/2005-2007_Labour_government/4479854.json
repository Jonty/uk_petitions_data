            "background": "the current calculation process for road tax on LPG converted cars only considers the original C02 emissions from when the vehicle was registered as found on the V5 log book. The calculation takes no consideration of the substantially reduced emissions once the LPG conversion has been completed. People are trying to be environmentally friendlier in their approach to road travel and the government gives no encouragement to this cause.",
