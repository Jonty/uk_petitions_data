        "background": "To provide a cross section of individuals to review the new laws proposed by the House of Commons, the Lords should be replaced by individuals chosen at random in the same manner as  juriors, and only in exceptional circumstances should those chosen be able to refuse. It should be viewed as a responsibility of being a British Citizen to be balanced against a Citizens rights. They should serve for 3 to 5 years and receive the same pay and expenses as an MP, although the number could be reduced by 25% to 50%. They should not be elected as they cannot change laws, only review and recommend changes to legislation, the elected Commons still must have final executive powers.",
