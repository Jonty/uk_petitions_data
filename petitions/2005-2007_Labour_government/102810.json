            "background": "I am very concerned about the mobile phone base station on the roof of Clevedon Community School, North Somerset.  This was sited in agreement with the previous Headteacher in 1997 in return for repairing the school roof. The school would have to pay K100,000 to the mobile phone giant, 'Orange' in order to get out of their contract.\nThere is now scientific evidence which suggests there may be biological effects occurring at exposures to RF radiation below NRPB and ICNIRP guidelines.  IEGMP considered that children might be more vulnerable because of their developing nervous systems and the greater absorption of radiation by their tissues. Reported symptoms of RF exposure include dizziness, fatigue, chronic headache, irregular heart beat, nausea and vertigo, and loss of memory and concentration.  There may be serious long-term risks to exposure to RF fields. T-Mobile are also applying to site another base station next to the school. Please help us to get rid of these base stations!",
