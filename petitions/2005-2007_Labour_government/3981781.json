The aim- \u201done contract per customer, one box per vehicle.\u201d \n4/ The EU itself, not just our government, reserves the right to impose road pricing on us!  \n\nThe EU is serious \u2013 it has also funded the RCI project which demonstrates the interoperability of Road Charging between 6 EU countries.  As part of the project it will show how any road charging transaction in Europe could be carried out with a single set of in-vehicle equipment. \n \nWe need to know the truth, as to exactly how the government is going roll this one out and how it will affect all of us!",
