        "background": "Lord Anton of Moxey is a minor celebrity in the old ramshackled seaside town of Exmouth. \n\nFor years he has been bullying and ridiculing people for no apparent reason other than to swell the size of his own head.\n\nDespite this and even during his six minute spell as a homeless person Exewebbers still find it within themselves to feel sorry for him. Not even driving round in a ridicolous orange car can stop halt the growth of his cult following. \n\nFor years he has preached about order so now I believ the time has come for him to be appointed a moderator so we can see if he is all mouth and no armani trousers.",
