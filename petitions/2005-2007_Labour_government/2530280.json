            "background": "People do not wish to create any greater harm to our environment than is absolutely necessary. Transport is one of the principal areas of impact, which may be affected by change and this work should begin now. The iniquitous fragmentation of our systems and their exorbitantly high cost is far more than we can afford. Entirely new strategies combining lowest environmental impact with the highest levels of functionality and social acceptance must be developed urgently if we are to move ahead into a more civilised and sustainable future. The initiative must come from the top of government and draw on the best of our academic, scientific and engineering minds working to engage our whole society in finding the best solutions for sustainable, effective transport for the future.",
