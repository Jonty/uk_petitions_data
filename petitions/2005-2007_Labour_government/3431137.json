            "background": "If it's that crucial that we have make-up, humans should take the risk in testing if we want to look good. After all it's not the animals that it's going to benefit is it! \nMany small animals die in favour of us looking and feeling our best. They are our problems NOT ANIMALS'!\nVets don't test animal vaccines on us do they? No! So why should animals have to put up with this?\nRabbits can't talk can they? What would they be saying if they could? Just imagine it screaming as it's burnt with a chemical used for human eyes as eyeliner. Is this natural!?!?\nHow can people be worried about Global Warming and Endangered Animals if we are killing the animals that we can love as pets. Would you put mascara on your pet hampster? \n\nI wouldn't.\n\nPlease sign this petition if you feel how I feel.",
