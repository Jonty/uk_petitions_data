            "background": "I think that Prison Officers should be provided with Stab / Bullet proof vests for when they are on Duty. At present Prison Officers have no Personal Protective Equipment and are surrounded by a 100% Criminal element, ranging from Burglars to Mass Murderers.\n\nThe Police are surrounded by about 4% of the criminal element at any one time, and they have anti stab / bullet proof vests, I think that Prison Officers should get the same standard of equipment Police Officers as Prison Officers do a dangerous, demanding and tough job.",
