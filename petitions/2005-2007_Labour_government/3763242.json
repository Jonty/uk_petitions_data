            "background": "In the Department of Trade and Industry's code of practice on\nprice indications, it says that shops can only advertise a\nproduct as being discounted if it has been priced at the higher rate for 28 days. However.......with fruit and veg, the publicised discount only relates to the\nlast advertised price.\n\nThis means supermarkets can hike the price up of Fruit and Veg\none week and decrease it the next. They can then advertise the\nproduct at being reduced in price. \n\nSome supermarkets even\nadvertise that the price has been decreased by upto 50% (Or more) but in\nfact if you take the average price over the last 28 days it\nhasn't been reduced at all.I believe this is very misleading to\nshoppers!!!\n\nLegislation should be brought in to close this loophole.",
