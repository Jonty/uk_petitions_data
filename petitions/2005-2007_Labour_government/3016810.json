        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This would be a much fairer\nsystem than the current suggestion of road pricing.  Every driver would have a personal petrol allowance (eg 1500 gallons, approximately 5000 miles) with which they would buy petrol at a certain rate. Once over that amount, petrol costs would rise sharply. This would encourage people to think about whether a car journey is actually necessary, whilst at the same time taking into account that some driving is unavoidable.  This seems a better way of reducing pollution. If you use your car sensibly you will not be penalised~however, if you choose to drive over your allowance, you will pay a higher rate for the privilege. This would also encourage people to make their next car purchase a more economical alternative.  \nI would propose that each person is\ngiven a card that has to be swiped when purchasing petrol as a means of keeping track of how much has been used (thus alleviating the need for expensive and intrusive tracking devices).",
