            "background": "There is a massive health inequality between men and women in the NHS and I propose that more money should be spent on male specific health issues, so that male related NHS funding is brought into line with female related NHS funding. Men in the UK have a far lower life expectancy than women and the funding provided for women specific health issues are many times the funding received for male specific problems, for example there is national screening for breast cancer, cervical cancer there is none for testicular, prostate or bowel cancer even though it could save thousands of lives. Men have also a higher rate of heart disease then women, however there is less spent on prevention of heart disease.  This apparent Funding differential between men and women is only a political decision because women are more likely to vote on health issues. This is a petition of equal rights and equal funding for men on the NHS.",
