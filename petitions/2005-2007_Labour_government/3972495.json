No matter what our creed, Colour or Background, Everyone should want to wave the George Cross and shout to the world \"Look at me, I'm English\"  In order for the people of this great Nation to embrace their country, we would request that Mr Blair/Brown declare a National Holiday in England to Celebrate in style.  We are the only country in the United Kingdon that Doesn't celebrate their Patron Saint.  It's not racist to be English or to wave the flag of your country, it should be a thing of pride!",
