        "background": "Did you know that many of the immigrants arriving in Britain speak little or no English?\n\nThis means that work is almost impossible for them, forcing them to live off of the countries benefits.  Think of the money that these benefits cost us in taxes!  It's unthinkable!\n\nIn Australia and Canada they have a system that all immigrants to their country must pass the IELTS (International English Language Testing System) before being allowed into their country.  This does not happen in Britain.\n\nSign this petition to help make immigrants speak our language!!!\n\nThank You.",
