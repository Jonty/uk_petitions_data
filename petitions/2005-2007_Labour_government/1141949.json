We support the right for homosexual couples to be protected from persecution and discrimination. However, we urge the government to also respect the religious views of adoption agencies and of parents giving their children for adoption; and allow them to specify criteria for adoption according to the dictates of their conscience. We believe church adoption agencies provide a vital service that should be allowed to continue without hinderance. We declare that expressing a preferance that children be placed in homes where there is a mother and a father is not discrimination.",
