            "background": "The benefits currently available provide no incentive to discourage the long term unemployed from seeking employment. From an economic viewpoint many people see themselves better off if they remain on Job Seekers allowance - resulting in a significant proportion of the working population failing to contribute to the running of the country, therefore punishing those who seek employment. Child Tax Credits, free council housing  and more significantly Child Benefits encourage teenage pregnancies further to the voluntary unemployment levels - resulting in our being the country with the highest rate of teenage pregnancy. All at significant cost to the honest, hardworking taxpayer.",
