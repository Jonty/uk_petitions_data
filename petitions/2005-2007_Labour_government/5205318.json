            "background": "Following the attacks of 9/11 the United States government removed private security firms from critical areas of airport security such as passenger and baggage screening, ramp and aircraft security. Following allegations made by ITV's 'Tonight' programme in relation to poor security standards at Birmingham airport, it is clear that passengers are being put at risk and deserve a more efficient and less corruptable system of protection. This petition requests that an end be put to the outsourcing of airport security to private companies and the formation and deployment of a new government managed and operated organisation to execute all security duties at UK airports in the future.",
