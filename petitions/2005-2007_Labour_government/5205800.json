        "background": "We are sick and tired of people not understanding basic principles of London Underground, and on a wider scale, Public Transport, etiquette. We believe that a Proficiency Test on the London Underground is the first of many steps required to ensure that efficiency is introduced on all public transport systems of the country. For too long novices (and tourists) of public transport systems hold up the experienced and the rushed, and, much like the cycling proficieny tests at junior school, a training system MUST be made compulsory.",
