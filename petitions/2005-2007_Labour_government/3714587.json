As it is there are far too many motorists who fail to put there lights on in reduced visibility (bad rain, fog, etc...).  If someone cannot do that, what chance do we have of seeing their silhouette as they drive \"out of the sun\".  With a bright light such as the sun behind you, you are m,uch more likely to be seen if you lights are on.\n\nTherefore, I propose it be made mandatory, as are seatbelts.",
