Instead of creating another raft of, control, cost tax and big business, this lightweight technology could be made open to the public (at no cost) and supported by a very small cost to the taxpayer, and buld by the uers on  a 'free to access' basis. The benefit of this would be to make the UK a truly mobile and connected nation like no other. Creating this public network would be the same as the Victorians bulding roads sewers or libraries for the public benefit for the simple reason is that the Country needs it beyond self interest.",
