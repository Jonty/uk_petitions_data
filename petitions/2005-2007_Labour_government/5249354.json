        "background": "I believe it is every child's right to live unmolested by sexual predators. Voluntary chemical castration doesn't go far enough. The men who commit these offences belive children are sexually active and fully consent to their advances. Repeat offenders are the norm and there is no 'cure'.\n\nMen convicted of more than one sexual crime against children should be forcibly chemically castrated.\n\nThe children's human rights are not taken into account by the abusive man, therefore that man waives his own human rights by choosing to act in this way.",
