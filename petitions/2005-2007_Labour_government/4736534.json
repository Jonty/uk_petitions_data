            "background": "In recent years much has been made of the pensions crisis.\n\nSaving for retirement is just one of the many investments we are encouraged to make during the course of our lifetime.\n\nWhen making any kind of investment, the warning that the value may go down as well as up is displayed.\n\nNever a warning that your hard earned money will be ravaged by a cash-strapped government and that you, who had scrimped and saved for 40+ years, will receive nothing but excuses in return.\n\nIf this government were as dedicated to resolving the pensions crisis as they claim, then surely the first step will be to eliminate tax on pensions ?\n\nMy petition to this government is to address this issue by decisive and positive action, not by increased levels of stealth tax and moral maneuvering.\n\nIn short, I believe if the government books were properly balanced, more public money being spent on public services than administration, then maybe we could get a handle on issues such as pensions and the health service.",
