        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Why should council tax paying people who have no children at primary school (ie pensioners) pay for other peoples children to have free school meals when their parents are working and can afford it? We already pay tax on our wages, council tax for services and now extra council tax so other peoples kids can eat? Either scrap it or give people without primary school kids a discount. This is a really unfair system and will be shown so at the next election. Now that is an election promise that will come true !!",
