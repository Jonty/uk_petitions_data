This goes against fairness for all and allow BT direct access to your bank account. Companies should not be allowed to dictate the method of payment that suits them & penalise you if you pay by a different method. It is noted also that this type of discrimination has been made illegal in Eire. This practice should not be allowed to continue here.",
