        "background": "British Telecom have introduced a penalty charge to all customers for not using the Direct Debit system. This goes against fairness for all and allow BT direct access to your bank account. Companies should not be allowed to dictate the method of payment that suits them & penalise you if you pay by a different method. It is noted also that this type of discrimination has been made illegal in Eire. This practice should not be allowed to continue here.",
