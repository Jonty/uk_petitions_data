The government should ensure all manufacturers and retails use recycleable materials so that the householders task is simpler. Then, if a householder does not adapt then come down on them. Household rubbish is only about 10% of the problem with landfill yet the householder is being'soft targeted'. How much more can the public's pocket be rifled?",
