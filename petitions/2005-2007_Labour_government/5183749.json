            "background": "before creating more stealth taxes under the guise of protecting the enviroment wouldn't it be more productive and forward thinking to invest in the ability to recycle everything we use. The government should ensure all manufacturers and retails use recycleable materials so that the householders task is simpler. Then, if a householder does not adapt then come down on them. Household rubbish is only about 10% of the problem with landfill yet the householder is being'soft targeted'. How much more can the public's pocket be rifled?",
