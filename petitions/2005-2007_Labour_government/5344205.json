            "background": "As a direct result of the increased speed of jet aircraft over their propeller predecessors, the jet-age brought phenomena such as shuttle diplomacy and regular diplomatic tours.  To this day, there is no aircraft to have ever entered full civilian service to have come close to matching the speed of Concorde, and no greater use for this remarkable aircraft than as an executive flight.  Concorde possesses both the speed necessary for the greatest productivity from government ministers and the prestige for both ministerial and royal tours that only it could afford.  As an international symbol of high engineering, ingenuity and design, Concorde was voted in 2006 the greatest British design since 1900 in a contest run by the Design Museum and the BBC.  With the vast majority of the costs already sunk by the British government, including its billion-pound development costs, a modern-fitted Concorde could be produced for an amount comparable to that of a medium-sized subsonic aircraft.",
