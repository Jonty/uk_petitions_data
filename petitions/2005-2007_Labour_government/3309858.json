        "background": "As a young 18 year old I was unable to further my education because of financial circumstances. As my father earns 40k a year that means that I do not qualify for the EMA scheme (you need to earn less than 30k). Although he earns over 40k per year that does not mean he can also afford to pay my travel fees to and from college which would work out at around \u00a350 per week which would exclude college fees and extras. This has forced me to go into employment full time rather than furthering my education. Every student deserves the same opportunuites not just those who come from a less privileged background.",
