            "background": "The current Tax Credit system is overloaded, poorly resourced and funded, Staff are overstretched and poorly trained. As a result they are unable to deal with the volume of work, are making serious errors and delays, which is causing significant hardship and distress to innocent people who are the most vulnerable and in need of these very Credits. In theory an appeal can be made to the Parliamentary Ombudsman, however nearly all of these are being rejected as she is too busy and overwhealmed. Cases are being referred back to HMR&C, the very people who made the mistakes and who caused the problems. This makes HMR&C effectively 'Judge, Jury and Executioner' without any effective oversight or protection for citizens.",
