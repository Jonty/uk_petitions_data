            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Rather than create a tax which will only benefit the treasury, we urge the government to force the airlines to offset their carbon usage on a per flight basis, using one or more of the carbon offsetting schemes now available. \n\nIf the airlines were forced to offset their carbon then the cost of doing so would be added to the fare, but it would mean that all flights, even the relatively empty ones, would have a zero carbon footprint.\n\nCarbon offsetting would provide a clear and transparent mechanism for reducing greenhouse gases, in which it could be demonstrated that the extra money being paid for fares was being put directly to use in tackling global warming, in direct proportion to the actual fuel being burnt. \n\nIt could also be shown that the populations of poorer parts of the world were benefiting directly from the offsetting schemes, thus benefiting the global fight against poverty as well as the environment.\n\nContrast this with a green tax for air travel which would disappear into the treasury and could not be shown to benefit the environment or the fight against poverty directly.",
