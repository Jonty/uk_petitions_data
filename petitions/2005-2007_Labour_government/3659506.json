I cannot see why the government have to take our money, mess around with it for a little and recycle it back to us through the expensive and error strewn tax credit system. \n\nIt doesn't add any value, just adds concern to the low income families it is meant to benefit through a fear in an incorrect reward.\n\nScrap tax credits that hardly anyone understands, and implement a greater tax free allowance according to how many children you have.",
