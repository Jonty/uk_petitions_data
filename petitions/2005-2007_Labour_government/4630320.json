            "background": "The abortion act 1967, along with guidelines from the RCOG, allow doctors to opt out of referring patients for and performing abortions for reasons of conscience. \n\nFurthermore modernisation of medical training has led to a situation where doctors are able to opt out of particular areas of training within their chosen field.\n\nAs a result of this, the number of doctors training in and offering these services has dwindled to the point where provision of abortions is now threatened.",
