            "background": "Many UK firms move mid-range job functions overseas (for example, call centres and accounting functions) as well as making major asset acquisitions that benefit other economies, though not primarily ours - BA buying Boeing is the latest example. Firms that wish to trade in the UK should be encouraged to maintain the greater part of their operations and use their buying power in the UK. This to promote a wider range of UK job opportunities, for all age groups, which will then offer a wider range for choice of career, more avenues for progression and a more solid foundation for the future of our economy and our children.",
