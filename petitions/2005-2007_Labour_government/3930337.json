            "background": "The NHS currently pays for services that do not directly save someone's life or have a definate impact on their everyday lives; for example by paying for rounds of fertility treatment at the same time as many children are waiting to be adopted.  The money that would be saved could be used to pay for services necessary to enable a reasonable standard of living. People who wear glasses, for example, have to pay large sums each year; but would be unable to function without their specs.",
