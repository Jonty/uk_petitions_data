        "background": "We Request that any material showing nudity or crude sexual images of women or men, be taken out of public view. Either by setting aside a specific private area for them, or by covering the images up prior to sale. This should include all newspapers be it Broadsheet or Tabloids or any magazines. Many Families want to walk into a shop and not be faced with pictures of bottoms, breasts or Bikini Clad females etc and many find it very offensive. Many people that work in shops that sell such items, find it upsetting having to serve this type of material along with other goods. yet they need their job and are frightened to voice out. If a person was to walk down the street or knock on your door with the fashion these adverts and images show, it is likely that they would be arrested for indecent exposure. Yet everyday thousands have to suffer the discomfort of having such material forced in their faces.",
