Sids unique grasp of the english language coupled with his off beat historical references has made his voice and his comments an incredible addition to television armchair sports watching. There are many in this slightly left field position, Stuart Hall, John Gwynne, Dave Lanning. All of them artists in their chosen arena, wordsmiths that have brought humour and fun to their commentary. Sid is a special talent and this country needs to recognise this.",
