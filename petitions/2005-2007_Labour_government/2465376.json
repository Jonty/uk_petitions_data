        "background": "Local authorities are not equipped to deal with this serious issue and voluntary recycling will always be inefficient.  Daft schemes like weighing rubbish on the doorstep is labour intensive and reducing collections will cause conflict. All rubbish should be separated and recycled in purposely built centres around the country. These types of centres exist in Germany and can recycle absolutely all waste from rubble to rubber. To pay for these centres all products and packaging should be rated for recyclability and a recycle sales tax applied on that rating. This will encourage manufacturers to think carefully about their packaging so that they remain competitively priced. This scheme, if implemented, would mean that we will produce less waste and recycle all of it.",
