            "background": "It is in the interests of all concerned that the production and distribution of cannabis is regulated. Firstly in terms of who is able to purchase ie 18 and over. Also that what they purchase is \"safe\" and is not doctored. A free market that is taxed and regulated is a responsible market as free market forces ensure rogue suppliers go out of business. In an illegal black market these forces are intangible. Taxes are non existent and supplies to those who are res sua (of capacity to choose ie 18) would be ensured as the supplier would have the threat of losing their licence.\nwe are asking that the home secretary allows the licensing of coffeshops to grow and sell cannabis in a responsible way. the law can only be allowed to stand if effective and proportionate. rapists are given less time than pot dealers if they get anything at all and clearly the legislation is ineffective as cannabis is available everywhere. QED",
