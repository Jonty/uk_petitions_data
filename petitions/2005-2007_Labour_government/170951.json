            "background": "LPG and other Green powered Vehicles emit significantly lower emmissions when compared with a petrol powered vehicle. The current Road tax system allows for newer green cars to be Road Tax exempt but older LPG converted cars are not included in this scheme. \n If the government really are interested in decreacing emmisions from transportation then it should encourage the public to spend the money on the LPG conversion for thier car and as a reward make them Road Tax exempt.",
