Members of parliament to serve for a maximum of five years, with exemption only in exceptional circumstances. The civil service reformed to service parliament, e.g. in educating representatives on policies and procedures. \nRepresentation is a poor form of democracy. Evidently we can't all participate efficiently in the the everyday functions of government, but a cross section of society in both the 'Lords' and the 'Commons' would do a much better job than self-serving professionals.",
