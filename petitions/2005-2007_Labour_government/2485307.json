            "background": "Severalls Mental Hospital, opened in 1913, was built to care for approximately 2,000 people from parts of East Anglia.\nBuilt in the \"Arts & Crafts\" style, and laid out in the \"Echelon\" plan, this Edwardian Hospital sucessfully cared for it's residents until it closed in 1997. Now lying derelict & due to lack of proper security, has suffered from vandalism, arson & general neglect. The Main Hall was totally destroyed in 1995, and the Administration Building (Grade 2 listed) has been damaged by fire too. Set in many acres of mature gardens & woodland, the buildings & land now face a new threat -major redevelopment, involving the loss of most of the original buildings, and large chunks of the surrounding land.\nIt is my hope that the Developers & the Planning Dept. will reconsider the proposals, and revise to keep much more of the historically & socially important original buildings, which with a bit of thought, could be converted & reused (much better for the environment!)\nThank you.",
