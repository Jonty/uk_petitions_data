There are too many access and egress locations which combine to create dangerous risks of\nserious accidents, when almost all\nheavy goods vehicles are being driven\nin excess of the legal 50 mph limit.\nAt motorway speed limits on this very\ncongested road the drivers of HGVs are\nputting the lives of all other A14\nusers at risk.    Experience has shown\nthat this road is possibly the most\ndangerous in this country.",
