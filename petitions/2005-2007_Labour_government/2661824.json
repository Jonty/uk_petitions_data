            "background": "The UK's passive adherance to and support of US foreign policy has weakened the UK on the world stage and having once been respected as a fair though sometimes critical friend of most nations is now vilified as a puppet of the US and in particular GW Bush.  In view of the fact that US foreign policy is misguided to the point of illegality and insanity, I contend that the UK should no longer align itself blindly to the US but rather should develop original thought and action in respect of world events, including those in Iraq.",
