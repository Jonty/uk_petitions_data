            "background": "I am working as a doctor in this country and am fast seeing that this work holds no value with the current government anyway - but at least my cultural identity and background should be safeguarded in the country of my birth.  I am disgusted that on national television such racist behaviour is allowed to go unchecked. An Indian filmstar is subjected to racist comments and backbiting on 24 hour filmed television which is utterly abhorrent while the UK government does nothing.  Additionally - I think it is pathetic (and ridiculously unbelievable) that the PM states that he has not seen the Celebrity Big Brother in question - I think he should make it his priority especially that many of the Asian community are expressing such deep resentment of the racism that is displayed.  I am ashamed to live and work here.",
