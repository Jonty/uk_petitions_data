            "background": "Following New Labour passing the Scotland Act, by which the Scottish Parliament was set up in 1999, many central areas of governmental responsibility in Scotland (such as Education and Health) are now properly within the competance of the Scottish Parliament.  The MPs elected for Scottish constituencies who sit at Westminster cannot influence the decisions of the Scottish Parliament and they should certainly not be voting on English matters.  Accordingly as at least half of the work of the Scottish MPs in Westminster has now been taken away, so it is appropriate that their Parliamentary salary be reduced proportionatly.",
