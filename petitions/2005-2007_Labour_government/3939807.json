            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Energy-efficiency is to be encouraged, but a ban on incandescent bulbs is utterly disproportionate. Incandescent (conventional/tungsten) bulbs emit a homely and aesthetically-pleasing quality of light. Their light has a continuous spectrum which renders the colours of people, artefacts and home-decor vividly and naturally.\nWhile incandescent bulbs are inefficient, they are simple and practical. Compact-fluorescent lamps (CFLs) are NOT universal substitutes, taking time to reach full brightness and performing poorly in attics and outbuildings subject to low and/or cyclic temperatures. Further, the spectrum of light from CFLs is spikey, discontinuous and unnatural, preventing them from rendering colours accurately. Consequently, rooms lit by CFLs appear grey, clinical, and lifeless. CFLs are wholly unsuitable for artists and photographers. It is also impractical to produce alternatives for all special-purpose filament bulbs in use today.\nEnvironmental policy should focus on reducing space-heating and transport, which consume 50-100 times more energy than banning bulbs will ever save.",
