            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "This petition has been created in light of the recent budget that took place on 22nd March 2006 which stated that small PLG cars will be road tax free. \n\nAs all quad bike riders are aware, their road legal quad bikes are classed as a car and as you well know are also small! In fact there is no other PLG vehicle that is smaller than a quad bike, so why are road legal quad bikes NOT receiving free road tax as promised by the Chancellor? \n\nThe Chancellor made the following announcement regarding Vehicle Excise Duty (VED): \n\nCars registered on or after 1st March 2001 which fall into Band A (CO2 emissions up to 100 g/km) will attract a nil rate of duty. \n\nThe important factor to take note of is that: \n\n1. A Quad bike is registered as a car/PLG. \n\n2. All quad bikes fall below the CO2 emissions of up to 100g/km thus resulting in a nil rate of duty. \n\nSo, why are road legal quad bike owners still being charged \u00a3110 to tax their vehicles, this needs sorting out immediately.",
