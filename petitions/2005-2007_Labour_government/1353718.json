            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We have many old laws, including the Magna Carta, that are technically still law. I propose that a cut-off date is established, say 1900, cancelling laws made before this date. Laws that are still required should be put forward as new laws. Finally, all new laws should be given a 'sell-by date' or at least a stated time when the law has to be reviewed or ratified in the future. This proposal is not something that can be done overnight, but a committee process to address this issue should be commissioned. Old laws are both dangerous and stupid - some people use old laws and charters in unpleasant or inappropriate ways whilst other laws are ineffective or of little relevance. Examples: The Magna Carta was not respected when the Poll Tax was introduced; the fellow who jumped into the pulpit at Canterbury Cathedral a while ago was fined a paltry sum because the action had an old law specifically for that crime. Old charters and deeds are also an issue that such a committee should look at.",
