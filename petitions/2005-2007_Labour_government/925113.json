            "background": "To abolish the imposition of the new air traveler 'environmental charge' to be introduced by Gordon Brown from 1st February 2007. Everyone knows this is just a stealth tax on air transport under the guise of an environmental charge. It is ill thought out and has created confusion and disruption not only to airlines but to millions of air travelers. It particularly the air tax affects travellers from the Channel Islands, Isle of Man and Scottish Islands who usually have to make two flights (one in to the UK mainland and one out)so will have to pay the tax twice. Residents and business travelers to these Crown dependancies already suffer from inordinately high air fares, and other than slow sea travel have no other means of traveling away from their island homes. They are being unreasonably peanalised for being domiciled off-shore, 99% of whom are not tax exiles but regular citizens struggling to make ends meet.",
