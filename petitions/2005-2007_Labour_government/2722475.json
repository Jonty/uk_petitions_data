            "background": "In towns and cities throughout the country, special lanes and paths have been built, at tax payers' expense, to ensure the safety of cyclists and to ease the congestion they cause. The majority of cyclists still use the roads which, in most cases, causes traffic to queue behind them waiting for an opportunity to pass them safely. \n\nCyclists are a very vocal minority and are constantly petitioning local and national government for special privileges, but when they are granted, still don't take advantage of them. If it were made an offence for cyclists to use a road where special arrangements have been made to accommodate them, they would appreciate their own obligations toward legitimate road users, and traffic will certainly flow more freely.",
