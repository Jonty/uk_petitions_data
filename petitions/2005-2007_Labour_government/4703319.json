There are now too many childminders and not enough children to fill the spaces. I work 50 hours a week and only earn \u00a3140 per week before all my work related expenses are paid. I would like the goverment to top up our wages when we have empty spaces, otherwise many of us will give up the career in favour of better paid jobs with less hours, equating to a shortage of childcare in the future. We are enticed into this career by being told it is highly paid, then when we qualify it is completly different.",
