            "background": "MPs at present pay neither income tax nor national insurance.  This makes them immune to changes in income tax or national insurance (except in broad terms - the expression of voters' disapproval at the next election).  Consequently there is a perception that when it comes to passing new legislation, or levying addition taxes (in whatever form) MPs give little thought to the circumstances of the general public, from whom taxes are levied to pay (amongst others) MPs. If a considerable portion of an MPs salary were to be deducted each month by way of taxes, this would remind them to consider those to whom they have pledged their support - the ordinary voter.  I would further suggest that they not be allowed the exemption of being classed as \"self-employed,\" which would permit far too much fiscal manipulation to offset supposed costs of business (secretary - often the MP's wife, accommodation in London, travel, etc.) which ordinary voters mnust take into account when deciding the attractiveness of their own salary package.",
