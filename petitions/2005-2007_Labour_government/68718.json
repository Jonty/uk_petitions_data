            "background": "Numerous accidents occur, many very serious, when left-hand drive lorries overtake on British motorways and collide with unsuspecting drivers. These accidents happen because the drivers are not able to see into the lane that they are moving into due to a blind spot in their mirror vision.\n\nLegislation is coming in at the end of the year that will make it compulsory for all brand new left-hand drive lorries to have anti-blind spot mirrors fitted, however there are thousands of existing left hand lorries on our roads right now that should also have to comply to these simple measures. Only after these vital changes have been implemented will we have safer roads.",
