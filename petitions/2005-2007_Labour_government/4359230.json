            "background": "Were speed limiters to be bought in, imagine a motorcycle overtaking a long lorry, halfway past a speed limiter prevents the motorcycle accelerating further. That leaves the motorcycle exposed to danger for a longer period than it would otherwise be. Throttle control by the rider is a greater part of riding safely than driving a car, cut the power in a bend and a rider could fall off.\nI therefore urge the Prime Minister to scrap the whole idea of fitting speed limiters to motorcycles.",
