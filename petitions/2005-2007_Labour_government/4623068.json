            "background": "A magnificent and poignant bronze sculpture by James Napier, a gifted young British artist, reflects the deplorable state of post service support given those who have served our country in combat zones. A substantial proportion of those with no proper home who live on the streets, are ex-servicemen unable to cope when returning to civilian life after experiencing the horrors of action. Yet the  Government and MOD, have callously fallen short in responding to the needs of so many who have suffered physically and mentally, in serving our nation in combat. Hence, this sculpture has been titled \u201cThe Abandoned Soldier\u201d, and its impact says more than mere words! \n\nI urge you to support this petition to have this moving work erected permanently on the \u201cvacant\u201d plinth in Trafalgar Square to honour and remind us all of those who have given so much in the service of our country. This has nothing to do with whether you support any, all, or none of the actions to which our servicemen have been assigned \u2013 it is to recognise their fulfilment of their \u201cDUTY\u201d, and the \u201cDUTY\u201d we all have to ensure that they are properly and sympathetically looked after when they need our help.",
