Since it is our children who will support all of us when we are older, if they create a surplus for us all, and they are inclined to agree policies to support us, those people who have successfully supported and developed their children should benefit.\nThose people who do not support and encourage their children should have a reduced pension, and those who did not have children should benefit from investing the money they did not spend on children (including money the state invests in children from their tax contribution).\n\nIn this way, responsible parenthood would be encouraged. \nThe link could be a percentage of tax paid by the children, or a percentage of income, less amounts the State has to pay for problems caused by those children.",
