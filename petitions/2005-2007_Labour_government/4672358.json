        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition submits that most recent government policies and legislation related to reducing the carbon footprint and avoiding activities which exacerbate climate change have the impact of INCREASING the tax burden on citizens.\n\nThis petition asks the Prime Minister to consider more ways of tackling these issues by implementing policies which offer financial rewards and benefits for those who reduce the impact of their activities on the environment.\n\nPeople quickly become cynical when measures to supposedly improve the environment are put into effect that appear to be more about swelling the coffers of the Exchequer than achieving the stated goal. Therefore this partition puts to the Prime Minister that it is much better to ENCOURAGE participation by providing opportunities to DECREASE tax through desirable environmental behaviour.",
