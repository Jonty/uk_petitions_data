        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "This petition is asking that the Prime Minister establish a commons review panel to look into the ongoing issue of UK fiduciary services abusing the UK legal system by forcing legal action through courts when they have no intention of completing the legal route from the outset.  Currently this is causing courts to become clogged with cases that will never make it to court, and so ask that this is investigated to review whether the government can action changes to stop the legal system being used as a delaying and bullying tactic by large organisations on smaller organisations or individuals.",
