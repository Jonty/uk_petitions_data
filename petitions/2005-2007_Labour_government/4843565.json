        "background": "With the signing of the Maastricht Treaty the people of Britain were given duel citizenship \u2013 both European and British.  This extra tier of citizenship was thrust upon the people without their consent \u2013 and in many cases knowledge.\n\nThe people of Great Britain should be allowed the option of opting out of European citizenship if they so wish.  The Government will then be able to provide those who have opted out with British documentation only such as British (not EU) passports, driving licences and other national documents.  EU laws will also not apply to those who have opted out of European citizenship.",
