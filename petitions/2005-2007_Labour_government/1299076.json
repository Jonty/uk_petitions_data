I long for my England I knew as a small boy! We have been so weak as to adopt our own Mr. Bush! So I ask my brothers in arms, to stand tall for a lady that has given her whole life to her country. The mother of our country has never had the luxury of a simple dinner with her family. She has spent all those moments we cherish in the public eye. Why? Because you enjoy it. Our Queen has been Primped her whole life to be our champion and sure she and her family have made mistakes, but did we ever retire our parents when they didn't give us a biscuit? So I ask the TRUE Englishmen and Englishwomen of the world to stand for the women That Makes Us MERRY! She's more than a symbol of UNITY!  She\u2019s mum! SO ENGLAND...stand for the women who has give you her soul and not with reformed government. GOD SAVE OUR GRACIOUS QUEEN!  Mr. Bush go home!",
