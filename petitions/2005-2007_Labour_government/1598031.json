        "background": "The huge increase to the population from so many different countries is the reason Britain has lost it's way.  Prisons, schools, huge social issues, congestion on roads and terrorism is the result.  Britain has tried to squeeze in too much too soon.  Britain has lost it's identity as a result.  Too much money is wasted as a result of ridiculous human rights cases going to court, the list of waste is endless.  Britain is just too small to cope with any more pressure put on all public services. It is time to be honest and say Britain has lost 'it's way', we got it so wrong. Put the 'Great' back into 'Great Britain'",
