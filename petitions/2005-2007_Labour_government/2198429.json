            "background": "If motorways were made twin lane roads there would be outrage, so why do more and more so called drivers overtake then just stop in the middle or even the outter lanes and return to the near lane. Trucks, car and trailers,caravans etc have to flash drivers to get back over to avoid having to undertake \"middle laners\". When middle laners are flash at they normally refuse to be told by any other driver what to do, but if you undertake them its dangerous and illegal why do traffic police allow this, why are motorway signs not telling drivers to get over and why not like in Europe do signs advise were next fuel and price,time,date,weather etc. With so many highways 4x4 men traveling the highways why cant they pull over middle laners and make them take a motorway competance test. Why this style of lazy driving is not policed and stopped.",
