We dont need to have every area of our lives monitored and there are many factors which need to be  taken into account, like family sizes. Would they set average figures per family? what about people with different health/lifestyle needs? peoples homes? educational establishments? the paperwork would be a nightmare and the scheme another excuse to watch people and fine them at every opportunity.",
