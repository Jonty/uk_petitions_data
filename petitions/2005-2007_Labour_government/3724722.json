These councilors are elected to represent us and not the interest of big business. When the tyre dump at Newhaven when up in smoke about  5 years ago the smoke could be smelt in Easbourne. Peaople as far away as Hailsham had smuts on there washing. This burner will produce a far deadlier fallout over a greater area. The high chineys will give off low levels of all sorts of poisonous chemicals. You will not smell these but they will build up in the body and in the land giving rise to illness and birth deformities in people and livestock. Of course the people of Brighton will be safe with the provailing westerly wind (most of the time). Would they be happy if an incinerator was built at Worthing? East Sussex CC must listen to the electorate.",
