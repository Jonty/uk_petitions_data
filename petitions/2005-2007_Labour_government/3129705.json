        "background": "In America televison sponsers control televison and programs not a mogul who can do what they want and put on what they please whether or not it pleases the viewer or not and then to proceed year after year to increase prices on a license which is well past its due date. Let BBC understand the word 'NO,' to televison licensing and use sponsers like all the rest of our real televison stations have to do which put on programms which people are interested in and have a say so in.  If not then give the people the right to have the freedom of their constitutional right to vote yes or no to televison licensing. Time to tell BBC that they are the 'Weekest Link,' where televison and our taxes are concerned.  Time to stop a company who has a monopoly on televison and our rights to view it free of charge.",
