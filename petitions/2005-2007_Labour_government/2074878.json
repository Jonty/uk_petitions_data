            "background": "VAT is currently applicable on digitised downloadable material such as ebooks, music and software, this levy should be abolished.\n\nDownloadable material helps save the environment in many ways \u2013 energy in the manufacturing of hard versions of such products is eliminated \u2013 co2 emissions reduced to nil.\n\nTrees are saved, downloadable material uses no paper or cardboard.\n\nMusic and software no longer need plastic cd cases.\n\nTransportation of the hard copies of these goods is eliminated, huge saving on co2 emissions.\n\nLandfill for packaging and the products is nil.\n \nTotal environmental savings of digitised goods worldwide is huge. The government is quick to add a green tax onto air travel, but fails to recognise the green savings of digitised products. \n\nAbolishing VAT on these products would encourage more companies to offer their products in a downloadable  digital format.\n\nPlease sign the petition to abolish VAT on these goods and make the world a greener place.",
