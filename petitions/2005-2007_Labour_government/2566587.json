            "background": "I request that First Class Travel on Trains be scrapped. I commute into London (for which I pay \u00a3150 a month) and find it extremely annoying to have to stand in standard accomodation whilst there are many empty seats in the first class accomodation. \n\nI believe that this separation of the accomodation on Britain's railways is extremely divisive and emphasises all that's bad about Britain's 'class' system. \n\nI believe that all travellers should be travelling 'First Class' and that comfortable travel shouldn't be a privelege to be enjoyed by the few.\n\nIndeed, I look forward to a day when all travellers can travel as one, shoulder to shoulder, in comfort and safety, as they speed to their destination. \n\nLet's throw off the shackles and finally do away with 'First Class' travel.\n\nLiberation now !",
