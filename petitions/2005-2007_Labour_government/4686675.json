            "background": "Some young men lack role models. Those of them who have personal disorders and feel rejected, are seeking attention and are looking to make an impression, could be influenced by bad role models who get publicity from their shootings, as witnessed on American schools and campuses. Short of alternatives to express their anger, they may be significantly inspired by these young gunmen, and seek to emulate these acts of hatred and violence  - to inflict more pain and attract more publicity. There is absolutely no gain at all to let the video and photos of Cho Seung-hu being shown on the media.  In the current escalation of violence among young men and the wider use of weapons with intent to kill, we have a duty, and it makes more sense, to give publicity to good role models.",
