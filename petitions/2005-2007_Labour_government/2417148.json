            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "All plastic is recyleable, all of it, even mixed, dirty household plastic.  There is a company in Wolverhampton making fencing from margerine tubs, milk bottles, nylon tights, pop bottles, plant pots, car parts, inkjet cartriges etc..   It is possible, but instead we threw away 5,000,000 tonnes of plastic to land fill last year alone.  Increasing landfill tax on plastics to \u00a3100/tonne ( currently \u00a321 ) would force local authorities to think twice and also allow recycling companies to charge gate fees to justify investment in machines.  The technology to save the planet is out there, it works and it is not science fiction.  Please take your heads out of the sand and stop telling us what cannot be done.  Recycling is a viable alternative if the financial incentives are there to use the available technology.",
