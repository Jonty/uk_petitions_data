        "background": "Lets make prisons a punishment for crimes commited, not a place to return to time and time again because they provide a comfy bed and good hot meals, let alone remote control cable TV in their rooms, playstations, pool tables, fully equipped gyms & lessons in crime from fellow holiday campers. Why should law abiding, tax paying, HONEST people like me, who have never been in trouble with the police, have to pay to keep these criminals in luxury. Its time to make a stand, get rid of the DO GOODERS and their prisoners rights rubbish and show that crime NO LONGER pays. They are there because they did wrong, no matter what it was and they shouldnt be rewarded for it.",
