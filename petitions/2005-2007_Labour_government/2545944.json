            "background": "If \"safety\" cameras are there to slow vehicles down and not raise funds, I propose to have markings on the road surface showing that there is a: - \n 1. Speed cam in E.G. 100 yards\n  2. Speed limit E.G. 30MPH       This can be done easily with a speed cam sign the same as on the road side signs and the traditional speed limit signs like those already used on the road surface.\nIn addition the rear of every speed camera is to be marked with a high visibility\nMarking showing the limit covered by the camera e.g. 30, 40 ,50 etc.\nThis if done will reduce the revenue from cameras but also it will reduce the \"did not see the warning signs\" complaints from drivers BUT it will also slow vehicles down at \u201caccident black spots\u201d.",
