            "background": "A decision has been made to build a massive Waste Transfer Station in Brighton next door to an Infants school, in a residential area, and next door to Elderly Housing. Several schools and a large community will be affected bringing 44 tonne lorries directly into conflict with pedestrians in a built up residential area, directly contradicting Government Sure Start objectives on health, education and well being. \nWe call on the Prime Minister to over turn this absurd, corrupted decision and place Education in Brighton and Hove above Waste Management.",
