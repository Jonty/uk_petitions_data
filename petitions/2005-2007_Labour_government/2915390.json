            "background": "We currently use bulk LPG for domestic heating, hot water and cooking. There is no real competition between suppliers and changing suppliers is costly and inconvenient as this involves high charges by the existing supplier for removal of the gas tank and any gas and the installation of a new tank by the new supplier. The government should introduce regulation enabling customers to change suppliers by continuing to rent the tank from the existing supplier and buying gas from another or by transfering the ownership of the tank to the new supplier.  As there are so few suppliers of domestic LPG there is no real competition and consideration should be given to regulating prices by statute.  When prices were at their highest my supplier introduced a \"temporary\" surcharge of over 5pence per litre which is still in place despite falls in wholesale prices.",
