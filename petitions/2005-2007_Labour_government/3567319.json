            "background": "The Government must take into consideration the plight of people on retirement pensions who cannot afford the increasing rate of the Community Charge.  Pensioners should be entitled to a reduction of the Community Charge and not continue to be subject to the current totally unfair charges which discriminates against elderly retired people.  The increased charges for 2007 are likely to result in the spectacle of pensioners appearing in court and either  being ordered to find the money or receive a custodial sentence. Many pensioners have had to sell their homes.  This is an appalling situation which the government has not made any attempt to resolve.",
