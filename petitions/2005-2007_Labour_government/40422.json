            "background": "I have recently been told that our children will not be recieving the T.B immunisation.The government think that it is now low risk.I enquired about this to a local doctor who claimed that the only people that would recieve this were people at risk ie Asian families etc.According to this docter all immagrants are screened for this before entering the country but what about illegal imagrants how are they screened? I feel really strongly about this and want to ask Mr Blair how he can give us his garentee that our children will not come into contact with this infection.Please sign this petition to help get our children immunised to minimise the risk that they are at.Thank you.",
