            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Since Privatisation, the cost of walk-up rail fares has increased many times above the rate of inflation due to both direct fare increases, and more importantly, through restrictions on ticket validity.  Leisure fares have been particularly badly hit, as they are not controlled through the Government\u2019s Regulated Fares policy.\n\nTo counter this, the Train Companies (TOCs) have introduced a hugely complex system of advanced purchase tickets.  Advanced purchase tickets, being valid only on the specified train, have taken away the flexibility offered by walk-up tickets.  This inflexibility combined with high prices on walk-up leisure fares makes rail uncompetitive in terms of both price and convenience when compared with the car for leisure travellers.  As a result, the number of journeys made by leisure travellers stands at only 20% of the total rail journeys made, with large numbers of unoccupied seats on off-peak trains.\n\nLeisure travellers want fairly priced walk-up flexible tickets.",
