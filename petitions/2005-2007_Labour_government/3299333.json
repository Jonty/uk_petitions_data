            "background": "People when they get to a certain age will need to be looked after (you will too some day), especially as some do not have the luxury of a family to look after them when they are no longer able to do so themselves. Most elderly people can not afford to pay for care in a private care home and so are forced to attend one provided by the local council. Spaces and indeed the homes themselves are increasingly in short supply.\n\nThis petition is to ensure the government provide the elderly with sufficient care regardless how much they can afford to pay.",
