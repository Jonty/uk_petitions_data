        "background": "Please reconsider the proposed ban on the purchase of 'Samurai Swords'.The term is both abstract and difficult to define, something even those with an in-depth knowledge dispute, and just 80 classified serious incidents in 4 years is scant justification for this proposition.\n\nThe law already states that swords must be sold blunt, and that carrying them in public will lead to arrest. The fact of the matter is that they are no more dangerous than any un-worked piece of metal; with most, sharpening the blades will merely cause them to snap. These weapons therefore do not pose danger enough to warrant their banning.\n\nPlease reconsider the intended ban, and focus on issues that will benefit the population rather than penalise a harmless hobby by punishing collectors. What is needed is a crackdown on the criminals, not the blaming of their actions on the item a small number choose to carry.",
