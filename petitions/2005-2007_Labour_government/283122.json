            "background": "It should be a criminal offence potentially punsihable by imprisonment to supply any person under the age of 18 with any tobacco product. This includes by sale or gift with the responsibility for checking the age to be with the provider at all times. All sales should be face to face- cigarette machines should be withdrawn. It should be illegal for any person under the age of 18 to attampt to purchase any tobacco product or for any person to act as an accessory to such a sale. It should be illegal for any person under 18 to import any tobacco products.\n Smokers generally start at school, often by peer or family pressure. Those who do not smoke at 18 are unlikely to start. The greatest public health gain that can be made is by imposing strict policies to minimise supply of this apppalling product. Much has been done but there is much further to go and this petition asks the Prime Minsiter to build on recent foundations",
