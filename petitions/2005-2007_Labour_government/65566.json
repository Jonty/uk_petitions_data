        "background": "I have just read something that has appalled me.  That the government put VAT on foods such as smoothies, fruit juices, dried fruit, rice cakes etc but don't on foods such as frozen pizza's, chips, milk shakes, ready meals etc.\nThe government are wanting us to eat healthier, this in turn would help the struggling NHS if we had more healthy people out there.  Where is the justice in putting VAT on healthy foods???  My petition is to take the VAT off healthy foods so that more people out there, especially those watching their pennies can actually afford to buy healthy food!",
