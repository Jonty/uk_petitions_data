            "background": "It is important for children to learn about democracy and the system which makes this country work, I believe more democratic activities like \"School councils\" or \"Class presidents (or prime ministers!)\" should be encouraged.\n\nIn the US, \"Class presidents\" are common place, giving students a chance to take part in the democratic system and feel what it is like to run for office and be in a public post. \"School/class councils\" are becoming more popular in the UK, with students being elected to bridge the gap between student and teacher/head oligarch, but they are not common enough yet.\n\nThese programs give children a taste of democracy and how important it is and will hopefully inspire more of them to take part in public office. Maybe even future Prime Ministers will be born of this.",
