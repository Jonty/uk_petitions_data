        "background": "At present the Fees to make an application as the Spouse of a British Resident in the UK is \u00a3335 for a Postal Application and a Premium application \u00a3500. It has been proposed to increase this to \u00a3750 for a Postal Application and \u00a3950 for a Premium\n\nThe fees charged are at a reasonable rate already and there is no solid justification for nearly doubling the amount to charge and pass it off as \"a way to set fees at levels that minimise the operational risk to Home Office businesses whilst generating the revenue for the next four years to help fund the transformation of the immigration system.\" \n\nWhy should people who want to stay in the UK as Spouses pay for the future of the immigration with so much of their hard earned salary when they are not already allowed access to public funds and in some circumstances treated as second rate citizens until they have their indefinite leave to remain?\n\nFor someone on \u00a314000 a year thats 65% of their monthly income bofore tax has been deducted. Surely this is a stealth tax that should be stopped. Don't increase the fees for this specific application.",
