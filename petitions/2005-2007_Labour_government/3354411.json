            "background": "The Jethro Tull band is generally linked with the progressive music movement of the seventies. But the band is still alive and well today, still led by the singer, flautist and guitarist Ian Anderson, who writes almost all the music, and assisted by long term guitarist Martin Barre. Refusing to bow to musical fashions, Ian Anderson has led this band through the years, always making inventive and interesting music and recording albums which always sell well. The band usually embarks on a punishing tour schedule every year, still packs large auditoriums and still has an army of loyal fans. In 2008 this band will celebrate it\u2019s 40th anniversary. There are precious few British bands with such longevity. Whatever you think of their music (and believe it or not I am NOT a diehard fan) one must appreciate what Anderson and Barre have achieved over the years. I am petitioning for Ian Anderson and Martin Barre to be recognised in the 2008 New Years Honours list.",
