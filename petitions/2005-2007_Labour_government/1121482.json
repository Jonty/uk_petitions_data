            "background": "By planting plant material that is dense and colourful the French authorities have already proved that it is feasible. It is my opinion that their motorways are more safe, less distracting and more pleasant to drive on.\n\nThe Main Benefits would be:-\nReduce headlight glare from oncoming traffic.\nReduce the effect of water spray that drifts across carriageways in very wet weather.\nTo improve road safety by forcing drivers to concentrate on events on the carriageway on which they are travelling, especially when incidents occur on the opposite carriageway  that cause drivers to drive unnessarily and dangerously slowly.\nTo improve the general ambience of the road system.\nTo hide the enormous quantities of roadside litter that impacts negatively on the countryside.\nTo reverse, to a degree, the negative ecological impact of road building by planting species that are particularily good at absorbing toxins produced from burning fossil fuels \nTo provide a habitat for wildlife.",
