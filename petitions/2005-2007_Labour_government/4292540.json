            "background": "Steve McClaren was part of the previous regime that saw the England football team become an exceptional unit, expertly utilising the quality of player at the management teams' disposal . The verve and style with which they dominated games was reminiscent of the wonderful Holland sides of the 1970s. McClaren has continued this in his role as manager and has even built on it so that Sven now looks like he was a great and charismatic manager, and has improved on this by bringing his own vast wealth of tactical and coaching knowledge to the fray, as well as demonstrating a firm grasp of how the European and international game should be played. If McClaren goes it will be a sad loss to the international arena and he may be forced back into club football, the place where he first displayed his prowess in European football with that woeful 5-1 thrashing at the hands of Sevilla in the 2005 UEFA Cup Final for Middlesbrough. (For Scotsmen, Irishmen and the Welsh only!!!)",
