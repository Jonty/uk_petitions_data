            "background": "There are many taxes that we are forced to endure that are supposed to encourage us to do or not to do something.  For instance, the increased road tax on \"gas-guzzlers\" is to reduce the number of this type of vehicle on our roads.  This tax would be more credible if it were to be spent on carbon reduction.  It is not even spent on the road network which in itself would contribute to carbon reduction!  A huge amount of carbon is pumped into the atmosphere by the millions of vehicles that are stuck in traffic jams each day around the country, while the government continues to make cuts in the road building programme and spends a minute amount of the billions of road tax raised actually on the road network.  Is the government really interested in carbon reduction or just using this as an excuse to further increase taxation?",
