            "background": "High intensity rear fog lights were introduced as a safety measure some years ago when lighting technology for cars was relatively basic. In modern cars rear lights can easily be seen in poor light conditions and those motorists utilising their rear fog lights merely dazzle following motorists or appear to be braking thus creating a hazard in itself, particularly on Motorways. They should be banned as a safety measure as soon as legislation allows.",
