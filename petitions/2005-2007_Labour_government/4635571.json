        "action": "Stop the proposed law that forces ALL HGV vehicles to be restricted to the same speed, particularly on dual carriageways and motorways.  With the best will in the world, some laden lorries will be forced to slow down by their weight when going uphill and conversely, slightly faster when going down hill.  This legislation will see unladen lorries trying to overtake laden lorries on uphill stretches.  This will result in the nearside two lanes being blocked for miles at a time, causing greater congestion.  Instead the limits to be imposed should be 60mph for HGV3 (7.5 ton) 57mph for HGV2  and 54mph for HGV1",
