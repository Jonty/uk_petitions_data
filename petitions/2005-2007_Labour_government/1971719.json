        "action": "re-think the whole system of collecting ROAD FUEL TAX from the legal road user and penalising those road users not legally allowed to use the road",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Allegedly there are up to 2million vehicles on British roads that are not 'TAXED' & probably in most cases also not Insured. To keep a vehicle running on the road there is a need to put FUEL into that vehicle.\n Surely it must be more cost effective to implement ONE SINGLE TAX at the point of sale on such FUEL - therefore every vehicle that has fuel bought for it is then paying the relevant TAX.\n For every mile used there is a direct contribution made to the Treasurers coffers. The MOT cert. & valid Insurance cert. can be used to allow the legal purchase of fuel.\nThis in itself would not stop illegal vehicle useage, but the collections of ROAD FUND TAXATION/DUTY would be taken from ALL FUEL USERS - FAIRLY.\nThis could also have a knock on effect, vehicle users may think twice about short unnecessary trips, & engine manufacturers may think about making their engines more efficient.\nWhich car maker will be the first to come out with the 100 miles/gallon car.",
