            "background": "The London Lorry Control Scheme (LLCS), or London Lorry Ban (LLB), has been in existence since 1986. It was set up to protect Londoners against the disturbance caused by heavy lorries at night and at weekends. Its objective is to reduce noise nuisance at antisocial times by minimising the activity of heavy lorries. Under the scheme, lorries over 18 tonnes are banned during specified times. The LLB applies to the whole of the Greater London area.\nThe entire nation is entitled to a good night's sleep and a restful weekend, and I propose that the LLB should be extended to prevent HGVs over 18 tonnes from travelling on all UK non-motorway routes between 10pm-6am Monday-Saturday, and from 1pm\nSaturday to 6am Monday.",
