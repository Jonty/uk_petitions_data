            "background": "The Government has published the Local Government and Patient Involvement in Health Bill which included the proposed abolition of Patient and Public Involvement forum, PPI forums were set up at the end off 2004 to monitor and review the services arranged and or provided by the trust from the perspective of the patient \u2013 this includes both the range and operation of services, seek the views of patients receiving services provided or arranged by the trust, inspect premises where NHS services are delivered, make reports and recommendations based on the views and experiences of patients and carers to the trust management. The Government wishes to replace them with the LINks - Local Involvement Networks, which would mean that Specialist Forum would lost there power and there would not be a LINks assign to a Specialist Forum but it would be in one big LINks covering the whole Local Authority area.",
