I'm calling for this to be raised to a reasonable level or a full state pension as citizans of this country. Where other people of other origins are receiveing Income Support at a higher level than the true British citizan this cannot be right. This needs to be rectified by government. Women cannot be ignored any longer and many face poverty in old age a decent pension,  as citizens, full British citizans should be our  right, this should be established forthwith. Everyone as the right to a pension so why are women who stayed at home to raise children penalised for doing so.",
