Furthermore, why should they then face the double whammy of funding addiction and than having to foot the NHS bill to treat the illnesses of smokers.\n\nIF PEOPLE CAN AFFORD TO SMOKE THEY DONT NEED WELFARE BENEFITS.\n\nThis may also work as an incentive to get people to give up smoking or to get a job.",
