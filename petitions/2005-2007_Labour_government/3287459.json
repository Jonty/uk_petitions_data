The building, through Les\u2019s hard work, benefited from the investment of \u00a3250,000. The funding came from the Wirral Waterfront Initiative and Sure Start Birkenhead North and Les was instrumental in securing it.     \nLes\u2019s contributions to the centre have been immense and its no surprise to discover why he has been nominated twice before in the queen\u2019s honours lists.",
