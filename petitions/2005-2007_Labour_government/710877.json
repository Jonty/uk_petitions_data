Change is necessary but too many initiatives that are ill thought through, poorly costed and in many instances unworkable are eminating from the government wrapped up as improving patient care but actually are about just saving money and winning votes. Change needs to be  given time to implement and to reap the benefit. Change on political whim benefits no one but politicians",
