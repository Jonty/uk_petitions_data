            "background": "At present rod licences are sold per 2 rods at a cost of \u00a322 per licence ,as most specimen anglers tend to use 3 rods each they still have to pay for 2 licences at a cost of \u00a344 ,match anglers only tend to use 1 rod at a time ,in this case you are paying \u00a311 extra for a rod which is not being used , therefore the goverment should urge the EA to rethink and charge the rod licences per rod",
