            "background": "Currently if claiming the benefit disability living allowance (dla) as a british citizen you may only draft your claim up to three months from the start of your claim. However if you are lucky enough to be an asylum seeker claiming disability living allowance (dla) and are able to prove your illness commenced up to five years previously you will be able to have your claim paid from this time which is a clear discrimination against the british people\n\nI demand a stop to this practice with immediate effect",
