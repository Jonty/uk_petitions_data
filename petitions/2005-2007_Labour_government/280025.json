            "background": "As we all know, many serious criminals or repeat offenders often get away with unjust punishment for their crimes.\n\nMy solution would be:\n\n1, To turn some public stadiums into arenas for corporal punishment.\n\n2, Allow victims families to impose any form of physical or mental punishment to offenders of very serious crimes (ie against children) resulting in death if they wish.\n\n3, Allow victims of less serious crimes to impose punishment or sentences from a agreed list.\n\n4, Bring back the stocks and hanging.\n\n5, Make parents of ASBO kids stand trial for repeat crimes in a public arena.\n\n6, Give any money made from stadium gate reciepts or TV advertising break money to the victims families as compensation.\n\n7, Make lying and deception by politicians, and civil servents a criminal offence, subject to automatic inprisonment of 5 years hard labour.\n\n8, Bring back chain gangs.",
