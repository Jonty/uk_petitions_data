If found positive police have the right to search the individual further but not arrest for the trace of drugs found on their hands.\nThis petition wants those individuals to face further drugs testing and to find people who test positive for illegal substances to be able to be prosecuted for drug use.\nCurrent law shows that possession of a drug is illegal but once the drug is taken the individual can no longer be arrested for it unless driving or causing a public nuisance.\n\n\nThis petition wants individuals who the police feel maybe under the effect of drugs to face further drugs testing and to find people who test positive for illegal substances to be able to be prosecuted for drug use.",
