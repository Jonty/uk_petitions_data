The UN, various NGOs, other governments and even the British Foriegn Office recognise the dire situation in Iraq and the danger faced by the people there. The British Home Office however has started the forced deportation of Iraqi's. Those deportees face extreme danger, an uncertain future and the likelihood of being killed. If more are forced to return they too will be in danger and could be killed. We ask the government to allow Iraqi's, already here in the UK, to stay here.",
