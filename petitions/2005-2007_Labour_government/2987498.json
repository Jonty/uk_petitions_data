        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Current guidelines operated by local council swimming pools suggest that one adult should accompany one child under the age of 5, or one adult to 2 children under the age of 8.  This means that many families with 3 children will not be able to access the local pool, nor will single parent families.  We ask that during these times of high obesity in children that the prime minister reviews this guidance so that we are able to take part in an activity together that will improve our health whilst having fun as a family.  Please allow families to swim with our children",
