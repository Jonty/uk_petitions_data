            "background": "The clinic at the Homeopathic Hospital has been under threat of closure since last year, and if it were to close it would save a mere \u00a3160,000 per year.  If the patients were to recieve conventional medicine it would cost the NHS far more than this saving. Homeopathic treatment is a vital lifeline for patients with conditions ranging from allergies to cancer.  Homeopathic treatment is supported by millions of patients worldwide (our own Royal Family included) and to stop our funding will be total a disaster for thousands of patients.  Thank you!",
