            "background": "Following exposures of widespread ongoing fraud by the BBC etc in call centres located in places such as Hyderabad India, there is understandably a lot of concern about fraud & data protection issues when private information is sent to off shore call centres. If companies were forced to give callers the option to be dealt with by a call centre located in the UK then this concern would be satisfied. Allowing personal data to be used or stored offshore should also be an \"opt in\" option so that the default answer is no this will mean that when markets such as China, South America etc open up the problem is not repeated & people who do not readilly understand the questions are protected by default.",
