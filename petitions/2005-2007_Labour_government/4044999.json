            "background": "There is some local resistance in the creation of a 'megamosque; in east london. However, like me, and possibly many more, i believe a 'megamosque' would hugely benefit what is currently a deprived area of the country. The 'mega mosque' would not only provide religious services but would serve the entire community by introducing social activities, creating a sense of belonging and educating people about doing good in their lives and for the community. By far, it is a much better plan then to introduce casinos in the area!",
