        "background": "ITV have created a website to encourage viewers and programme followers to assist and compete in finding the murderer of Tom King. The site is a competition and as such should offer equal opportunities to all. In reality the site constantly locks up at crucial moments or allows some competitors to enter information and answers to clues whilst others cannot as the servers will not cope with the demand. ITV are  earning money from the associated advertising etc whilst many people playing the game in an attempt to win the prizes are denied opportunities due to the shortcomings of the organizers. ITV have received a number of complaints directly and via the various internet forums but the website remains very unreliable and continues to frustrate most players.",
