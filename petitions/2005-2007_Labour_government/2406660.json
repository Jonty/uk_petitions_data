        "background": "Excessive and habitual car use has gone unchallenged for many years. With the freedom to drive comes a responsibility to consider its impact. However, people are either oblivious to or chose to ignore the damaging consequences. Road pricing in conjunction with fuel tax is a viable method of creating a strong enough financial incentive to force people to consider alternative forms of transport. The levy should then be used to improve public transport.",
