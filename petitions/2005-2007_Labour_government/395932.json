            "background": "It is widely accepted that the UK's roads are in a deplorable condition yet British motorists continue to be squeezed until their pips squeak, this situation must not be allowed to continue! Motorists contribute around \u00a370 billion to the chancellor's funds through duty on fuel, the road-fund licence and of course VAT on new cars, yet only a minute amount of this is invested in the UK's crumbling road infrastructure. I believe the government should commit to using this revenue to embark on a full maintenance programme to bring the  UK roads up to a standard equivalent to our European partners and not those of a third world country. Only once this is done should any surplus funds be used for other non-motoring related purposes.",
