        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I think that every person that buys or gets a dog should be made to pay a fee. All dogs should be chipped so that if they throw the dogs out they are fined for doing such a terrible thing.\n     if there is a genuine reason to have to give a dog up, it is a diffrent matter. I visited a dogs home this afternoon and how sad that people can have them for 2 to 3 years or more and give them up.\n They have feelings like us. How sad they looked in the kennels. I have a friend who has just got a dog aged 12 years. its first owner got rid of him because the story goes they were moving. What a load of nonsense and you being the prime minister i would have thought could do something about this major problem. A dog is for LIFE and it is not a toy that can be pushed from pillar to post. please bring a law in to cover these poor animals and it would stop all these unwanted dogs. if people are genuine they will pay for a liscence and to have it chipped.\nThank you",
