            "background": "Government and non-Government organisations are in the process of issuing  reports (some have advocated the setting up of 'hit squads' to take corrective action!) which state that riots are expected in rural England because of the high levels of eastern european immigration.  This confirms what Enoch Powell forecast in his 'Rivers of Blood' speech in Birmingham on 20 April 1968 for which he was villified.  We now know that to be a truthful prophecy made because of his deep concern over the future of our heritage and our nationality.  He should be honoured, posthumously, by a nation which should be grateful to him for his dire, accurate, warning, but chose to ignore him and for which we are now paying the highest possible price - complete loss of our culture, our heritage AND our nationality.",
