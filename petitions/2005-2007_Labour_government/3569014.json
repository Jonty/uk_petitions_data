The term should be replaced with Separated municipalities or something similar which is used in canada to help define a city within a county.For example it just confuses people into believeing that bolton,stockport and oldham is part of manchester while it is actually a city with its own identity with in the Greater Manchester County.Also no one really knows where a city needs and another one begins so they should have city limits which is very important so people know where London ends and the city of Luton,Standsted and Guildford within the Greater London County begins if they dont stop this Leicester will be part of Birmingham,Motherwell will be part of Glasgow and Cardiff will be part of Bristol.",
