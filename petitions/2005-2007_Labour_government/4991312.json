            "background": "Mars / Masterfoods have now started to use animal rennet in their confectionary, which means they are no longer suitable for vegetarians. Approximately 6% of the population are vegetarian and at a stroke they have bizarrely eliminated a sizeable portion of their customer base. It is extremely rare for a company to use rennet in their chocolate and completely unnecessary. Rennet is made from deep frozen lamb or calf stomachs from which enzymes are then extracted. \nPlease sign this petition to put pressure on the company so that everyone can enjoy Galazy, Mars, Twix, Bounty and numerous other Masterfoods chocolate products.",
