For a website like mine and many others, whom do not make money from them, its out of our league.\n\nMy site is a discussion forum and if we cannot discuss future fixtures without fear of being sued then what can we discuss. It really does take the discussion out of my forums.\n\nI would like to make it that all non profit organisations and fan websites can use the fixture lists free of charge and without the thread of legal action hanging over us.",
