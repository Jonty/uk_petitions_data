Why should the long term unemployed have 300 TV channels this is a luxury not a social right. Imagine the reduced need for immigration, reduced crime, increased available workforce, the desire for people to work harder and look after their job this could increase the quality of British produce that could in turn demand higher export values. Oh and imagine the savings we could enjoy on our taxes.",
