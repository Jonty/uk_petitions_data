            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Underachieving schools must be turned around without eroding well performing schools.\n\nThe government plans to abolish catchment areas because of the negative impact of the current system:\n\n  1) housing and accommodation costs in the vicinity of a good school spiral upward\n\n  2) other schools are deprived of their share of \"better\" pupils\n\nThis action is similar to manipulation of free markets. If the government acted like this toward free enterprise, it would be ILLEGAL.\n\nThe government is trying to close the gap by changing the effect. It should be looking at the cause.\n\nThe government needs to change its policies to invest in new teaching methods, better teachers and to give schools disciplinary powers back.",
