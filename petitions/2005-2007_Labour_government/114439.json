        "background": "We the BRITISH people feel it`s time that the British Goverment actually backed it`s British people rather than Publicly denouncing the British people.\n\nTherefore I believe This/Future Goverment should Impliment Background checks on ALL citizens.\n  Those who have British heritage of Over 100 years (minimum) should be rewarded (British Heritage Certificate,Cash,etc).  The longer the background check continues for being British,the reward also to signify this (British Heritage certificate in colour classes ie Standard  for 100 years,Bronze for 200 years,Silver for 500 years,Gold for 800+,also Greater cash,etc reward for this too).\nThis could also be incorporated into Birth certificates of family lines,the longer the heritage the change to the Certificate Borderings.\n\n It`s about time we British were made to feel welcomed in our own country & this would certainly show the True British compared to the Immigrants.",
