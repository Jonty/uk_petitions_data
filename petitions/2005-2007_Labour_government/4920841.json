            "background": "We wish to have a legal framework put in place whereby the people can raise issues by petition and if there is sufficient interest, as indicated by the number of signatures, then the Government will be legally required to hold a referendum on the issue and be bound to act in accordance with the result. The signature threshold should be sufficient to prevent abuse but not such as to prevent people raising issues they feel strongly about. This mechanism should apply at both local and national level. We believe this to be an important evolution of democracy, one which can be readily implemented using existing technology and proposed voting infrastructure.",
