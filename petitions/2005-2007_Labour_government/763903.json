            "background": "The current treatments for addicts are not best for addicts or society as a whole.\n\nHeroin addiction is a health problem and should be treated as such, addicts should be free to obtain perscriptions for heroin from their doctor.\n\nThese should allow addicts to recieve as much heroin as they require from specialised clinics able to provide heroin and sterile injection equipment, where it will be consumed on site to prevent leakage to the illicit market.\n\nThis will reduce HIV etc and also reduce aquisitive crime, Heroin maintence is more effective than current programs.\n\nThe savings in crime & criminal justice costs will cover the treatment costs.\n\nAddicts treated in this way will be able to rejoin the workforce with help and councelling returning from a life of crime and become active members of society once more.\n\nThis will benifit the addicts themselves and society as a whole by ensuring addicts are treated with dignity, health and crime costs are reduced.",
