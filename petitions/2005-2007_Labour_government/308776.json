She was made aware that as the disease progressed she would loose the ability to speak take food or liquid by mouth and slowly loose the use of her limbs but her brain would remain active throughout.  When asked if there was any hope of a cure the specialist replied that only a substantial increase in the funding for research could help so please Mr Blair commit your goverment to grant the \u00a37.5 million needed.  It will be too late for Margaret but will give hope to others.",
