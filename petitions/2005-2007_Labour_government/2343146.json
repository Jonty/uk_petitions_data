            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Ten years ago the Cabinet Office issued guidance to Public Bodies entitled \"Quangos: Opening the Doors\" requiring Public Bodies to hold Open Public Meetings when issuing Annual Reports and Accounts. This would give an opportunity for members of the public and stakeholders to question the management of Public Bodies about how well they have carried out their duties, in the same way all Public Limited Companies have to hold AGMs and be accountable to their shareholders. The Public own Public Bodies and should have the same opportunity to hear from the management of Public Bodies how well they have served the Public. Unfortunately many Public Bodies have ignored the Cabinet Office guidance and failed to hold Annual Open Meetings. The guidance does not even apply to Public Bodies that are Executive Agencies with Trading Status that make a profit from their services.\nPlease support this E-Petition to the Prime Minister by signing the petition at http://petitions.pm.gov.uk/publicmeetings/",
