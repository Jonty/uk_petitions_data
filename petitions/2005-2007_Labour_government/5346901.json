            "background": "We petition that funds allocated to all areas of the country by government is shared equally, this will mean that thoughts who live in inner cities or rural areas, whether they are Scotland Wales or England have the same amount allocated per head of population as any other area. This will stop the vast discrepancies and injustices of regional discrimination and the unfair benefits to health, transport, social services and education that some areas have while others areas pay more but get much less in return.",
