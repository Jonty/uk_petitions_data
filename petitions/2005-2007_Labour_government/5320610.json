Radio Times informs us, as background to a play broadcast on 17th June, that \"on average men in the City earn 48%(!) more than women for doing the same job; in the country as a whole that differential is 22%\" but there shouldn't be ANY DIFFERENTIAL AT ALL for men and women doing the same job; this was outlawed in 1970.  This massive injustice - one of the worst manifestations of gender inequality there is - must be ended now!",
