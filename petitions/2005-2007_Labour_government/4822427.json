            "background": "This petition has been raised to realise public opinion about the use of cannabis, in relation to contradictions that I believe form an entrapment based debate between the electorate, and our Great British Government.\n\nYou can buy seeds to grow cannabis, meaning the government is receiving VAT upon the sale of the seeds, and applying taxes when the seeds are imported. But this money is likely to be spent upon the enforcement of not allowing the use of cannabis. A truly pointless cycle.\n\nHow can the use of cannabis be condemned when you can easily purchase seeds, equipment and accessories? The government should control it, earn money from it, and permit use of the drug. After all, how many users of cannabis do you see going out and fighting on the streets after having one too many?\n\nStop discriminating the electorate, and the huge majority of people who use the drug. You know, the doctors, teachers and other professionals who feel a natural part of their lifestyle is shamefully restricted.",
