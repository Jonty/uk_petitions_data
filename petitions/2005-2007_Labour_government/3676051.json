            "background": "The tax on overtime working hours dont seems unfair especialy to the lower income people. We normal stay behind at work, spending our sparetime to try to make extra earning, taking tax on that money is absolutely insane. Everyone should be able to earn the overtime payment without paying a tax because the tax that we are paying on our nomal salary is more than enough. Bare in mind, we are paying council tax, rent/morgage, trasport etc  list goes on and on. The cost of liveing goes up and up every year and the salary dont seems to rise to fill the gap of the life standard.",
