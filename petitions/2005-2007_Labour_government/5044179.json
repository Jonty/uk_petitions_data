            "background": "Southern Water want to build a sewage treatment plant on the South Downs on the fringe of a town called Peacehaven.  The land is an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, amid rolling hills and a fantastic array of wildlife.  The Downland is beautiful and does not deserve to be developed for industrial use- for any reason.  The option of citing an alternative complex elsewhere on brownfield sites does not make financial sense to Southern Water, so it is largely for financial reasons that we must watch another tragic instance of the South Downs losing to industry and it's shareholders.\nDuring these times of environmental awareness, I call for the PM in waiting, Gordon Brown and his list of hopefull deputies to prove their green credentials and stop Southern Water concreting over any part of the South Downs.",
