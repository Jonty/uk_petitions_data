        "action": "Instruct Gordon Brown to replace full ROCS payment for Biofuels used in co-firing power stations instead of reducing it by half in direct contravension of our obligations under the Kyoto protocol",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "There is only one liquid biofuel currently available to replace or partly replace heavy fuel oil as start-up or flame stabilisation fuel in coal fired power stations. As with all biofuels it is more expensive than mineral fuels but is non polluting and carbon neutral. Gordon Brown has reduced the ROCS (rebate payments) by half thus making it too expensive to use. This seems to be a cynical ploy to force power generators to use mineral heavy fuel oil, which is cheaper but polluting.",
