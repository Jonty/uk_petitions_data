The National Blood Service only alludes to the subject of \u2018homosexuality\u2019 yet it discriminates.\nThere are thousands of willing gay men with clean blood who currently cannot donate, are made to feel inferior and whose friends & family members choose not to donate in protest.\nIn place of outdated and intrusive questions and assumptions this essential service needs a Government monitored scientifically reliable blood-screening process that does not screen out homosexuals in the name of safety for \u2018everyone else\u2019.",
