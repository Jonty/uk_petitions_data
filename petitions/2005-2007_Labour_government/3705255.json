            "background": "Whilst it will always be true that the relationship between Britain and Ireland has often had a sad past, it is also true that the ties that bind us are arguably much the stronger. Who amongst us in Britain, for example, doesnt have Irish relatives in their family tree? Not many, i,ll wager.For me, Feb 24 at Croke Park, was a defining moment in the relationship between us. It has always struck me that at the Commonwealth games a huge gap is left by the absence of our Irish friends. A country whose citizens have shared and contributed so much to our past and continue to do so.And who contribute greatly to UN peacekeeping efforts around the world. I know from my own past experience there will be extremes of opinion from various quarters. History cannot be re-written. But at the end of the day it is just that. History. The world moves on. Now is the time for Ireland,a proud, Independent nation to come in and stand amongst equals.",
