            "action": "Make it legal for Mark Thomas (the political activist / satire comedian) to demonstrate in parliament square without the need to apply for permission under the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act (SOCPA) 2005",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Mark Thomas is generating a lot of paperwork due to the large number of demonstrations he has applied to do. This is a waste of valuable police time in order to process the SOCPA applications. It is also detrimental to the environment due to the large amount of paperwork generated by this process. By making it legal for Mark Thomas to demonstrate in parliament square the police will be able to concentrate on more important matters and the paperwork therefore the environmental impact will also be reduced.",
