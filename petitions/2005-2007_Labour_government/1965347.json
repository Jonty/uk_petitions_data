            "background": "Currently bus lane signing is confusing to drivers who have to read signs often containing several different prohibited time zones, check the current time, and then decide whether or not the prohibition is presently in force. Because of penalty cameras, or simply because they are unsure, drivers frequently decide not to use the lanes at any time \"just in case\", leading to inefficient road use. A system of informative \"traffic lights\" in advance of the lanes, rather than penalty cameras at the end, would inform drivers exactly what the status of any particular lane is at any particular time. Lanes would then be used by non-bus traffic when permitted, and the need for additional decision making removed from the driver. Penalties issued for improper usage, if necessary, would then be clear cut and thus fair.",
