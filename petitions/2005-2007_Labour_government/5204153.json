        "background": "I, like many others, am dismayed by the  new logo unveiled for the 2012 Olympics. I would be ashamed to be represented by this Logo. This petition suggests that we put a stop to this now, and arrange a competition to decide a replacement logo, a people's logo, which is supported by a majority of the people voting on a series of designs submitted to a qualified panel. This panel should produce a shortlist which would then be open for a public vote. The logo chosen would then be representative of the people of London and the UK and give us something we can unite behind. I plead with people to support this proposal to give us a logo we can be proud of.",
