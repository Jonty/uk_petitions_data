            "background": "1)Many companies illegally impose exorbitant fees for simple issues, one area where this is currently under scrutiny is bank charges, however the problem is widespread, e.g travel companies charge \u00a325 for typos in names.\nI propose the creation of a nominal 'simple admin fee' which would set the amount chargeable for an administrative task to a value equivalent to 1 hour at the minimum wage per company involved (max 4). Any company wishing to charge more for an admin task would have to indicate it in the contract as an 'extraordinary admin fee' and if challenged would need to justify it with a breakdown of hours spent by grades of people employed.\n\n2)'Tie in' is essentially a hidden form of penalty charge. It should be mandatory for companies to offer an exit fee/escape clause allowing a consumer to give 1 months notice of terminating any contract for the provision of a service. The termination fee would be limited to costs incurred",
