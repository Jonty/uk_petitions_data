Whilst we appreciate the great work the Prime Minister has done in this sphere since he came to power, we demand a binding promise to provide a minimum of 1700 hours each year. We believe this would be a fantastic legacy for the Prime Minister and a great service to his country.\n\nThe petition is not intended to be humorous and clearly highlights a gap in government policy, for a government intent on setting targets for the country, why do the 'powers that be' reject this petition that attempts to allow the people to set their own targets?",
