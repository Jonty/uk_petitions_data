            "background": "Lets have stations convenient for us, so we can just drive to a station with a large car park and get on the train without clogging up the town centres.\n\nEspecially at Sedgefield  (co Durham).\nThis is THE PRIME example. Park in Sedgefield, and Ride off to London.\nIt is not very convenient having to fight your way in and out of Durham or Darlington to catch a train.\n\nIt is time now to do a little something for the constituency of Sedgefield, and for environmentally friendly Sustainable Transport, especially using electrified railways.\n\nThere is room, near the A1(M)Jc 60 for a station with a very large car park. The nearby A1M has been well engineered with good connecting roads to all parts of co Durham, Hartlepool, Stockton or Middlesborough.\n\nAll trains to Newcastle will surely want to call here for many more passengers \u2013 to London, Birmingham, Manchester and even some Edinburgh trains etc.\n\nA Freight Terminal should also be built here, as Trucks will have easy access for the whole of Co Durham, There is plenty of room. A very large Car Park and a Bus/Coach terminal as well.",
