            "background": "The citizen advice bureau in Horsham is an integral part of the community and we have become more and more reliant to the services that are provided by the officials and volunteers, who direct our quarries and problems. \nAs mental health patients we have become reliant to the specialised services that the CAB in Horsham provides. We are able to talk to someone who understands the extra trials and tribulations we undergo as we try to reintegrate with the communities that we are much a part of. And the fact that our problems and queries were dealt quickly and solutions provided by staff who understands the patient\u2019s mental state.\nWe are losing this service please help us keep our very helpful team.\nThanks",
