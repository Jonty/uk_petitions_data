            "background": "Banks are set to announce record profits of more than \u00a340 Billion, but it is emerging that industry leaders believe that the existing profit margin is insufficient. The average profit per customer has risen by a staggering 83% since 1997.\n\nSeveral executives have gone on record to say that fee based banking is a fairer proposition, in contrast to the existing arrangement of fee charging.\n\nWe believe that any such charge is patently unfair, and is also a direct attack upon all customers regardless of income or financial status. The disabled, poor and sick will all suffer and find it hard to justify the additional expenditure of \u00a3120+ per year.\n\nIn addition, we are also of the opinion that this charge will be introduced as a direct response to an ever increasing number of customers, who have successfully recovered overdraft and credit card fees.",
