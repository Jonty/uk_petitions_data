            "background": "\u201cOutdoor pools are one of the few spaces in towns where freedom is combined with safety, precious for both children & adults.  Surely the preservation of outdoors pools should be a concern not for just local government but for central government too.  An outdoor pool revival would bring together government aims & commitments to make us all fitter & leaner, to achieve community inclusion and to reduce carbon emissions.  All this makes the continued reluctance of local councils to support outdoor pools seem unpardonably blinkered\u201d.  Extract from \u2018Lidos are back with a splash\u2019 By Harry Evans 08/2006 FT.com. Outdoor pools provide a completely different experience from the enclosed & clinical ambience of indoor pools, they promote community cohesion, the integration of young & old, rich & poor, give the youth a vital meeting place & all the opportunity to be outside enjoying the fresh air.  With global warming the demand for outdoor pools is going to increase, governments need to plan for the future & preserve our outdoor pools.",
