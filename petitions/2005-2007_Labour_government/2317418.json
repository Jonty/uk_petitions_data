I'm pretty sure if we boycott any manufacturer who installs these devices in their cars, it won't happen? It's down to you. There are already more cars being produced, per year, than are required. Vote with your feet, and don't buy! Lets keep older cars on the road, rather than trying to keep up with the neighbours? It's your choice, buy a new car and pay the taxes, or save money, keep your car longer and show the government that you aren't going to get ripped off like this?",
