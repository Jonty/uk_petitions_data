            "background": "Tul Bahadur Pun won the Victoria Cross for Valour, after he single handedly charged a Japanese position under heavy fire in 1944, he served in the British Army for over 18 years and yet the government states he has \"failed to demonstrate strong ties with the UK\".  He wishes to live in Britain as he suffers from chronic ill health and has to travel three hours by car and then a day being carried by two to three people in order reach the hospital for his medical care, which often he cannot fully afford and is forced to rely on family members to subsidise.  We the undersigned feel he should be allowed entry to and permanent residence in the UK.",
