If these large orgainisation that we put are trust in do nothing about this protest or to prevent further protess like this, then it will show the nation and the world the extent that the govenment, police and all organisation like these see black people and all other people of different nationalities as expendable.  \n\nPlease add your name, country your signing from to the list, to STAMP OUT RACISM, starting with here and hopefully with the rest of the world. \n\nThank you for your help and support.",
