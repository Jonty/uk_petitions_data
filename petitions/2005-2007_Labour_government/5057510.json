            "background": "All around the country, the safety of young families, the elderly, children and adults is being eroded by careless individuals who think of nothing but themselves. Roads are dangerous places for pedestrians and with increasing traffic everywhere even the pavements are no longer safe.\n\nI call upon parliament to enforce the right of the pedestrian to transit safely without having to avoid cyclists and parked vehicles on our footpaths. The existing laws should be used to prosecute those who fail to use the road and damage the footpaths by thoughtless and selfish acts.",
