That historic event finally ended a sad chapter of British history. In the spirit of National Reconciliation and Restoration we urge the Prime Minister, as a gesture of goodwill to declare and grant amnesty to all African and Caribbean immigrants living in the UK who have no legal papers. We also ask the Prime Minister to write off all remaining debts owed by African and Caribbean nations to Great Britain. To us this will be one of the greatest ways in which Britain can mark the bicentary. \n\u00a0 \u00a0",
