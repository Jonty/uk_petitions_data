            "background": "The fire on The Cutty Sark is both awful news and a wonderful opportunity.  She deserves to live again, and to take a proud place as one of our proud maritime nation's flagship Sail Training Vessels.  \n\nFunds both to renew her as a sailing vessel and to support and to maintain her would be a major help to teach the nation's youth teamwork, and to show Greta Britain in the regular tall Ships events worldwide.  Yes, we have The Malcolm Miller, the Winston Churchill and other smaller ships, but a fully rigged tea clipper would be an amazingly beautiful addition to the fleet",
