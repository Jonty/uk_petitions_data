She has always been a much loved and treasured member of the teaching profession, and should be honoured accordingly.\n\nIf the man who created Wallace and Gromit can receive a birthday list honour from the Queen, then Daisy Davies deserves at least a special day.\n\nEveryone to wear purple on this day, and to spray lavender mist wherever they go.\n\nSuggested date for this holiday: 9th December.\n\nAny money raised in doing so to be donated to a charity of the Prime Minister's choice.",
