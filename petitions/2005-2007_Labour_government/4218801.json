Today we have all (black and white) indirectly benefitted from the Slave Trade, so I believe an apology is not in the nations gift, for those who truly deserve the apology again, they are no longer with us.  Do we approach Italy (Rome) French (Normans) Dutch (Danes) Norway ( Vikings) for an apology or compensation, I think not.",
