            "background": "Haslar Hospital is much needed it takes 40 mins in good conditions to reach Q.A  longer at peak times. Portsmouth is 5mins across the harbour we used to have a chain ferry for cars  if that was reinstated or a ferry constucted to take a couple of ambulances Haslar could easiliy serve both Gosport and Portsmouth Q.A. Hospital is pushed to it's limits,don't be another BEECHING who ruined the railways I want to see HASLAR retained for the coming generations they are going to need it.PLEASE THINK.Our troops could do with a good Hospital My late husband John Wallace Dip Arch F.R.I.B.A.sent you numerous letters about retaining HASLAR with ideas to expand the site. there are so many of us in this area of the same frame of mind as myself we cant all be wrong. Try and be remembered for doing something RIGHT for a change.\nMRS BARBARA WALLACE",
