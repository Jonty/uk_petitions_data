It was determined (there is precedence - Harris v DPP) that a lock knife becomes a fixed bladed knife when the lock is engaged.\n\nIt seems very strange that a 3 inch locking pocket knife is now treated in the same regard as a fixed blade knife. They are not \"illegal\" as such, but you do have to provide a \"reasonable reason\" for having one in a public place. A non locking folder of 3\" is not treated so harshly. As it is a SAFETY decice, a lock is not making a small penknife a weapon in my opinion and it seems very unfair.",
