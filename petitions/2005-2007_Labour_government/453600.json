        "background": "As the owner of a small business I already pay more for my Business Rates than I would do for being a home owner. As I run a very small business I produce less waste than from the average residential address yet as a small business I pay more for my rates as well as having to pay someone for my rubbish removal. It is unfair for a small business that produces little waste to be expected to have to pay extra for their rubbish removal whilst at the same time a residential address can throw out as much waste as they like without having to pay more for it. Business rates should either be lowered or the cost of rubbish removal be incorporated into the cost (same as residential) or a type of \"means test\" be carried out and a charge levied accordingly.",
