        "background": "House pricing is so ridiculously high that is it forcing many people out of the areas they were born in because they cannot afford their own home. It is time to put a proper limit on the value of homes, not just some profiteering fantasy figure set by the home owner.\n\nMany are also now losing their homes because they can no longer afford to keep up with mortgage payments, and will find it difficult to be able to get credit in the future, make house prices sensible! Petition the PM",
