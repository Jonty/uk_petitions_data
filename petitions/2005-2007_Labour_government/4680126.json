            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are more tidal levels during any fixed period in The Solent than most coastal places making it, like the River Severn Estuary, an ideal place for major electricity generating tidal barrages. Perhaps a road could be built on an eastern barrage between Lepe and West Cowes, providing the long awaited fixed road link between the Isle of Wight and mainland Britain. The western barrage could carry a footpath / bridleway / cycleway which would allow the option of a second road or a rail link at a later date. Wind turbines could be built along the length of the barrages making full use of that clean energy source too.",
