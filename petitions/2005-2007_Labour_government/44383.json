They are, however, under funded, poorly supported and lacking in proper representation at a national level.  \n\nThey have the potential to do so much, but are suffering from years of neglect.  The government should recognise this and should also recognise that local government will not provide a solution to these problems while public library funding can ebused elsewhere.  \n\nThere should be proper funding for libraries at a national level, and a proper drive towards creating a truly modern service which can be of use to all.",
