        "background": "Staff in the Identity and Passport Service (IPS) work hard to deliver the government's key agendas.  The staff are consistently praised as world leaders in fraud detection & customer services.\n\nWith this backdrop it is extremely sad that the management of IPS decided on the 9th February 2007 to impose a pay settlement without agreement with the trade unions.\n\nThis pay settlement meant in real terms no pay rates actually increased within the organisation, with the  most experienced staff receiving just a one off non consolidated, non pensionable payment which in some cases will actually amount to less than 95p per day in people's pockets.\n\nClearly this decision has led to large levels of anger & resentment.\n\nIt is for this reason we are calling on the Prime Minister to re-open these negotiations to allow an agreed settlement to be reached, therefore reinstalling people's confidence in management and the wider government and making sure staff ultimately feel valued as public servants.",
