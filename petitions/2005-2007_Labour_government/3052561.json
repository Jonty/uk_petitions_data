People refuse as they can get everything they want in the exisiting Tesco. Then Tesco gradually reduce choices in the small store. Then they try again for the big store with many choices. People cave in at this point. Tesco are creating a monoculture, bad for shoppers and farmers too.\n\nSoon Great Britian will be a Great Big Tesco. Act now before its too late. \n\n\"Every Little Hurts\"",
