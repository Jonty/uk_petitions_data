            "background": "In this country we have left wing and right wing national newspapers but we do not have a right wing terrestrial TV news channel as a counterweight to the existing news channels such as the BBC which is seen as left wing by many people. In the interest of democracy in this country a right wing terrestrial TV news channel should be established so\nthe general public can compare the output of a right wing news channel with the output of the BBC which is left of centre. I have read recently\nthat a similar thing has been done in\nthe USA. I am making this petition because I was appaled by some of the BBC's News bulletins during the last General Election campaign.",
