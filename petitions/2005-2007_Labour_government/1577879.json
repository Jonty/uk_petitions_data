            "background": "The government and local councils are continuously squeezing the road user by increasing taxes and introducing tolls, reducing parking space in cities. \nAt the same time the privatised rail and road systems, especially in the north, are impossible to RELY on as you can a car. \nWhen you cannot rely on a service you will not switch methods. To the PM we'd like to say - please don't expect us to choose between getting to work on time and protecting the environment - public transport is not currently capable of providing what a car can do a LOT easier and more reliably. \"Its improving\" won't do - we live and lose (earnings, due to cancelled/overcrowded trains) here and now.",
