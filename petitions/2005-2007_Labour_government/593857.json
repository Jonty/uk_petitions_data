These decisions affect people in the immediate area and more notice should be taken of the LOCAL view rather that overall policy. I would like to see Parish Councillors invited to be present when planning decisions which affect their immediate soroundings and individual parishes. Too often Planning Committees make decisions solely on local policy without ever visiting the site of the proposed development.",
