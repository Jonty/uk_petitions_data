        "background": "We cannot sleep walk into an ID card system that will infringe our civil liberties or allow ourselves to be bullied into congestion charging and road pricing - The Government needs to look long and hard at its priorities and realise that while they may not be able to understand the hard fought for concept of civil liberties they must know that ID cards will not stop terrorism and road pricing will not stop congestion; there are however many more worthwhile and effective ways to spend this kind of money - including the right medication at the right time which would not only improve the quality of life of sufferers of serious conditions but would also help to free up carers to make a full contribution to the economy - a win win situation instead of the lose lose scenario of ID cards and Road Pricing.",
