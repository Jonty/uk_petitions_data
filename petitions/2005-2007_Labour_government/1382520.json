We are now to pay more and more \"Green Taxes\" with no assurance as to where the money is spent.\nLook at the road tax as an example, with over 80% of the monies raised not being invested in alternative methods of transport.\nI deeply distrust this and any other government with any further taxes which will inevitably be forced upon us.\nIt is time that governments are made accountable to the electorate by having independently auditted accounts to show where and how taxes are spent.\nThey should then be held to account by the courts.\nI am in total agreement that we need to be more environmentally aware, but regarding the relentless unaccountable taxes..\nEnough is Enough !!",
