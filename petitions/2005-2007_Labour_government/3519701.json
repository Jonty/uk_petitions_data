        "background": "As the countries motorways are monitered by surveilance cameras we feel these should be put to further use. Motorway speed limits are subject to being lowered according to driving conditions, accidents, roadworks etc.\nTo help congestion why not open up the speed limits on outlying motorways thereby allowing the built-up areas and cities to empty quicker. Many motorways, and by-passes would benefit the gridloocked areas if traffic flowed faster, the 70 mph limit, imposed decades ago to help with fuel consumption during the oil crisis is out dated and does nothing to help our congestion problem.\nA prime example: the motorway system around Glasgow, in particular A74(M) relatively empty compared to M6/M5 through West Midlands but still restricted to 70 mph but capable of safely conveying vehicles at over 100 mph and cutting journey times.",
