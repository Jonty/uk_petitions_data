            "background": "Currently only parcels sent during November and part of December were free to our troops on operational duty.  Now all parcels have to be paid for.   We think that all parcels should be free all year long to help keep our troops moral up and to also send them much needed supplies that they are unable to get whilst they are away.  \n\nMen and Women who are serving our country and putting their lives on the line deserve to have home comforts and essential supplies sent out to them without them worrying about the cost to their partners/families/friends/loved ones back at home.\n\nA possible suggestion is for a voucher system where 1-2 parcels a week/fortnight/month could be sent to each person on operational duty to allow the system to cope.\n\nPlease Mr Blair have a good hard think about it and show our troops that you care about them.",
