            "background": "Each year about five million dogs, cats, rabbits, rats, monkeys, and other animals die in lethal dose tests performed in the U.S alone, but this number grows around the world in other countries. During a lethal dose test, the expiremental substance is forced into the animals throats, or is pumped into their stomachs by a tube, sometimes causing death by stomach rupture or from the sheer bulk of the chemical dosage. Substances are mixed in lab chows, injected under the skin, into a vein, or into the lining of the abdomen, or forciblly inhaled through a gas mask.  According to statistics, 50\\% of these animals will die in this expirement 2 to 3 weeks later. \nThe horrible fact about these incidents is that they are unneccesarry as there exists cheaper, efficient and more realistic results that can be used instead of animals.",
