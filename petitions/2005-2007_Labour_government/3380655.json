            "background": "As a member of Birdline UK it saddens me the amount of birds that are bread and sold there as so many that need to be fostered and re-homed.You may say with all the other important issues why worry about a cockatiel or parrot? Take the cockatiel as a part of the parrot family closely linked to the cockatoo their intelligence can be the same as a young child, they are not good talkers in a language that we understand but they can still interact in their own way.But people breed them sell them and purchase them to be condemed to a life in a cage or to be neglected and end up in a safe house waiting to be re-homed.So lets stop breeding birds for profit and selling to unsuspecting customers.With the recent bird flue people have been seen letting there pets fly away to be eaten by our native birds again ignorance.Also the conditions in which birds are kept before sale why not visit your local retail outlets and check them out or private breeder",
