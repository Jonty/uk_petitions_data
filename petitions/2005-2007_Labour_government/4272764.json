            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Part 3 of the Disability Discrimination Act requires providers of goods, services and facilities to take reasonable steps to remove barriers to access by disabled people.  Many providers have taken such steps, but many others have not.  Unfortunately, the Act does not require providers to give details of any improvements they may have made. \n\nIn consequence, a disabled person seeking a specific service must study local advertisements or other sources of information and then prepare a list of providers of that service.  He must then make enquiries hoping to find one on the list whose services are accessible to someone suffering from his impairment.\n\nSuch enquiries can be time consuming, costly and potentially embarrassing and may well prove fruitless because so many provider\u2019s services remain inaccessible.\n\nIt is proposed that providers shall be required to publish information describing the accessibility of their services in such a manner that a person suffering from a particular impairment may determine, without visiting the premises concerned, whether those services are likely to be accessible to him or her.",
