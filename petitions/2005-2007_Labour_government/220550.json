            "background": "This ill thought out piece of legislation is far to broad and discriminates against all men.\nThe line that the law draws between conflict resolution and harassment is far too low. The act currently says that any two unwanted approaches constitute harassment. This is even the case where there has been no violence of any kind.\n\nAs the Author John Gray correctly points out, men and women really are different and think differently. A man will try harder to resolve a conflict peacefully, whereas a woman will not.\nThis is why generally speaking you will rarely hear of a woman being convicted for these types of offence.\nWith a man though the opposite is true.\n\nTherefore this piece of legislation is blatant discrimination against men. It should be amended and all issues in the conflict mental or otherwise should be taken inro account. \n\nIt would have been far more appropriate to have based this law on the work \"Women are from Venus Men are from Mars\" by the well reknown author John Gray.",
