            "background": "It was recognised 200 years ago that secret societies were subversive to the government and centres of sedition. Secret societies are the antithesis of what a free democracy is about. It is understood the freemasons have now developed into a cult which may use its secret membership to develop and promote its business interests to the detriment of non members. Secret membership makes it possible to take over business and property of non freemasons by a form of insider trading using fifth column tactics before the non freemasons become aware of what is happening.",
