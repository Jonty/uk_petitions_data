            "background": "Patricia Hewitt has presided over so many disastrous \"initiatives\" in the NHS, has introduced so many \"change programmes\" before the previous ones have had a chance to work, and then blames the tax- and NI-paying public for getting sick, blames the doctors for working to the contracts she introduced (before thinking them through) that the NHS is now on its knees. She must be removed before further damage is done. (And please dn't just give her another ministry, where she can do further untold damage).",
