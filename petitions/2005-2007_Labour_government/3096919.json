            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Instead of simply being handed out dole, if a person becomes out of work, they still get paid - much like jobseekers allowance. However now they will earn it by working for 8 hours a week in their field, doing what they have been trained to do.\n\nBusiness's will apply to accept placements, and provide a list of 'types' of people they can use.  For example, salesmen, production staff, drivers, admin, unskilled etc. \n\nThen when a person who is in that field,   becomes out of work - they get moved into to one of the Business's waiting for a placement.  All the business has to do is report back that the person is there working for them.\n\nAdvantages to this are:-\n\n* The person out of work is gaining experience, and getting an oppurtunity to show off their skills to business's.\n\n* They are not falling out of touch with current legislation and technology changes within their field.",
