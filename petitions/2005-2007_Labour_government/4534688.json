            "background": "I'm a 22 year old working professional and my basic car insurance is nearly one thousand pounds. All drivers should be treated equally, male and female. \nWe are all innocent until proven guilty and until we have an accident we should not have to pay 1000 pounds to get ourselves to work and back. \n\nAll males are NOT boy racers. We do not ALL speed and break the law. Insurance companies cannot stereotype us into 1 group.\n\nOnce we have an accident, lock us into a 2 year insurance deal with our insurers so they can charge a rate and get their money back.\n\nDiamond should not be allowed to OPENLY DISCRIMINATE against male drivers by offering cheaper insurance to females. They should charge males at the same rate.\n\nCan you see a car company stating \"White people, come to us for cheaper car insurance\"\n\nWe (young male drivers of Britain and Northern Ireland) didn't choose to be a male born in the last 25 years so why should we be punished for trying to drive.\n\nPeople of Britain I urge you to sign!",
