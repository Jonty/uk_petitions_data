        "background": "When the London Government Act 1963 was first being drawn up in the early 1960s it was stated in the Herbert Report that the that the \"northern part of the borough of Epsom and Ewell definitely forms part of Greater London and must be included\", Epsom and Ewell would ultimately be excluded from the area in its entirety.  However, Epsom and Ewell is now a commuter hot spot for those that work in and around London due to its excellent links into the London area, as well as many people already classing it as London, locals and Londoners alike and thus Epsom and Ewell  should be given its rightful place in Greater London.",
