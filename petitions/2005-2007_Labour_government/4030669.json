        "background": "The purpose of my petition is bringing to the Prime Minister's attention the horrible situation in Zimbabwe. In recent days the violence problem has escalated and for the next few days the world\u2019s media will be covering everything about it that they can. Unfortunately, within a week, this will all be forgotten about and people will go back to living their lives and Zimbabwe will be pushed to just a minor column every couple of weeks in the \u2018World\u2019 section of the newspaper. \nBy bringing this to the attention of Mr Blair I hope that he, and other world leaders will take this situation very seriosuly and act as soon as possible.",
