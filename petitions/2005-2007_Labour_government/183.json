        "background": "It now turns out that, while the media has been more focussed on the illegal war on Iraq, the government has been handing over power to Europe by dividing our nation into 5 cross-border regions.  Apparently, the Arc Manche Region was established on October 05 with Paris as its Capital, a Regional Assembly, a Secretariat and M. Alain le Vern was elected as its President on the 17th Oct 06.  \n\nIt seems that, during Germany's EU Presidency, starting in January 07,\ncartographers will begin to \"harmonise\" all \"spatial data\" such as place\nnames of areas, regions, localities, cities, suburbs, towns or\nsettlements etc.  A current EU directive proposes a database for an EU\nwide property tax via the Valuation Office Agency, to levy Council and\nInheritance Taxes.\n\nThe government was elected to run the country, and, no matter how badly I feel they have done it, I can accept that, but, they were not given a mandate to give power away to unelected European beaurocrats of the Common Market.",
