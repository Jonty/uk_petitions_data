            "background": "Few people, I think, have contributed to motor sport, as much as Murray Walker. He commentated on television all over the world. His passion about the sport, and his endless gaffes endeared him to the world.  He commentated for over 50 years before retiring from TV, with missing only a couple of races due to ill health. \nEven after retiring from commentating, he still works in the sport.\n\nI believe it is long overdue, that he should be Sir Murray Walker.",
