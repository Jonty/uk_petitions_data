            "background": "In the UK,although body piercing is increasingly popular,there are surprisingly few guidelines to ensure peoples safety. There is very little government information on safe piercing,and many piercing studios still use dangerous methods, like gun piercing,and give out bad aftercare information, without people knowing any better. I would like to see more information made acessable about piercing care and what should be expected from a studio, stricter laws on age, ID and what piercers are allowed to do (for example, keep gun piercing to a total minimum,and only allow for the earlobes). I would also like to see local authorities taking an interest in the body piercing and tattooing studios in their area and how they are run.",
