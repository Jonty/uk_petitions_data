        "background": "You are apparently four times more likely to have an accident when driving if you are using a mobile phone...........\n\nWell, it is surely much more dangerous to smoke while driving then?  If a cigarette fell on your lap you are near enough certain to crash, and what about all these people who flick the ash/cigarette out the window - won't the prospect of the backseat of your car going up in flames lead to an accident?\n\nI think so!\n\nThis is not a petition against smokers, it is merely a petition to get the government to wake up to reality, this is much more dangerous than using a silly phone.\n\nIf three points is good enough for mobile phone users its good enough for this!  It is an absolute joke that this is not law anyway - no smoking while driving!!!!!!!!!",
