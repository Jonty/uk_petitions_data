            "background": "Negotiations at the UN to adopt a possible moratorium on high-seas bottom trawling have been derailed by Iceland who have put the interests of their fishing fleets above other countries, the consensus of the marine scientific community and conservationists. \nNew scientific evidence shows that by 2048, most commercial fisheries are likely to have collapsed, but Iceland is persuing a 'business as usual' policy, which directly opposes the international community's attempt to move towards positive remedial action. A country whose population totals perhaps 300,000 has no right to dictate fisheries policy to the rest of the worlds 6 billion inhabitants.",
