            "background": "It is appalling that DEFRA have taken the decision to U-turn on its` original decision re Cage Bird Shows. This cannot be a welfare issue as both Racing pigeons and koi carp shows/sales will be permitted to continue. The prestigious National Cage Bird Show ran for over 50 years under constant veterinary supervision. Bird Sales/shows generate a responsible attitude towards all areas of the fancy and offer an unrivalled first-hand insight into all aspects of bird keeping. Furthermore being open to the public it puts the hobby under the spotlight and not push it underground.",
