            "background": "It is outrageous that MP\u2019s have created legislation which exempts them from the Freedom of information Act. This makes a mockery of democratic government and further soils the government in corruption. It is effectively \u201cone law for them and another law for us\u201d. This is disgusting and MUST be reversed. The alternative is that if the Freedom of Information Act does not apply to Parliament, then it should not apply to anyone, therefore, I suggest that the Freedom of Information Act must be abolished. The country ran perfectly well without a Freedom of Information Act and ever since it was introduced it has proven to be a negative and destructive force in society and MUST be abolished!",
