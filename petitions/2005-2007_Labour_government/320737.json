Get rid of these trusts, and that will generate a vast amount of money to be spent where it is meant to be, in the NHS. Similarly with the GP referral system. If a GP thinks a person needs hospital treatment, who are these bureaucrats who think differently?  A GP knows his patients better than some nameless panel.",
