            "background": "If a fixed tariff of approximately ten to fifteen pence per litre were added to fuel duty it would more than cover a basic 3rd party insurance policy and the cost of the tax disc for all motorists. This way everyone has to pay if they are driving a vehicle. It would also reduce all associated costs with respect to tax disc production & paperwork. Motorists could pay a reduced private premium to encompass fully comprehensive insurance if desired.",
