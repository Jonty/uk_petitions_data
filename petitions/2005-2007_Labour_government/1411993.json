            "background": "First, this does not mean cancelling the Games itself; it would still take place \u2013 just not in London. It means acknowledging and accepting that there are far more important issues for the British government and a focus for tax payer\u2019s money. Handing over the Games to Paris or elsewhere would create a saving for British tax payers and a lesson for those who so poorly costed the Games. Rather than us believing London and the UK would 'suffer' from the 'embarrassment' of handling back the Olympics, other Cities and Countries would recognise the British peoples sound judgement and, if not delayed, business acumen.",
