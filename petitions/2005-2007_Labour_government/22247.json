Indicators are not an optional extra\n2. Stay between the white lines on roundabouts and don't cross lanes\n3. Don't drive while tired\n4. Don't drive after consuming alcohol within the previous 12 hours\n5. Don't drive in the middle lane on Motorways... stick to the left\n6. Don't overtake if you will not pass the slower vehicle within a reasonably short time\n7. Turn your lights on the in the rain\n8. Learn the 2 second rule about spacing between vehicles\n9. Slow moving vehicles should periodically pull into lay-bys to allow faster moving traffic to pass to prevent risky overtaking manouvers\n\nWith a large number of elder drivers and drivers who have not passed a UK driving examination, it would be prudent to try to inform the public of some safety information and some ettiquete.",
