        "background": "being in higher education and in receipt of benefits i wanted help for my next course with child care for my youngest child, my partner also wants to do a full time course at the same college i am attending, but because either of us aren't single parents we cannot get any funding for child care at all from the college or benefits agency, even though we are trying to better our future,get off benefits and get jobs which with out the courses and help with child care we wont be able to, therefore will have to stay on benefits. we find this very unfair as i am sure other people in the same situation will no doubt find this unfair too.",
