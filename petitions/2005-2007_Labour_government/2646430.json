Despite  this, rail links between these two areas are non-existent. A rail journey between  Oxford and Ipswich, for instance, takes   over three hours. Re-opening this lost link would not be very expensive or involve major disruption to the existing network. Indeed re-opening the link between Oxford and Milton Keynes would require a comparatively minimal amount of work as much of the track still exists. Given the projected future growth in this area, such a rail link will be (and is currently) vital.",
