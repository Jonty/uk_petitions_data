            "background": "It is clear that the costings for the 2012 Olympics were so completely unrealistic that an extraordinary amount of extra funding will be required to meet them.\nThe Prime Minister should assure the Nation that these costs will not be met by the \"peoples lottery\" against the wishes of the people.  Furthermore there should be no direct or indirect taxation of citizens that will benefit only the area around London for these games.\nAll funding should be declared and accountable by the government.",
