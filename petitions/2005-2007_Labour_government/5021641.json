        "background": "Under 18s are the future of the country, but all we are doing is being government lapdogs and doing exactly as we are told with no choices of our own and no chance to voice our opinions. The government claim that they are helping us and giving everyone a say, but in truth, they are not. A Prime example is the fact under 18s are not legible for a vote. If a youth can demonstrate more knowledge and understanding of government policies and the democracy of a country than a fully legible 30 year old then why should the youth be restricted from a vote?",
