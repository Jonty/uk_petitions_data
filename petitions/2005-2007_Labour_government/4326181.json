        "action": "Introduce compulsary philosophy education into the national curriculum as part of secondary education",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I believe that philosophy is being neglected by the compulsary\n    educational system and is leading young people to become\n    confused and to have weak arguing skills. In addition it is my\n    belief that the religious education system as it is at the\n    moment is flawed in many aspects and has no clear objective, and leaves most atheist students very bored and mocking of religion. I\n    understand that these are seperate issues and I cannot truly\n    comment on the reasons for this but I strongly urge the\n    government to review this situation and to consider the\n    advantages of teaching philosophy as a priority over RE. I left\n    school 2 years ago and although my school had a fully qualified\n    philosophy teacher, we were only ever given eight\n    philosophy lessons, and were given many hundreds of R.E.\n    lessons by the same teacher. There are many reasons to\n    introduce philosophy into the national curriculum that I would\n    not be able to do justice within the 1000 character limit here; it needs discussion.",
