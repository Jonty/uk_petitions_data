            "background": "The current income tax system is incredibly complicated and very expensive to maintain. Its complexity encourages higher earners and their advisors fo find means of evading and avoiding tax. \n\nHiding money abroad in tax havens and using inefficient means to avoid tax holds back the UK economy and means that the low and middle income earners effectively subsidise high earners.\n\nA flat rate income tax would discourage tax avoidance, reduce the number of people required to administer the system and encourage people to keep income and capital in the UK.\n\nIt would also encourage people to work harder and be much easier for people to understand.",
