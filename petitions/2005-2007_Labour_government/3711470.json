            "background": "The recent increase in penalty for illegally using a mobile phone whilst driving seems to have had some effect on the commuters that I pass each day.  \nHowever it looks like it has had no affect whatsoever on the number of van and lorry drivers who use their phones.  \nThis law would make employers liable to a fine of \u00a31000 for any of their workers who are caught using their phones illegally whilst driving on company time.  \nHopefully it would make them think twice before breaking the law and annoying me.",
