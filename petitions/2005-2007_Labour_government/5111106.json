            "background": "The government is telling the public a) animals don't suffer b) there are no alternatives and c) we have a right to kill them. It's all lies. If the test doesn't kill them, they're killed afterwards. There are lots of alternatives. People can painlessly have some of their cells removed for research. You can use computer models to imitate diseases and help find cures. This is more reliable than animal testing because when you test something on an animal, all you find out is how to cure cancer in a dog. It doesn't always work on humans. People have got serious side-effects from drugs that were tested safe on animals. And even if the tests were reliable, nothing gives us the right to abuse animals. They never did anything to us. OK, so people think we are cleverer than animals, but we aren't. We can make technology. They can do better stuff than that. Monkeys swing through trees, we couldn't. We can't breathe underwater like fish. We can't remember back 60 years as good as an elephant. We aren't better than them, we are different. People used to think whites were better blacks. This is wrong, just like the belief that we're better than animals.\nI'm fed up of you lying to the public. Tell the truth.",
