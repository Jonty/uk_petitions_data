It is important to the welfare of the future of this planet that we are all citizens of THE WORLD because this is the only way in which we can evolve off the face of this planet and begin to explore living in peace and harmony with each other: the goal of ANY world religion. We need to wake up and ACTUALLY deal with the problems in the world that WE SHARE. It is a paralysis of our existence that year after year we fail to help our fellow human beings with loose talk and selfish government policy. Countries are behaving like spoilt infants, lashing out at each other without as much as a second thought. We want change, show us the change. We are capable of living happily together and well, give us the chance, show us the change.",
