I listen to rock music whilst outside with in-ear phones & even this gets drowned out!! This noise impacts on everyone under the flightpath. So, we have 1 to 5 people per flight inconveniencing thousands for their own selfish ends. I wonder what the ecological impact is, regardless of noise pollution?\nWho is so self important that their necessity to get from A - B as the multi kilo decibel crow flies, outweighs Londoner's rights to not be subjected to unecessary noise - especially when all other aspects of commercial/private noise pollution are zealously policed by Environmental Noise Officers.",
