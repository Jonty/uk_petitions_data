        "background": "In a recent news bulletin advertised on an Internet Radio Station that the US CRB & RIAA have decided to increase the royalties charged to these companies, that will push many into bankruptcy.\nIn effect shutting them down and depriving many UK & European listeners  from having the choice of listening to internet radio rather than the poor quality of FM broadcasts available at the moment. I petition the UK government to look into this matter and protect our choice.",
