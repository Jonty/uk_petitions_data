            "background": "Many student face the same problem: towards the end of the second month of a term, their loan is depleted and they are left with no money to support themselves. \n\nAt the moment, there is a gap of 3 months between loan payments. These gaps generally cover the three terms: \nOctober - December, January - March and April - June. \n\nMany full-time courses make it difficult to get a job to support living costs, and many courses have a timetable that is constantly subject to change; again making it incredibly difficult to get and maintain part-time work. As such the loan is often the sole means a student has to get by. \n\nBy allowing the student to choose to have an installment paid to them at the start of each month, in the worst case scenario a student will have less time to wait until they can afford to live again.",
