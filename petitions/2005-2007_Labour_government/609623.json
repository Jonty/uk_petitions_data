This is the demand of the Iraqi street, and the privatization of oil is a red line that may not be crossed.\u201d, and reports in the Independent (Future of Iraq: The spoils of war 7/1/07) that Iraq's oil is \u201cabout to be thrown open for large-scale exploitation by Western oil companies under a controversial law which is expected to come before the Iraqi parliament within days.\u201d we petition Tony Blair to keep his word, support the Iraqi people and ensure that Western corporations are not allowed to pressure the fragile Iraqi government to sign contracts to privatise Iraq\u2019s oil",
