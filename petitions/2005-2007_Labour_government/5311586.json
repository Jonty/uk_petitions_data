        "background": "The content of the Prime Minister's latest speech has caused many people to seriously question Mr Blair's commitment to a free press.\n\nIn order to clear the air, regarding this matter, it would be in order for the PM to clarify his remarks regarding this.\n\nThe petition motion is very clear and is in accordance with the principles of our representative democracy.\n\nSpeaking about the freedom of the press to comment, the PM recently said:\n\n\"The damage saps the country's confidence and self-belief; it undermines its assessment of itself, its institutions; and above all, it reduces our capacity to take the right decisions, in the right spirit for our future.'' \n\nDoes our current Prime Minister endorse these comments?  Or does he wish to state that he believes in the freedom of press comment?  If he does then he will, himself, support this petition and would wish to \"clarify\" his most recent remarks.\n\nWe await the Prime Minister's response.",
