            "background": "This petition has been created to persuade the government to maintain  current services offered by NAGTY (eg. Outreaches, Summer Schools, Forums) which are invaluable to member wellbeing. We would, if necessary, consider upholding this as extra-curricular rather than built in to mainstream G&T education, which is planned by NPGATE on a wider and localised scale in schools individually and which would consequentially see the redundancy of current types of services offered.",
