            "background": "DFID and other international development agencies that recognise that African poverty and climate change are inseparably linked, and that the first cannot be solved without dealing with the second. They acknowledge that climate change could have a devastating impact on Africa, wiping out all the benefits from the support provided by the world's richest nations to Africa.  There is a need for increasing support for  climate change mitigation at the African community level to help poor communities address the impact of climate change on their lives: for example by supporting small-scale renewable energy and energy efficient programmes, development of  early maturing and drought tolerant crop varieties through farmer led research,  tree planting/ awareness raising about the role of tropical forests in reducing global warming, improved use and management of natural resources, particularly conservation of soil and water through rangeland development and small-scale irrigation schemes, etc.",
