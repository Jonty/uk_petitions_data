To help us realise this goal we call upon the prime minister to actually commit to a Public Inquiry as a result of these petitions. Simple but binding requirements based on receiving more than 600,000 responses (1% of uk population) and no sizable counter petition existing should be enacted. We are not putting our time in to this so we can receive non-committal responses when the petitions close.",
