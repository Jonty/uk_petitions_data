        "background": "EMA is a divisive benefit which causes conflict between learners. For those not receiving EMA, there is no financial advantage to learning. Young people who would be advantaged by undertaking further education are being forced into low pay low skill jobs as pressure can be placed on them to earn rather than learn. By replacing EMA with a non means tested training allowance, all young adults will be treated equally and may learn financial independence. By signing this petition, you will draw attention to a well meant but ill conceived plan which has implications to FE establishments throughout Great Britain.",
