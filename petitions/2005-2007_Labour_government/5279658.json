        "background": "We would like the price of holidays to be regulated so that during school holidays the price remains the same throughout the year. This would in one stroke stop pupils being taken out of school for a cheaper holiday. ie A two week holiday to Spain in early June for a family of 4 is around \u00a31000 but in August it goes up 2.5 times to \u00a32500.\n\nMost low paid workers can not afford this high price. \nTo compensate for the increase the prices could be increased across the board to cover the reduction.\nThank you",
