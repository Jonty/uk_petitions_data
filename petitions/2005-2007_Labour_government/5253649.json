We believe it is yet another step in destroying / undermining traditional British values. We call upon you to take whatever steps you feel are appropriate to bring together other political parties, religions, family groups, the media and the general public to bring pressure to bear upon Sony. The aim is that Sony will withdraw the game.\nWe also hope that you will find some way of introducing legislation that will prevent this happening again.",
