        "action": "Ease traffic congestion by allowing experienced car licence holders to ride motorcycles governed to 50 mph.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Experienced car licence holders should be allowed to ride mopeds/motorcycles capable of speeds not exceeding 50mph without taking a motorcycle test. Current moped laws limit such drivers to 30 mph which means that they are not a viable form of transport to anyone who has to travel any distance or outside of urban areas. The ease of riding a moped at 50 mph without gears, simple break and acceleration operation coupled with the road sense gained as a car driver should eliminate the need for a full motorcycle licence. This would encourage and enable the car to be left at home in favour of a smaller, cheaper to run and more fuel efficient means of transport that would have less impact on the environment and ease road congestion. This would be of particular benefit in the more rural areas that do not have a comprehensive public transport system as an alternative to the car.",
