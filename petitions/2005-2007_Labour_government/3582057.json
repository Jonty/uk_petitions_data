            "background": "I request that a ban is put on the netting of wrecks & reef's in UK waters. These net's are usually set at times of the year when breeding fish either visit our water's to breed or in transit to breeding grounds. They are usually set on neapish tide's and can result in the fish being left or trapped in the net for a number of day's. Also, they are susceptible to being inadvertently left on the wreck or reef area causing year's of damage to the area's breeding stock's. This can be caused by large ship's riding over the marker buoys cutting through the line, which then causes the net to fall or flop over the wreck or reef but can happen from the poor maintenance and length of time the net is left out due to bad weather. These structure's are used by recreational angler's who manage the fish stock on the marks so as to not decimate it. The material's that the nets are made of mean that they are there for ten's of year's.",
