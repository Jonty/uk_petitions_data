Kristiana Malinova Valcheva, Nasya Stojcheva Nenova, Valentina Manolova Siropulo, Valya Georgieva Chervenyashka, Snezhanka Ivanova Dimitrova and Dr. Ashraf Ahmad Jum'a are being held and tortured for allegedly infecting hundreds of children with HIV. They have all been tortured and at least two of the women have been raped. This is a human rights outrage. Medical experts from the French co-discoverer of HIV to Oxford University state that these workers could not have infected these children and were only treating them.  Please do not allow these acts by the Libyan justice system by using what influence the British Government has with Libya to stop what will be an execution of innocent people due to fear and hatred of a disease.",
