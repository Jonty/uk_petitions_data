            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Removing State Pensions from Income Tax will ensure that workers who have made provisions for retirement are not penalised by what is in effect means testing.  At present people who have made no provision are better off with Pension credit, Council Tax Benefit etc than those whose income just takes them over the thresholds, and who have to pay for everything.  The present situation will not encourage people to save for retirement, and bigger burdens will be placed on the taxpayer in forthcoming decades.",
