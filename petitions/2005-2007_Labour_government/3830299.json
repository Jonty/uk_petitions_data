The packs will also bring an important focus to the issue of energy conservation, which, given the impact of global warming and carbon emission on the planet, should matter to all of us. The full pack has the support of 'Which?' magazine, which ONLY has the best interests of the consumer at heart.  Show your support for the H.I.P, and ignore those with a vested interest in maintaining the current 'status quo'.",
