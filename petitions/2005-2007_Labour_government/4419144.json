            "background": "Double Democracy. Half the human population is female yet in no democratic legislature anywhere are half the elected representatives women! On average men and women think, act/react and communicate differently but the feminine viewpoint is everywhere massively under-represented politically. As one gender can neither properly nor fully represent the other it is proposed that the double democracy system be adopted in all freely elected governments, where each voting \"area\" would return one woman and one man to their Parliament, Assemblies etc.. All voters to have two votes to be used either singly ~ for one candidate only or as a pair ~ for one female and one male candidate. two votes for one gender invalidates both votes. The United Kingdoms House of Lords is surely an ideal candidate for this double democracy system where each \"area\" is a field of expertise such as law, science, religion (all faiths), entrepreneurial skill, the armed forces and so on, rather than geographical regions.",
