            "background": "We would like to petition that landlords owning Houses in Multiple Occupation should be made - BY LAW - to ensure that soundproofing between adjoining properties is adequate and the Council should check BEFORE allowing the house to be in multiple occupation. The landlords should be made to be responsible for the disruption and noise levels caused by tenants in a house they own but do not live in. We also believe that the Landlords should be licensed regardless of how many people are living in the house \u2013 and checked on a regular basis by the Council - as a protection for the adjoining owners. From paperwork that we have read, no consideration is given AT ALL to the adjoining owners of HMOs. It is grossly unfair and should not be allowed to continue. Why should Landlords not be made to be more responsible for their properties and who lives in them? Why should we be forced out of our own homes?\nIAN DELVES and LINDA SILVERTHORNE",
