            "background": "joint and equal access for both fathers and mothers and equal say in the up bringing of children. no parents should be allowed to refuse access for a child to see the other parent. should there be prison sentence or heavy fines or tagging for parents who refuse access to children\n Both parents should pay equal parts to the financial cost of a child, which means the c.s.a claiming from all fathers and mothers, so when the child is with the mother the father pays 15% of his earnings and when child at the fathers  the mother pays 15% of her earning , this would be a fair system, where at minute the mother/father gets all the money and when the child stay with there father/mother he or she has to foot the cost for and child staying with him or her and at the child's mother,/fathers in other words he or she pays twice, depending which parent claims .c.s.a.\n\nThe government seems to only be bother about the money side of bringing up a child, there is so much more. should there be a contact agency for parents not living with the child to make sure the child has access .",
