        "action": "Remove the restrictions of grant elidgeability for micro power generation (eg PhotoVoltaic, wind and water) and heating (eg solar and ground source) and introduce a  registration system with a defined set of objectives and independent certificate of compliance for grants",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Current and past grants available for micro generation and solar heating have only applied to installations carried out by one of the few certified installers.  \n\nIn most cases the installation costs of a system are far greater than any available grant.\n\nIntroducing a set of objectives that need to be met by anyone installing one of these systems followed by inspection and certification would allow smaller independent suppliers, DIYers and Self Builders to make advantage of available grants, increase competition and foster an increase in the use of these systems to reduce the demand on centralised \"dirty\" non renewable energy sources.\n\nAnyone wishing to take advantage of a grant would need to register their interest in the grant and be given the criteria that they need to meet.  \n\nAfter installation an independent inspector would visit site and sign off the work to approve the grant which would then be paid.\n\nThis could be an extension of the local planning / building inspector's remit.",
