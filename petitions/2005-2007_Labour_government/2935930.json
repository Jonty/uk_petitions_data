            "background": "UK and EU working on pollution. However we are not going to make much impact on our own. Need to look at the big picture.\n\nTo make a quick difference we in the EU need to say we will not buy imported products if they are made in a factory that damages the environment.\n\nROHS (restriction on hazardous substances) recently introduced has soon resulted in a change - if UK/EU companies have standards to comply with why do we accept cheap imports made without these standards?.\n\nAll imports should have to have the same high levels of control that producers in the EU have. One level playing field - could be done fairly quickly by each industry focusing on the real polluters as a first step.\n\nWe have addressed the goods coming into the EU in that they have to be re-cycled and must be safe BUT APPEAR TO HAVE IGNORED THE IMPACT WE COULD HAVE ON THE PRODUCTION OF THESE GOODS and ther impact on the environment at the factory gate. This is a world problem needing more than a local response.",
