            "background": "That Hereditary and Spiritual Lords should have 20% of the Upper House in recognition of their outstanding service to the UK. \nRemaining 80% of seats should be elected by proportional representation and serve a term of 7years holding the title of Senator rather than Lord.\nGenral Elections to the Lower House should be every 5 years and not called by the Prime Minister and the Upper House election for Senators should be every 7 years. If organised correctly it would be only every 35 years that the electorate would vote for both Houses.\nAlso, the Royal Prerogative should be abolished and that the Prime Minister and Cabinet would be answeable to both Houses and that the valuable work of Parliamentary Committees should be enhanced and expanded.",
