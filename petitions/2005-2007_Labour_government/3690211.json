            "background": "We urge the Government and the Prime Minister to review the recent pay award announcement, which, in real terms, represents a pay cut for all nurses in view of the present rate of inflation. We ask that it is recognised that staff morale has never been at a lower ebb with many staff already working many hours unpaid overtime to care for patients, whilst also worrying about the detrimental impact of further reduncancies on patient care. We ask that in recognition of the services provided we are offered a fair and equitable pay award.",
