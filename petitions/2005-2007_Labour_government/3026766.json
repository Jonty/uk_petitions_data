This extreme example of political correctness, aswell as the existence of faith schools only manages to increase segregation and racial divisions in this country. The major factor in the rise of far-right extremism is due to the people's frustration with the limits on their freedom of speech that political \"correctness\" imposes on them.",

            "background": "Political correctness is a backwards theory encouraged by the government to take attention away from the fact that they aren't doing anything to significantly stop racism and discrimination in this country. The frustration of the people at political correctness has increased the numbers in far-right parties such as the BNP, and the existence of faith schools only further increases racial divisions. This is a call to stop the government being so oversensitive around issues which shouldn't be considered offensive at all, and instead actually doing something significant to combat real cases of racism and discrimination.",
