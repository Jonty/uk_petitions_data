        "background": "If the minimum legal age to start driving a car was 20 years old, congestion would immediately be cut by a certain percentage, and the roads would be safer as a result, because young people would have had the chance to grow up a little and calm down ... before taking to the road. There would also, as a result of this proposed change, be less accidents.",
