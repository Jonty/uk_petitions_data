We the undersigned consider this to be culturally and morally wrong and ask the Prime Minister to use his influence to ask New Line to reconsider their decision. Given that JRR Tolkein was a British citizen and the Hobbit was written in this country we consider the story to be of major cultural significance to the country and that given that Peter Jackson did such a fine job directing the films of the Lord of the Rings trilogy he should be entrusted with the new movie.",
