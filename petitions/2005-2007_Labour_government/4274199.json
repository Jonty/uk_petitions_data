            "background": "Royal Mail are now saying it is acceptable for 1st class mail to be delivered in 4 days instead of the 1-2 days it advertises in Post Offices and online. It has recently reviewed it's charges for postal items, making it more expensive to send the majority of items 1st class, and at the same time it's quality of service has dropped. In most cases, RM is still the cheapest form of postal service, but the false advertising is letting us down. It has a responsibility to both consumers and businesses to meet the timescales laid down, to justify th price increases.",
