        "background": "Many people have to live their daily lives around the fixtures at local stadiums because these venues are in heavily populated areas.\n\nEvery home event turns into a nightmare for the local residents who are forced to endure as much as 2 hours of traffic chaos before and after events for miles around the stadium due to supporters parking everywhere, not to mention any misbehaviour from supporters.\n\nBan all further development of new or existing stadiums within a 3 mile area of residential areas and ensure that all new developments have a fully developed public transport plan and enough parking capability to ensure the needs of thier supporters without disrupting the residents.",
