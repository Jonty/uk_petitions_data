            "background": "Given that the Prime Minister has been lecturing the British public about the dangers of Global Warming and telling us we need to reduce consumption, it is hypocritical in the extreme for him to commission a fleet of luxury wide-bodied 777 jets to ferry him around the world.\n\nThe Prime Minister should be leading by example and reducing the amount of time he spends flying or being chauffeured around in a convoy of Jaguars, Range Rovers and motorcycle outriders. If it is essential for him to fly, then this can be achieved with a minimal environmental impact overall by using existing chartered flights. A dedicated jet for the Prime Minister and his entourage is simply conspicuous consumption on a massive scale in terms of environmental impact and cost to the taxpayer and will do nothing to encourage the rest of the British population to reduce their own carbon footprint.",
