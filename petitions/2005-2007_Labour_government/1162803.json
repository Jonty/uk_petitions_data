            "background": "The number of overweight and obese people is rising and over 50% of the UK population are now overweight or obese. We are being told by the media and government to eat more fruit and veg, yet the cost of unhealthy foods such as 'ready meals', biscuits and crisps is much lower than healthy alternatives. People who consume these products to excess are more likely to become obese and therefore increase the demands for heath care, having a greater risk of diabetes and heart disease, and increases the number of working days lost due to illness, much the same way as smoking does. Tobacco is taxed to discourage smoking and to pay the cost of its health consequences. Introducing taxation on 'junk foods' may persuade people to eat healthily and the revenue generated will allow the cost of healthy foods and access to gym facilities to be met in part by government subsidisation.",
