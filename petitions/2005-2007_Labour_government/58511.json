            "background": "Many people currently believe that the current drugs classification system is poorly arranged. Drugs with little addiction and overdose potential such as magic mushrooms and LSD are in the highest class (Class A), while speed, which has a high overdose and addiction potential is in a lower class (Class B). For example, supplying magic mushrooms can carry a life prison sentence and an unlimited fine. Such a crime should not be on par with more serious crimes such as murder, rape and child molestation, which also carry life in prison and an unlimited fine.",
