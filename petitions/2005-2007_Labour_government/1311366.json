        "background": "I wish to petition the Prime Minister to establish education vouchers for all children between the ages of 5 - 18 years. This would, I believe, enable all parents to be able to send their children to a school of their choice which would be directly accountable to them as consumers. Private schools perform better and give children a better start in life. All children should have the amount the government currently spends per head in the form of a voucher. FREE PRIVATE EDUCATION FOR ALL!",
