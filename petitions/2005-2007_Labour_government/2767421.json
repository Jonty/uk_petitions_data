If this country is to have a world-class higher education system, it must be funded properly and, barring massive tax increases, the only way to do this is via tuition fees.\n\nThe current maximum of \u00a33000 is ridiculous. Universities should be allowed to set higher maximum fees, but the Government should then subsidise those students who cannot afford to pay. (A sliding scale would be appropriate here.)",
