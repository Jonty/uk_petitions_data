He has done absolutely nothing for our country (Great Britain), apart from putting us under greater threat of random terorist attacks and endagering the already fragile relationships with major Eastern countries.  Mr Blair has stated his intention to try to build working relationships with Muslim countries, and I cannot see this as helping.",
