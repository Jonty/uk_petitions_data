        "background": "I drive a company car and as of July 1st I won't be allowed to smoke in it. Now, if I was driving say 130 miles it would normally take me about 2 hours, once the ban comes in it will take around 3 hours as I would have to keep stopping for a cigarette. My plan is to substitute the cigarettes with Pepperami Firesticks because I like them but they're not cheap! At \u00a32.18 for a pack of 5 it will cost me around \u00a38.72 per day for 20 firesticks instead of under \u00a36 for 20 cigarettes. Granted they are \u00a33 for 2 packs of 5 in Morrisons at the moment which works out at roughly the same as the cigarettes but they're not always this price! I propose we have tax relief on Pepperami Firesticks for a minimum period of 12 months to help me and others kick both habits. No doubt there will be other taxes introduced anyway to make up the shortfall in taxes. What do you think Tony?",
