            "background": "I think its about time so called \"care/nursing home\" standards were looked into in detail with unanounced regular inspections so that the fundamentals of care can be corrected because in a lot of cases even basic things which are a requirement of life itself are innadequate. I see food on a daily basis which WOULD NOT BE TOLERATED IN PRISON which is given to poor old helpless vulnerable people who are living in so called \"care/nursing\" homes. Why is it that old people are given food in so called \"care/nursing\" homes that would not be tolerated by younger people or people not in the same \"category\". People in prisons and secure units are getting better food than vulnerable old people in \"care/nursing \" homes. Why hasnt standards of nutrition in \"care/nursing\" homes not been made a \"cause\" for improvement like it has been in schools.",
