            "background": "I am a student studying a-levels. Contradictory to common views, this is a long and hard process. After doing revision, homework and extra reading during a private study session I thought I deserved a brake. However I was faced with an empty vending machine. Further work was almost impossible to complete on an empty stomach and low sugar levels.\n\nI understand this move is popular for lower schools, and in part, i agree with that. But to remove sugar from vending machines within a 6th form only block is outrageous. I am not trusted to make a decision about my health at the age of 17. I am fit and healthy and I attend my local gym. Why should I be denied the right to a \"treat\" after hard work. After all most revision plans tell you to have a sugary snack to help you continue studying.",
