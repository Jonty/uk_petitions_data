        "background": "Debt Collection Agencies are increasingly targeting people for debts that they do not owe or dispute, which calls into question their tracing and data sharing procedures. Little or nothing can be done to deter the harrassment caused by them telephoning day and night, and a constant stream of pointless letters. People avoiding debt leave a trail of misinformation, something which DCA's don't seem to understand. To respond to a letter or call seems to be an automatic admission, whether or not the debt is actually owed. There has to be a better way to protect people from the tactics employed by these Companies, while correctly identifying evasive debtors.",
