Little or nothing can be done to deter the harrassment caused by them telephoning day and night, and a constant stream of pointless letters. People avoiding debt leave a trail of misinformation, something which DCA's don't seem to understand. To respond to a letter or call seems to be an automatic admission, whether or not the debt is actually owed. There has to be a better way to protect people from the tactics employed by these Companies, while correctly identifying evasive debtors.",
