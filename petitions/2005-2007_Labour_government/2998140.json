            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "One of the barriers to the Government's Identity Card system is the cost of the cards, which is expected to be passed on to citizens - creating another universal poll tax. At the same time, banks are struggling with threats to the security of credit/debit cards. By combining the ID card with a credit or debit card and auctioning the licence to issue such cards to the highest bidding bank or bank consortium, the cost to the Govt and citizen could be eliminated. The benefit to the citizen would be free ID cards.  Govt would benefit from greater acceptance of ID cards and the elimiation of a major barrier to their introduction. The benefit to the successful winning banks would be to have a huge guaranteed card user base, plus an unmatchable degree of security.",
