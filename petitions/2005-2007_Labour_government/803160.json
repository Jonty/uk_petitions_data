Given the inconsistant and dangerous changes made on the A628 Woodhead Road over the Pennines, I suggest that changes to the law should not be placed in the hands of such un-elected people. I have seen a significant increase in journey times, together with far more people crossing these lines (including police cars). Motorcycles should feel most penalised.",
