The end result is a country whose social infrastructure is falling apart at the seams due to such ineffective Government. Therefore, I propose the introduction of a law whereby cabinet members of such a Government who fail to keep their promises to the British People, are banned for a minimum of ten years from seeking re-election to the house of commons or becoming a peer in the house of lords.",
