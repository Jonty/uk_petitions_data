        "background": "Woman who have children at school should participate in a small amount of voluntary work, such as helping in school, old peoples home etc.\nMen who do not have any responsibilities for children should put something back into the community and do various work.\nThere should be an organisation set up alongside the benefits agency that seeks positions for people who are claiming benefits.  People work extremely hard in this country and pay their way so it is only fair that people that are in receipt of benefits give something back and enhance the community.  This may also lead to them learning a new skill, being interested in a certain career.  The individual who is working will also feel more worthy as they will be doing something for their benefits and in return everybody will benefit.",
