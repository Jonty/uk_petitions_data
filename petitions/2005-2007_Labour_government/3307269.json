        "action": "replace the air travel levy as soon as possible with carbon trading by airlines, and in a form that recognises the greater environmental damage done by CO2 emissions at high altitude.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A charge of \u00a310 for a shorthaul flight however short and \u00a340 for a longhaul flight however long is a very blunt instrument and clearly not directly related to the environmental damage caused. The Norwegian approach is preferable, taxing seats that take off empty as well as full. It is aeroplane flights that cause the damage, not individual passengers' flights, and airlines should pay the tax. If they wish to compete in the market, they will not pass on an undue proportion of any tax to the users of efficient flights, i.e. those of budget airlines, and shuttle operations used mainly by business travellers. I do not consider that revenue neutrality is an issue here, given the fuel tax and VAT concessions enjoyed by airlines.",
