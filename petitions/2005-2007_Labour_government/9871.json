            "background": "High street banks on occassion automatically close overdrafts at a specified time without consulting the financial implications with the consumer, or informing them that it's going to be closed whether in credit or not. If the account is in debit, the customer is in a very bleak position. Even if accounts are reviewed and the customer has a reliable income, an extension may still be denied. This is unfair and unjust, and should be rectified as soon as possible. \nLegislation could be introduced by the Government which offers protection to the customer if such a situation occurs, resulting in an automatic extension of an overdraft's duration by default. Certain numbers of people are falling into this trap, and they are defenceless against the onslaught of staggering amounts of accrued interest gathering on a debt-ridden account that banks will not deliberately close, as it generates unjust amounts of revenue for them.\n\nSomething must be done to stop this and protect the publics trust.",
