        "background": "The present system calls for clocks to go back at the end of October and forward again at the end of March.\nMy proposal is that this should occur instead a month later to go back, i.e. end of November, and forward again a month earlier, i.e. end of February. This would obviously result in the clock changes being confined to a three month period only rather than the current five thus extending British Summertime a further two months.",
