            "background": "Road pricing is unfair and will not prevent the wealthy from being able to use their cars in an irresponsible way polluting our towns and contributing to climate change.\nWe could have variable taxation. Three bands could be created. The fuel at the pump would be priced with full tax (band C), but motorists would get tax credits with a smart card. They could purchase say 500litres in band A (very little tax); 500litres in band B and the rest at full price.\nThis would encourage responsible use of the car, enable the poor and rural dwellers to make use of the roads and tax heavily the heavy users. This tax would influence behaviour because people would be less likely to use up their 'fuel tax credits' on short journeys. This would be a fair eco-tax because the biggest polluters would pay most.\nOur privacy and civil liberties would be protected.",
