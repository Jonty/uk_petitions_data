Goverment taxes have gone above the rate of inflation  and yet you expect them to take a pay cut where is the logic in this .You have awarded the service people a pay rise of between 3.3%and 9.2% are they not as important as the service personal .What will be the pay rise for the MPS i bet this wont be staggered and will be above inflation .They are life savers just the same  pay them the same stop making excuses.",
