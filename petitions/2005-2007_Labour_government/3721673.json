It diverts funds from more worthy and liberating activities in schools, and is a cause of anxiety among pupils, parents and teachers.Furthermore, the measurement of ability is not based on any \"gold standard\", so year on year comparisons are meaningless.SAT tests or \"son of SAT\", where pupils are tested \"when they are ready\" is waste of energy, time and money for everyone involved.Scotland and Wales seem far mor enlightened!",
