        "background": "A bait car is a car used by the police to capture car thieves. The vehicles are modified with features including GPS tracking, hidden cameras and the ability to remotely disable the engine and lock the doors.\n\nIt is not entrapment, since suspects are not persuaded to steal the vehicle by any means other than its availability and their own motivation.\n\nWidespread advertising of the system should make potential offenders think twice before acting.  This system has had success in other countries, where convictions are easy because the video evidence means that offenders plead guilty.\n\nI also propose bait houses, sheds and garages, motorcycles, mobile phones, cycles etc along similar lines.\n\nThis makes it much easier to identify and remove criminals from our society.  After all, we use surveillance technology to monitor innocent people every day, so why wouldn't you use this technology to catch criminals?",
