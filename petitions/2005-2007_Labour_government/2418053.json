        "action": "Establish a dedicated Educational Ombudsman to enable parents the opportunity to have an independent review of school issues.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "As schools now have more autonomy, parents concerns tend to get dismissed as Governing Bodies, LEA, and the DfES generally refer concerns back to the school. After April 2007 Ofsted will start to look into parental concerns, but only after all avenues within the education system have been exhausted, by which time, your son/daughter may have left the school. We have the Financial Ombudsman Service for bank concerns, but with education there is no dedicated Ombudsman, and therefore issues such as bullying, special needs, poor teaching, admissions, performance, exclusions, support, homework, exams, consistency, management, etc. cannot be dealt with, making the life of students miserable, resulting in poor exams results. Schools are generally very defensive when receiving complaints, tending to blame the students. In order to realise an educational system where Every Child does matter, please sign this petition for a dedicated Educational Ombudsman to secure our children\u2019s future.",
