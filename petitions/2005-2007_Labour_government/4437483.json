            "background": "Rosslynlee hospital in midlothian is a C class listed building, it has great historical and architectural importance to the local community.\n\nThe proposal is to demolish the hospital, and move the patients to a new PFI hospital to be built in near by bonnyrigg, giving the grounds of Rosslynlee hospital and Loanhead hospital to property developers in part exchange for building the new hospital, PFIs cost 5 times more to build than Non-pfi hospitals, a cost which can only  be recovered by diverting revenue from clinical services and staffing affecting patient care\n\nRosslynlee hospital currently has 108 beds dedicated to mentally ill patients the new facility will only have 48 significantly less than the royal college of psychiatrists' recommendations. It should also be noted many of these patients have been in-patients of rosslynlee for many years and their families are worried about how they will cope with the transfer or care in the community.",
