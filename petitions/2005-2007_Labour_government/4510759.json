            "background": "I believe in todays currant socity that many couple's are facing the prospect of life without children as their partners have had a reversal.  I propose that as the vasectomy is available on the NHS - the reversal should also be available.  I am 29 and my fiance is 41 - we are desperate for another baby but cannot afford the \u00a34000 fees for a reversal.  I am not suggesting that this should be made an easy option but the NHS needs to get into the 21st centuary.  I need your support - please sign!!!!!",
