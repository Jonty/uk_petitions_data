            "background": "We cannot allow the relocation of the Royal Signals training camp from Blandford, Dorset, to either the Midlands or Wales. The community of Blandford Forum and its surrounding area would be devestated from the loss of jobs, and the income the camp provides in the means of using the towns shops, restaurants and pubs. \nMoving the army camp would then mean building a new camp elsewhere in the country, costing millions and removing precious greenery that we have, why not leave it just where it is?",
