            "background": "We are beginning to move in the right direction with climate change, but under the current party political system it is hard for the government to feel able to pursue unpopular short-term policies for long-term positive benefits. This petition is to prove that as a nation we are prepared to make sacrifices in our individual lifestyles, as in a time of war, both to help combat climate change and to become a true leader to the rest of the world in the field of climate change technology. The undersigned want the goverment to set in motion definite plans, actions, and laws to achieve a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions of 60% below 1990 levels by 2020, and non-renewable fossil fuels to only comprise 30% of our energy provision by 2020. We are prepared to make personal sacrifices in our lifestyles for such a change, and implore the government to be brave enough to accept the will of the people in this matter, and to do everything within its power to accomplish the reduction in greenhouse gas emissions and decrease the use of non-renewables.  This is a war for our children's future, and one that we as a nation are both prepared and eager to fight.",
