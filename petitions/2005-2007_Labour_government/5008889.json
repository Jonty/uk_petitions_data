            "background": "The Government has deemed that since 2005 the TB vaccination is no longer to be given to all British born children. The vaccination is to be used only for children originating from countries where TB is high. Contrary to belief TB is on the rise. Recently on GMTV (Monday 5th March) a young lady was giving an interview after having contracted TB, she has never been abroad and had never knowingly come into contact with anyone carrying TB, the symptons are such that it would appear the carrier has a chesty cough. Now she is to have one of her lungs surgically removed as a consequence. The influx of migrants from these countries is such that our unprotected children, and ourselves are now at risk. This is a vaccination that our children are entitled to and should be receiving before there is an epidemic. We are told that as responsible parents we should vaccinate our children against childhood diseases. So how irresponsible is it to not vaccinate against Tuberculosis which is a killer.",
