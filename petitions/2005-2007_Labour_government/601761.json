        "background": "In some Tesco supermarket car-parks, all cars are photographed as they enter, and again when they leave.  The date & time at which each photograph is taken is recorded, and if the car has exceeded the free parking allowance, Tesco's computer sends a file of registration numbers to the DVLA.  The DVLA computer adds the name & address related to each registration, and sends the file back.  Tesco then post a bill to the person who has over-stayed.  I understand that the DVLA needs to know who owns a car, but this information is private, and should not be used for commercial purposes.",
