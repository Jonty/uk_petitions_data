        "action": "Make all local councils abolish tree preservation orders on trees that are located within 9 metres of a private dwelling, thereby causing subsidence to said properties.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I bought my house in 2005, and one of the councils conditions was that I could not / would not cut down or prune any trees located within my boundaries, this dispite having 2 trees in my boundaries, 1 of which is causing subsidence. My neighbor also has 2 trees in his garden and this makes my garden and home very dark, even in bright sunshine and the branches are causing problems with both of our phone lines. When we complain to the local council, thay say it is a BT problem, yet BT say it is a council problem, so we just have problems all the time.\nI am willing to pay to have the trees removed and also to pay for replacement trees to be planted in a more suitable location, ie; a park or local woodlands.\nThank you,\nWilliam Geddes Strachan",
