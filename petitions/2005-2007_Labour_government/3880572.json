            "background": "I feel that a posthumous Knighthood should be awarded to the late Bill Shankly, former manager of Liverpool FC.\n\n\"Shanks\" was responsible for LFC being promoted in 1962 to the old First Division and was the founding stone of all of LFC's many successes since their election to the League's top Division, where they have remained ever since.\n\nSuch was his presence at Anfield, that his famous \"Boot Room\" still exists today, where he would outline his team and formations to his managerial successor, the late Bob Paisley, who went on to become the greatest English club manager ever and who kept the tradition of the Boot Room going.\n\n\"Shanks\" is still greatly admired by many football fans and was the epitomy of Liverpool FC - The Legend lives on.  \n\nAnd it is with the greatest respect that I ask the British Government to bestow a long overdue posthumous Knighthood on Bill Shankly - a man who made a phoenix rise from the ashes and whose legend drove that phoenix to conquer Europe five times, as well as the capture of many, many domestic trophies.\n\nI beseech you on behalf of many thousands of Liverpool FC supporters at home and abroad to make the proclaimation that Bill Shankly becomes \"Sir Bill Shankly.\"",
