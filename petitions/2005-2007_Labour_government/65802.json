Because of this we always have to pay higher premiums which isnt fair cos me and my wife have never been in debt never owned anything to anyone and we are constantly struggling !!!!! my daughter cant have the stuff she needs due to big businesses taking our money!!! They have to be a way of proofing easily that it was the past owners!!! It really isnt fair!",
