It seems clear that for many crime is chosen because it is all that they are intellectually capable of, modern life is just too difficult for them to understand. Try getting an eleven year old to run a household and you will soon find them \"turning to crime\" not because they are morally lacking, but because they do not understand how \"legal\" society works.",
