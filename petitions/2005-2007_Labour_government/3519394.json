            "background": "The Olympics has sent London Public Transport Fares spiralling out of control.  It now costs \u00a32 for a single bus journey and still many day travelcards remained over \u00a35 each.  Congestion ensures you can't get anywhere at busy times and there's never a seat so we shouldn't pay so much.  One fare increase = fair enough, but don't keep doing it!!! It's becoming extortionate!!! Plus oysters cannot be used on some national rail services!!! ALL LONDONERS, SIGN THE PETITION!!",
