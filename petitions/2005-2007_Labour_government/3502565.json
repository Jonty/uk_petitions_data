            "background": "While the UK goverment debates how many billions of pounds to spend creating the Olympic games site, more hospitals are refusing treatment and operations as they have neither cash nor staff and are seriously underfunded.  In Eire the health system is amazing, funded by the Irish Lottery. In Eire, no-one has to wait long for operations or treatment and there are no superbugs as hospitals are clean. We demand that the lottery profits do not go to lost causes and 'fat cats' but to fund the NHS in the UK.",
