            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Over recent years, Seagulls have become more and more of a problem in towns and cities across the country, taking foods straight out of peoples hands, stealing food from tables,constant noise from early morning and ripping bin bags apart.Gulls never used to be so big, so vicious, so far inland, and in such numbers. In nature every creature has a predator to control it but seagulls do not have any and in some areas they have become a definite nuisance.It is something which must be dealt with and the only solution is to cull them annually.Councils should make it an offence for people to feed or to leave scraps of food in Public areas with mandatory fines in place.Littering has always been an offence but by coupling feeding and littering the public is getting the message.Seagulls spark a flurry of complaints every year to Councils about noise, mess and their aggressive behaviour but they are unable to act due to the current Laws and I think its time Councils were given the power to take action.",
