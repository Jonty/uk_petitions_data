        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The personal capability assessment should be extended in all cases where a person wishes to claim incapacity benefit to include a focus on retraining where a claimant is no longer able to carry out his/her normal work. People who are on long term sickness benefits (12 months +) and or unemployment benefit (6 months +), excluding Severe Disablement Allowance, and who also refuse the opportunity of retraining for appropriate alternative employment, or who refuse to engage in some form of voluntary or community work, should be barred from applying for or renewing a TV licence.",
