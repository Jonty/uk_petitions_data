        "background": "To stop creating more world-wide fear aka \"terror\" by interfering with developing nations and assuming everyone is out to get \"us\". To find a way to better communicate with these nations and work with them rather than threaten and dictate terms to them according to what suits \"us\".\nTo not hold an entire country accountable for the actions of a small minority. \nTo use covert intelligence operations where absolutely necessary and avoid \"big brother\" warfare where it is not justified unless irrefutable proof of imminent danger to our own nation or to that of one of our allies can be proven beyond any doubt beforehand.\nTo stop racially/religiously profiling our own citizens, therefor creating more fear within communities aka \"Terror\".\nTo stop feeding \"Terror\" with knee jerk reactions soley based on \"fear\" of what \"could\" happen and \"what ifs\".",
