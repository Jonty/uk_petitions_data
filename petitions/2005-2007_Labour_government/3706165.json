The victims lives are sometimes ruined for the rest of their life.\n\nA significant number of sex offenders re-commit sexual offences. The current sentences that are handed out are too lenient for the acts that are carried out. Placing sex offenders into prison for the rest of their natural lives will mean that they will never have the chance to commit anymore sex offences after conviction and will also make potential rapists and paedophiles less willing to take the risk of carrying out these vile offences.",
