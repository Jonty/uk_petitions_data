            "background": "The electorate voted for Tony Blair's party manifesto at the last general election.  They DID NOT vote for the current Chancellor, or his manifesto.  As such, it is undemocratic to 'swap' PMs mid-term.  It is also undemocratic to change party manifesto to one that was not voted for by the population of the United Kingdom.  I am not asking specifically that election law be changed, as this will take so long that it would not stop Mr Brown taking the position, regardless of public displeasure.  I am specifically asking for a general election in 2007, as I have the right to vote for my PM.  Any future change in election law would be a bonus.",
