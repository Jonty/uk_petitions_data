        "background": "My elderly, recently widowed, father was persuaded to change his electricity and gas contracts by a door to door salesman.  \n\nMy father was having an afternoon sleep when the man called and was a little confused when he opened the door to someone who asked for his dead wife by name. Despite a very good contract with his existing company the salesman signed him up.  Dad has never had to deal with the bills. My mother knew she did not have long and made sure that everything was in place so the household would run smoothly after she was gone.\n\nMy father became very upset and it worried him for over a week before he admitted to me that he did not want the contract.  He had felt pressured into signing to get rid of the salesman.  We have now had to try and cancel the contract with the company.\n\nThe door to door sales of utilities is indefensible.  By its nature it is high pressure, gutter marketing that prays on the vulnerable.\n\nIt should be banned.",
