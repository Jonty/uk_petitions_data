            "action": "enforce all electricity distribution networks companies to switch to supplying 230 volts to the home.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In 1988 an agreement was reached that voltage levels across Europe should be unified at 230V single phase with effect from January 1st, 1995.\n\nThe tolerance levels have become -6% to +10%, giving a single-phase voltage spread of 216 V to 253.  With the possible widening of tolerance levels to +/- 10% in 2008.\n\nAs 240V fits within this tolerance level the UK power distribution networks remain supplying electricity to the home at around the 240v mark.\n\nBy reducing the actual voltage received we would see around an 8% reduction in energy used and therefore around an 8% reduction in the cost of our electricity bills.",
