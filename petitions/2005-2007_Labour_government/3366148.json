Admittance under such circumstances renders the patron powerless to avoid drinking the most ridiculous of drinks, in often vastly over-sized portions.\nThe money saved from this proposal (and the money spent on such beverages)will enable me to purchase a fully-fitted hospital each month to support other 'victims' of the vaults resident devil - Paul 'evil-eye'.\nI thank you.",
