        "background": "Set up a National Vetrens Assosiaction. Along the same lines as The americam system, as it stands any vetren recieving a War pension as a job to live and pay bills, many of us gave to this country above and beyond when our country called us,its now time for the country to remember us. I propose that our pensions be boughtup to date above the rate of living as because we have pensions we are unable to claim any finacial help from the benifits system yet everybody else is able to recive every benifit going. also we should have acesss to Medicail servies straight away without waiting in Que, free dentistry,free eye tests and glasses,free prescriptions. acess to the best affordable housing,Free Banking weather we are in credit or no,Free Coach and rail Travel and all Vetrens to be reconinsed and be given the respect.\n\nI know there is a Vetrens Agentcy but they have very few powers  and are only really there for our pensions.",
