            "background": "I propose that the Prime Minister scraps all benefits in this country. I believe that too much money is wasted on income support, housing benefits and job seekers. Unless there is a proper reason to which I person is unable to work there is no reason why people who just 'draw the short straw' in life or just cant be bothered to work should get free money when everyone else has to work for it and on top of that pay a huge percentage of what they earn in tax. Think of the massive amount of money the government would save including the wages of the people who have track down the benefit fraudsters.\nAnd with this money what a huge improvement they could make to society.",
