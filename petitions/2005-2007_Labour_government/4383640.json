        "background": "Prevent the desecration of our beautiful landscape and one of the last areas of wilderness in the UK by not building 9 giant wind turbines in a valley on the edge of Dartmoor National Park. These planned turbines are 400 feet high (120 metres) and the highest in the country. Although in favour of renewable energy schemes, the amount of electricity which allegedly will be generated by this scheme does in no way compensate for the blot on our beloved landscape.  If you love the Devon countryside as much as we do, please sign this petition.  (over 3,000 local people objected, but their voices were not listed to in the Public Enquiry)",
