We believe that we need to stand up to up and coming countries like China and get them to come into line with the the majority of the world on issues such as human rights and higher standards of animal welfare.\nChina has, in preparation for the Olympics, commited horrific acts of cruelty to the animals, particularly dogs, of Beijing including the beating to death of dogs in the streets in front of their owners and children without any thought or care for the animals or people concerned. They also believe that in order to get 'elite' athletes that children as young as 4 should be forced to train hard to prepare them for sporting events.\nThese events have been extensively reported in the media.",
