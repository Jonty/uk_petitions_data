            "background": "There seems to be little point in submiting petitions to government just for them to be ignored - especially petitions which have wide support from the public. It is therefore proposed that where there is a huge number of petitioners - reflecting widely held views in the country - that a referendum will have to be held. This will strengthen democracy by allowing the public to have a voice on issues which they feel very strongly about. I would suggest that with this legislation in place we would not have become involved in a war in Iraq!",
