This is the second year running, what happened to Agenda for Change? ENOUGH is ENOUGH. It's time for Nurses to make a stand and stop this now, with Industrial Action if necessary. We are seeing RECORD NUMBERS of patients, with same staffing levels as years ago for LESS PAY! where is the patient safety? where is the fairness in this???",
