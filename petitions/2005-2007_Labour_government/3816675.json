These businesses are at risk. Business's situated in rural area\u2019s (a life-line to the local people) are often the only communal gathering venue available. These are at risk.\n\nIf it is proved that the Act has had a detrimental effect on Turnover and Profitability of any business, that business may be forced to cease trading.  \n\nA \u2018Designated Smoking Room\u2019 that affords a good ventilation system, is completely separate for the non-smoking part of the premises and where staff should not normally be required to work, may be the only viable way forward so that the business can attract more clientele. In these cases, provided it is proved both practical and advantageous for the survival of that individual business, then that business would qualify for the \u2018Special Exemption Rule\u2019.",
