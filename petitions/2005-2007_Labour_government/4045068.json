            "background": "There are legitimate reasons to officially make September 19th of every year national Talk Like a Pirate Day. Pirates such as Sir Francis Drake are national heroes, and have been knighted to commemorate this. Piracy is an integral part of our culture and our history. The day would be a public holiday celebrating all things piratey and various types of Rum. The government could fund community projects such as construct your own galleon, or invest in small scale business such as smugglers coves.",
