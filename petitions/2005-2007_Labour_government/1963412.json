            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The technology to restrict a vehicles speed [e.g., fuel starvation] has been available for decades. Automated real-time speed-limits [e.g., reduce in poor-conditions] directly address road-rage & hostility caused when driving slowly for miles on clear roads only to see 'hazard ends'. Radar-braking ensures vehicles will slow & eventually stop regardless of driver intervention, squark-box addition to engine management means remote braking [e.g., no more high-speed police-chases].",
