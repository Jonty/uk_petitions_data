So why isn't there a government website which will tell you what the CURRENT rules and regulations in this country are?\n\nThe HMSO website contains legislation AS PUBLISHED, so once you\u2019ve found the original text, you must go through the laborious and technically difficult process of amending by hand. This assumes you can find all of the amendments in the first place.\n\nWhere OUR legislation refers to EU legislation, or British Standards, those texts should also be freely available. It\u2019s no good saying number plates must conform to BS AU145d, if it then costs \u00a336 to find out what that standard is, for example.\n\nThe government makes the laws, so it should be in a position to clearly inform people what they are.\n\nPlease be open about what our laws are by publishing our current legislation. [A facility to check the current legislation as of any given date would also be useful.] This system would be more useful than the AS PUBLISHED texts. It would allow the ordinary person, and practitioners, to read the laws he is expected to abide by. He can seek legal advice if he doesn't understand it, but at least he has a fighting chance.",
