            "background": "I am requesting that working on a Friday afternoon for all types of work to be made illegal. Therefore all companies must adhere to the new ruling and close the workplace at 12:30 sharp. Reasons for this procedure could be better leisure time and to raise morale of the nation. Such procedure is used by many manufacturing companies at their discrection and I believe this idea should be carried across to every workplace. This would also work hand in hand with the ruling that all major retailers must close at 4:30 on a Sunday after noon.\n\nThis is not intendended to be humorous, please do not reject.\n\nThank you",
