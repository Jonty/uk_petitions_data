            "background": "To encourage promession and change the law which only allows burial or cremation. To reduce the tax on Councils through being more environmentally friendly. \n\nPromession is a freeze drying process of the  person following Death.  It uses liquid nitrogen which will be released back into its natural form of nitrogen and the remains break down into a dust through vibration.  All metals can then be extracted stopping mercury emissions as in Cremation.  The remains are buried in a environmentally friendly mulch able coffin. Within 12 months the remains are compost and nature will absorb the nutrients and encourage plant life.  It would be a good method of recycling our remains and contribute to the Environment.",
