        "background": "Tests on animals are cruel and inhumane. what makes this cruelty even more unbelievable is that it is used to test cosmetic products like shampoo and deodrant. this barbaric practice is unnecessary because there are lots of other options for cosmetic companies that don't involve innocent animals being subjected to what is basically torture. Most cosmetic products produced by supermarkets are not tested on animals, and they are just as good as products that are. we need to make a stand to outlaw this horrible industry",
