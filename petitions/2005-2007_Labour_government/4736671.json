        "background": "Between 856 and 1016 the British people paid approximately 60 million Anglo Saxon pennies to the Danish government in the form of protection money (called the Danegeld) - this protection racket netting the Danish economy an estimated 85,000kg of silver.  The purchasing power of the silver at the time would be equivalent to approximately \u00a31 billion today.  We hereby petition the Prime Minister and the the British Government to demand the immediate return of the Danegeld, plus interest from the Danish government, payable at 1% per annum.  The total amount of \u00a319163.79 billion should be paid in silver pennies along with a written assurance from Queen Margrethe II of Denmark that the Danish people will never again make such demands.",
