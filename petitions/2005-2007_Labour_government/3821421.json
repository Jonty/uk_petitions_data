        "background": "Currently anyone rent out a property with no training, Criminal record checks or proper accountability. It is about time that landlords had to have  a license to prove that they are fit to be a landlord. You can't be a taxi-driver without a licence why should letting out property be any different. i have heard of quite a few landlords that refuse perfectly normal/legal requests to provide information to their tenants and the only recourse is to go to the courts. If landlords were licenced like taxi-drivers their would at least be some easier and less costly recourse against rogue landlords (instead of going straight to the courts), it would stop criminals using rented property as a way of laundering money and it would give peace of mind to hundreds of thousands of tenants",
