        "background": "MPs are debating a bill to exempt themselves and peers from Freedom of Information Act inquiries.\n\nDavid Maclean, who introduced the bill, says he is trying to maintain his constituents\u2019 confidentiality. \n\nThe only possible reason they should want this exemption is that they have something to hide. Confidentiality is already provided to everyone under existing laws and data protection legislation. As publicly elected representatives, paid for by the public and who are supposed to SERVE the public, we have every right to know what they do for us - all MP's should be more accountable to the public, not less. Furthermore we the public have every right to know what we pay OUR employees for, what expenses they claim and how often. MP's should be open to public scrutiny.\n\nWe the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to prevent this becoming law.",
