            "background": "Where I live, Bristol, the bus services available to the public are frankly appalling. Although in this city a large amount of problems can be attributed to one of the worst road infrastructures in the country, I still believe an amount of the blame should be placed on the private bus firms. Not only in Bristol but elsewhere firms are taking advantage of what should be a pollution reducing and easy to use service by charging extortionate prices and offering a poor and often fustrating service. I the signatory call upon the Government to take action on bus companies' operations, and boost a lagging public transport sector in the UK.",
