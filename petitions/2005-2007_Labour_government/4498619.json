            "background": "Each year many children and adults ar more seriously injured, or die, due to not wearing a cycle helmet when on a bicycle.  The introduction of such a law will remove peer pressure for those who wish to be safe, but don't want teasing and will enforce safety in the same way that powered two wheelers are protected.  People are also under the misconception that cycling on grass on parks is safe to do without helmets, however a fall from any bike on any surface could be fatal, and helmets therefore should be compulsory at all times and for all people.",
