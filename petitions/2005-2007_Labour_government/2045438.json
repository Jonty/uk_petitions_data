The Governement insists that this is the only way to create a reference when paying Pensions and Benifits. This reference is then shown on Bank Accounts. The Work and Pensions Minister says that it is up to the individual to destroy his Bank Statements. They do not take account of all of the people in banks who have access to the details or of any mistakes made by banks in destroying such details. I do not want my National Insurance Number used as a reference but the Government (Work and Pensions) insist it is the only way they can use to make a reference.",
