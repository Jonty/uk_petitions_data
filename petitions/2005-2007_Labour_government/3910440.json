All too often a significant minority are able to affect policy by being the most vocal and creating moral panics. As such we need \"protection... against the tyranny of the prevailing opinion and feeling\" (JS Mill).\n\nWe believe all political issues demand and deserve full intelligent consideration on an open platform combining views and opinions from the widest possible range of communities. This can not be achieved through petitions.",
