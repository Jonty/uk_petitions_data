            "background": "Work-place bullying costs the country billions of pounds and destroys lives, yet there is no  law against it, making it difficult to win cases in a tribunal. The Dignity at Work bill was put together by the MSF Union in 1996 but blocked by the Conservative government. Following the general election, the Labour government has yet to resurrect this bill. This bill would have outlawed bullying.",
