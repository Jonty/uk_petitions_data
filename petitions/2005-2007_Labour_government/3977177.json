            "background": "A company known as themob dot com promised hundreds of customers money through a cashback scheme if they bought a mobile phone handset from them. The phone had to be connect to the 3mobile network.  \nthemobs dot com was promoted by a link from 3mobile's own website, inferring that 3mobile were promoting themobs.com as a genuine supplier.\nNow hundreds of customers have been left high and dry as themobs.com have gone out of business.\nWhether this was intentional or not, 3mobile are not interested and anyone who has complained to them has been rejected.\nIt is therefore suggested that as the initial link came from the 3mobile website, they should be made liable for the cashback due to their customers.",
