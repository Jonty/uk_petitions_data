            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The Department of Transport now has a UK road infrastructure with many seemingly unnecessary causes of congestion and delay. The DoT should review its policies, and thereafter the transport infrastructure from the motorways downwards, to prioritise high traffic flow. Examples of traffic flow impediments include:- traffic lights that halt traffic when no other traffic is waiting, lights that break up roundabout transit into impractical 100yd hops and which operate throughout the night, two lane motorways that allow lorries to overtake and block all traffic, road narrowings that cause congestion and accidents, bus lanes that ban cars even when no buses are running (such as after midnight), 3 mile and longer roadworks on motorways, and many others. Please sign this petition if you think the DoT needs to rethink its traffic policies and make changes to prioritise good traffic flow.",
