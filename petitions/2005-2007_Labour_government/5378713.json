            "action": "introduce legislation so that road central white line markings in all areas where the speed limit is less than 60mph are changed and color coded for differing speeds, ie. red lines in a 30 zone. This would then constantly remind motorists of what the local limit is, thereby making it easier to drive safer and within the law.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "I would like to see legislation introduced making it necessary for authorities to have to mark roads more clearly to help motorists stay within speed limits. Occasional speed signs are often not enough as they can be difficult to spot, particularly if you are new to an area or are looking at a different part of the road. \n\nIn 30 mph limits, the white central lines could be painted red throughout the area where that speed is enforced. In 40 mph areas the lines could be blue and in National 60 mph areas the lines could stay white as they are already. On Motorways and dual-carriageways, changes would also be unecessary.\n\nThis would then take away any ambiguity about \"am I in a 30 mph zone or not\", as there would be a constant and easy reminder always at hand.",
