        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently, members of the UK Youth Parliament are promoting a campaign to make university free for all young people across the United Kingdom.\n\nCurrently we have thousands of signatures for this campaign (hand written). This was at first only conducted on a regional scale in the West Midlands, however we have now extended this nationally due to its regional success.\n\nThis is part of a developing national campaign throughout the United Kingdom which is gathering more and more support all the time, and many events are being planned across the United Kingdom including a hopeful debate in the Houses of Parliament (we have an MP who has confirmed they will book us a room) and a high profile delivery of the petitions to 10 Downing Street (again, this will be the paper based signatures).\n\nWith more support, members of UKYP feel that our aim could be achieved \u2013 to abolish university fees and make university free for all young people across the United Kingdom!",
