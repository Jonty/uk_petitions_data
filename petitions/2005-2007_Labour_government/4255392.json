The government needs to set clear, consistent and compulsory guidelines for young adults to be taught about sex and relationships.\nI believe that as in Holland with the introduction of guidelines, it will lead to lower cases of Sexual Transmitted Infections and Teenage Pregnancy.\n\n\nMany Thanks\n\nSam Yarnold",
