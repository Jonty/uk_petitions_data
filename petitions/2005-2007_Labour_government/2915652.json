            "background": "The government claim they have increased the number of police officers, this is a myth as they include PCSO's in these numbers.  PCSO's have very few powers.  PCSO's should be scrapped and the money spent on proper police officers and prisoner handling units. Once a police officer has made an arrest they may be in the station dealing with the prisoner for around 8 hours, prisoner handling units will allow the officers to get back out on the streets quicker and therefore negate the need for PCSO's.",
