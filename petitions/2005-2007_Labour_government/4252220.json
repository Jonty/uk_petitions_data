            "background": "From: The Independent, 23/3/07:\n\nIn Zimbabwe, Gonseso was involved with the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC), providing activists with shelter and transport.\n\nMugabe loyalists took brutal retribution, savagely beating him and threatening to close his businesses. In 2003 he fled, leaving his wife, Chiedza, and their children and ended up staying with a friend in the West Midlands.\nSoon after he claimed asylum, he heard that government militiamen had killed his wife.\n\"Mr Goneso's first asylum application was rejected after three years, but he made a second immediately afterwards, arguing that his activism with the MDC made it impossible for him to return. He had heard nothing until a letter this month told him his financial support was being terminated. Now he relies on charity from the Red Cross and fears eviction. And if the Home Office wins a case going through the courts over the status of Zimbabwean asylum-seekers, he could be ordered to leave.\nHe only speaks to his three children, who are living with his parents, about once a fortnight.",
