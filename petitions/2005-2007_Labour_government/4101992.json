        "background": "For the past twenty years, scientific professionals have been warning the government about the effects of Global warming and Carbon emmission. Until very recently, and the threat has been realised, little or no attention has really been paid by the Government, being dismissed as not bearing any immediate threat. Now the government are bringing into force new and extensive measures to combat and attempt to reduce the effects of Global Warming, the expense of which will mostly be met by the tax payer, who face road pricing, parking and higher fuel bills. It's time the Government paid for its own ignorance, and should be forced to either listen when the time is right, or pay the penalty for it's own complacency, without burdening the tax payer.",
