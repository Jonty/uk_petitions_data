            "background": "As sex education is schools is NOT compulsary,it has made the british teenage pregnancy go up by lots.\nAs in holland, the concent age is 14, but many children do not have sex until they're older than the concent age because they have so much education on the subject, it is not a big thing if you do it or not. I think that in britain, if we was to have COMPULSARY sex education in our schools, i think that teenage pregancy could go down like a millions!!! SIGN THE PETITION!!!!",
