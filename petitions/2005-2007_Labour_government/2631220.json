            "background": "I think Birmingham should be the capital of England because we have the Bullring, NEC, NIA, Aston Villa and many other great places to go and a great accent too. It is in a central location which means it is easy for everyone to get to. We don't have a congestion charge aswell unlike London. It is a very culturally diverse city the most diverse in England and has great things like the balti triangle. We have produced great bands and artists down the years such as UB40, Black Sabbath, The Streets, Ocean Colour Scene, Duran Duran, Musical Youth, Editors and The Twang. Also we have more canals than Venice. We were also home to MG Rover and are still home to HP Sauce your bacon sandwich wouldn't be the same without it.",
