            "background": "Hogging the middle or fast lanes of motorways causes frustration and danger by forcing drivers to move from lane to lane to overtake inconsiderate drivers. The drivers won't change their driving habits, so why not allow overtaking on the inside?. All vehicles have, by law, to be fitted with a nearside mirror; so it should only take a short advertising campaign before allowing this measure and FREE UP THE MOTORWAYS.",
