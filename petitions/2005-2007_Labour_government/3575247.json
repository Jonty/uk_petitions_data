        "background": "New build properties - including social housing are not adequately soundproofed or insulated - privacy is important at home and hearing next door neighbours doing the daily human stuff is very hard to live with and makes life miserable - ditto insulations in loft rooms - unbearably hot in summer - you can feel the suns rays permeating the roof - and freezing in winter- urgent action is needed - I believe this will benefit everybody - in the case of social housing reduce a lot of 'anti' behaviour -  please act immiediately  for all concerned.",
