        "background": "We, as members of a civilised  society, bear the responsibility to protect the innocent and the vulnerable.\n\nToday we are failing in that responsibility through the inexplicably lenient sentences being issued to paedophiles for their crimes.\n\nThe current sentences fall unacceptably short of reflecting the grotesque and damaging nature these crimes have on it's victims, their families and our society as a whole. \n\nThe sentences being issued do not reflect the gravity of the crimes nor do they convey a fair and balanced notion of justice.\n\nWe therefore call for a substantial increase in the minimum sentences to accurately reflect the appalling nature of these crimes.",
