A panel of judges should decide who is allowed to enter, they hold a vote, and if the male/female wins the majority of the vote, they are allowed into the country. This rule would deal with the asylum problem, as well as making the country more pleasing on the eye. ie... more beautiful ladies, means more money for nightlife and tourist attractions, as the locations will be more attractive to native Brits. Thanks for the time. Calum",
