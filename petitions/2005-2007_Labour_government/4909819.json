However it carries no subtitles.\n\nDeaf and hard of hearing people cannot access this content.  Thus marginalised and not part of an 'inclusive society;.\n\nThis petition is for Downing Street to comply with the DDA and actually make all its online content accessible.\n\nFurthermore, it calls on the government to encourage other service providers to subtitle content online, by setting an example.",
