            "background": "The Lyons enquiry is considering plans to introduce a bed tax on hotel and holiday accommodation to enable Councils to raise more money. This idea ignores the fact that operators of all types of accommodation already pay business rates all year even if their accommodation is empty. The imposition of this tax will drive up prices and encourage people to holiday abroad and seriously damage a major industry and earner of foreign income for this country.Holiday makers contribute to local economies and do not cost them money and so should be encouraged not taxed and driven away.",
