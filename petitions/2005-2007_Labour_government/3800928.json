        "background": "Today its all too easy to get into debt, and I believe its the credit card companies who are primarily responsible for this. If they were required by law to immediately stopped all payments on cards that the owners had not met the minimum repayments on, then people would not be in so much debt.\nThere also needs to be a penalty for credit card companies that don't help their customers get back on track. Perhaps a fine for every account that has a card over the limit. \nIf it is obvious that the credit card company did nothing to help the credit card owner from going into debt, then perhaps the credit card company would be forced to write off the debt.",
