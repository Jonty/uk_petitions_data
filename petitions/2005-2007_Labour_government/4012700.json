All MP's seem to do is bicker with one another or try to make others look silly in the commons, which is why politicians are scared to apologise for making mistakes. I for one would respect an MP who admits mistakes, apologises and works to rectify the mistake. If all parties worked together instead of against each other, things would get done instead of just talked about.",
