        "background": "My insurance company wanted almost \u00a3200 to cancel my car insurance!\n\nI was looking at changing my car insurance over to a new company that was cheaper (\u00a3400 cheaper) but offered the same level of cover. However, because I wanted to cancel my insurance before the renewal date, my existing insurance company demanded I pay a months premium and the cost of the remaining days left in the month. In my case this meant that I would have to pay almost \u00a3200 JUST TO CANCEL MY CAR INSURANCE even though I only had 3 months left before it was due for renewal and I have been with them for many years.\nSo instead of having a set cancellation fee they base the fee on your premium. Pitty those with expensive premiums!!!!\nI would not have a problem if they said I had to pay an administration fee of \u00a315 maybe even \u00a320 as I appreciate it takes time to cancel and time is money.\n\nNeedless to say I resent paying them that amount of money and will be waiting till my insurance is up for renewal.",
