            "background": "Meadowbank Stadium is a valuable asset. It has hosted many memorable events including two Commonwealth Games, produced many Olympic athletes and is used daily by hundreds of people from the immediate area and beyond.\n\nIt is a long-term legacy for the local community and the country. The site has been used for sporting purposes for generations. At a time when people are being encouraged to be fit and healthy, a prime recreation facility like this shouldn't be sold for high density housing.\n\nEdinburgh Council plan to build a small stadium on the other side of the city involving the destruction of several playing fields and a net loss in facilities available. There are several sports complexes in west Edinburgh but there would be a lack of facilities near the centre should Meadowbank be demolished. People would have to travel up to one hour longer. These facilities should remain at Meadowbank. Edinburgh Council should consider alternative proposals to meet the needs of the current users.",
