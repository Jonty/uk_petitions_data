But people who want to make a healthy choice and buy smoothies and juices get taxed 17.5% VAT.\n\nIt's a simple step, and, as more and more people get their fruit in liquid form, it could make a big difference. Our research shows that at least 500 million more portions of fruit would be consumed each year if this happened. Since we all know that eating more fruit and veg is essential to being healthier, it makes sense to help people make positive choices.",
