            "background": "In last 3 months I have been in 4 near misses that have all been caused by apalling driving 1)Using an area of hatching to overtake & nearly hitting a car which was turning right 2)Driving so fast he could not stop so went throgh red lights nearly hitting a pedestrian 3)Nearly running down a police officer on a push bike due to steering with elbow whilst holding a sandwich with one hand & other holding his mobile to his ear 4)Driving on wrong side of road whilst not concentrating & nearly hitting a car coming in the opposite direction. During conversations with more than 1 driver I have been told it common practice for a number of people from a family to share a driving liscence meaning in the event of an accident the passenger is not covered by insurance.",
