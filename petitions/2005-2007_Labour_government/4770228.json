Whilst this is welcomed as proof of the Government continuing to make electoral affairs an important factor in policy, I am concerned that any minister within this department will be \"swamped\" by more high profile affairs of this department. \n\nI ask the Prime Minister to ensure that this department keeps electoral administration, reform, and constitutional affairs at the centre of its remit - through a continued Cabinet presence for the relevant minister, maybe a name change to Ministry of Justice and Local Governance.",
