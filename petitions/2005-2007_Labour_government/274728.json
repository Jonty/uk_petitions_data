            "background": "By abolishing taxation on 'normal' (car, van, MPV, etc) vehicles and adding a proportional amount of taxation onto fuel based on a realistic evaluation of average annual mileage and vehicle fuel consumption a truly proportional taxation system will be created to deal with (amongst others):\n\nRoad use: No flat rate road fund license means that instead of a flat fee for both high and low mileage drivers the tax becomes proportional to your road usage.\n\nPollution: Instead of taxing vehicle owners simply for OWNING a higher pollution vehicle, the 'green' tax you pay becomes directly proportional to the amount of fuel you use.\n\nSpecial case (HGV, etc) vehicles could simply pay extra taxation through their MOT requirement.\n\nSuch reform in taxation would demonstrate to the public that the government wants to be seen as open & fair on the issue, rather than broke & scrabbling for every penny it can get which true or not IS how it appears unless 'greedy' is a preferred adjective.",
