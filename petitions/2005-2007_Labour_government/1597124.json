Blackpool has the full backing of the Chamber and the North West Development Agency amongst other stakeholders.\n\nThe Chamber has outlined the above comments, along with many more important points, in extensive correspondence with the Secretary of State for the Department of Culture, Media and Sport; Tessa Jowell.",
