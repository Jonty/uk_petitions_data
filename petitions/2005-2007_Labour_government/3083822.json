            "background": "This petition is mainly about the proposed plans to invade peoples privacy to calculate council tax. Information such as what food or goods you buy using information from club cards, if pets are kept, what paper you read, illness', even if you do a crossword.\nImagine being phoned up to ask why you've bought dog food even though you do not own a dog and are buying it for a neighbour, and then the Council Snooper asking you why you changed from cereal to toast, and why you are reading a different paper. All for tax purposes.\nImagine being constantly tracked by your mobile phone, or by your car road pricing box.  \nTo have no privacy without giving up your phone, car, club cards, bank accounts, internet, and avoiding cameras everywhere,including 'x-ray cameras' that could see through your clothes.\nWe have a right to privacy. Our privacy needs to be protected now before we lose it.",
