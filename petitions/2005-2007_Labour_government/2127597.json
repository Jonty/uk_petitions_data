This would be an excellent way of encouring poeple into work as well as limiting unemployed payouts as well as making best use of an untapped resource. This would be an excellent way of improving our economy and also making the streets more attractive for all including visitors. With a number of poeple happy to rely on pay outs and not work it is about time we used them to get our services up to scatch.",
