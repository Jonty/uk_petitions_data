        "background": "Birmingham needs an effecient mass transit system. Plans to extend the current 'one line' midland metro have been scrapped. The only sources of travel are the very limited overland train system and public buses and there is no way of commuting easily and quickly around what is afterall the UK's second city. This is an embarrassment to our nation, it creates everyday torment for the people of the West Midlands and visitors, particularly those who are shunted through the crumbling, ourcrowded New St Station - the nations busiest train station. Furthermore it must surely be impacting hugely on the environment and peoples health to have so many unecessary buses. After losing out on the national stadium, the millenium dome, the super casino, the arena central project and more, it is surely about time the government gave something back to the proud people of Birmingham and the West Midlands. Particularly when so much seems to be being done on further improving the capitals wonderful system!!",
