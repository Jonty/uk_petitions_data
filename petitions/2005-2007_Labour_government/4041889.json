            "background": "Move the Congestion charge camera near Royal oak station on Porchester Road 300 yards further down that same road so access to the A40 slip road heading out of london from Gloucester Terrace can be used.\nI thought The charge was meant to stop people going into London Not heading out.\nThere is also an issue about pollution as you can travel 2 miles further into London without entering the Charging zone to gain access to the A40 slip Road heading outer London, what effect is that having on our environment.",
