            "background": "Dear Mr Blair\nWhen will your claims of a better health service and shorter waiting lists become a reality? You claim we already have this, we do not.If you require a wisdom tooth removed and it has to be done in a NHS hospital the waiting is rediculous. I have spent over 3 months just being passed between different dentists as each said \"no I can not do it\", now I face a minimum of 4 months waiting for a NHS hospital, in this case it is Worthing in Sussex. I have been in pain for most of this time as the tooth is broken and decayed, all we hear from the Government is how improved the health service is and how much waiting times are down. What happened to patients not being allowed to be in pain?\nAnd still they want to demolish hospitals, please please sign this petition and help to bring this issue to the attention of others.",
