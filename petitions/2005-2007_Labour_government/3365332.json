            "background": "Convicted offenders should be made to realise that a prison sentence is not just an inconvenience. Offenders should be made to acknowledge their crimes and pay their debt to society by sheer hard work. There would be a dramatic decline in the prison population if punishment consisted of forced labour in the form of chain gangs and an immediate withdrawal of luxuries ie TV's and game consoles etc., It is a complete farce to complain of prison overcrowding when there is no deterrent to serving a jail sentence. Deter crime by making time served in prison a very uncomfortable and unforgettable experience, word would soon get around that a spell inside isn't as easy as it used to be. Perhaps then a jail term wouldn't be seen by some to be a badge of honour and people would think twice about committing a criminal offence.",
