            "background": "The casino advisory panel have recommended Manchester for a Super Casino. Manchester is getting more regeneration money than any other area of the country already. The Common Wealth Games the BBC and Labour Party Conferences. Blackpool Council Tax payers are trying to hang on to their heritage by subsidising the tramway, the Grand Theatre, the Illuminations and Winter Garden Conference Centre. Without a catalyst for regeneration the decline of the resort will become irreversiable and the old attractions will fade away. Please Mr Blair intervene to help Blackpool. Destination gambling is the vision for Blackpool not damaging doorstep gambling. With this catalyst other investors such as legoland will come to the town to ctreate a holiday resort. What a way to reduce the carbon footprint by encouraging less flights abroad and more visits to an English holiday resort.",
