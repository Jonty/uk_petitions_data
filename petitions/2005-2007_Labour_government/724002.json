            "background": "Our 'Government' refuse to support our pensioners & give those who have contributed to Downing Street's swollen coffers for the majority of their working lives liveable State pensions. How can they justify allowing amnesty to illegal immigrants who have already been working in the 'black' economy for a number of years, thereby paying no tax or national insurance contributions - does the Government honestly think this will encourage these illegals already here to 'come clean' and do what the rest of us do and pay our multitude of taxes on what we earn and spend ? On the contrary, one of our European 'allies' (Italy) has already tried and tested the self same policy 5 times and all it has done is swell  the number of economic parasites heading into their country.\nThese islands are full to bursting point already and the decrepit infrastructure cannot support residents as it is - STOP this madness NOW !",
