            "background": "As an avid fan of the BBC and its output, I see a real-terms reduction in its funding as being completely counter-productive. The BBC's role in the cultural development of this country cannot be exaggerated, and its funding should reflect the increasingly difficult conditions in the international media arena. It already has to cope with the huge burden of the digital transition, and any reduction would leave its other services severely underfunded. Much-needed serious content is being squeezed out by ratings-grabbing, and it is the responsibility of the Government to safeguard this culturally important programming, whereas the BBC would otherwise be forced to reduce its spending on factual programming. Thank you.",
