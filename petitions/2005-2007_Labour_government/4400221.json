            "background": "It should be illegal to demand detailed information about parents, their occupations and educational background on university application forms. This is discrimination at its most insidious.\nAll applicants should be treated equally and the only criteria for acceptance should be ability. If we had a decent education system in the first place everyone would have equal opportunities. Instead, the traditional middle class student is being penalised because of successive governments' failures and inability to provide appropriate education for all. The price of this crazy policy is (and will continue to be) far too many  drop outs and unemployable graduates, a shortage of graduates in vital areas such as maths, chemistry and engineering and a lot of second rate managers - as if we didn't already have enough.",
