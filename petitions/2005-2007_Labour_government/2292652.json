However when recently in Hammersmith Hospital, the Liverpool Royal and many GP surgeries, most Doctors barely speak enough english to communitcate and in stressful and personal situations, this is disgraceful, yet the elitist attitude of Universities towards people wishing to study medicine, and the priorities toward national students, it is no wonder the NHS is in disarray considering its not really represented by its own people!",
