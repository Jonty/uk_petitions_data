            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Grade inflation is a serious problem with the A-level, with 95% of candidates getting passes. By moving to a percentile based marking system, those who get the best results will be more easily reported, whilst all will still be stretched. In addition, the creation of a flat number of \u201cDistinctions\u201d will allow higher education & industry to identify the best & brightest \u2013 but without wholesale & expensive change to the existing A-level system.",
