            "background": "For hundreds of years, left-handed people have been stigmatised and repressed -- often on the grounds of a religious association of the left with evil (hence the derivation of the word 'sinister' which, in Latin, means simply 'left')-- by the right-handed majority.\n\nFurther, this oppression continues today, albeit in a less overt way. Left-handed people are placed at a constant disadvantage by society. Nearly all tools and devices are designed to be comfortably used with the right hand, causing left-handed people considerable discomfort in day-to-day tasks.\n\nWe, the undersigned, call upon the government to apologise for this continued oppression and to legislate to end the discrimination -- particularly in the manufacture of tools -- that causes thousands of needless injuries to left-handed people every year.",
