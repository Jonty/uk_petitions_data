            "background": "Many of the signatories to the anti-road pricing petition signed after following a link from a mass-forwarded email which contained wild speculation, scaremongering and outright lies. The petition itself ignored the fact that the scheme may replace fuel tax. We urge the government to ignore such an undemocractic, badly put together argument, and instead have an open and fair debate about road pricing. This petition is not necessarily for road pricing, but it is against undemocratic, lying and bullying behaviour, and does not want policy to be influenced by a vocal minority who will use underhand tactics to gain support, or by newspapers who think they speak for the people.",
