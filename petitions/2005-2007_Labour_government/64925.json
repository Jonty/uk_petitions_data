Currently there is not one offical language taught in British schools only the schools choice of languages , this is why it does not work in this country. I propose we only have Spanish taught in British schools (no longer French, German est.) as Spanish is the next most spoken language after English and is easy and will actually proberly be used as most Brits go to spain at least once in a life time.",
