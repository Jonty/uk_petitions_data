            "background": "With the introduction of devolution, MP's from Scotland and Wales can vote on English affairs such as tuition fees etc. At the same time, as Scotland and Wales has it's own parliament, English MP's cannot vote on Scottish or Welsh affairs. As a result, Scottish and Welsh MPs are voting in changes into English law which like the tuition fees cost English students only, more money. This is not constitutional and as such these additonal voting powers should be removed immediately from Scottish and Welsh MPs",
