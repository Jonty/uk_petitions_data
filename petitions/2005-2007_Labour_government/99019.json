        "background": "Fingerprinting is being introduced in thousands of UK Primary Schools as part of a subsidised library package called Junior Librarian that they have purchased, encouraged by central government. New schools are joining the scheme at the rate of around 20 a week. To date, more than 3500 schools and nurseries (manufacturer's official figure, given to the Daily Mirror) have fingerprinted and photographed 3/4 million children, ranging in age from 3 to 11; impressionable, trusting and naive. \nCapita Education Services have made Vericool and EasyTrace, premier partners with access to their SQL database AND a commercial arrangement for the reselling or endorsement or their products.\n#### This is always done without explicit parental consent, and even in some cases, without parental knowledge.### Schools strongly resist sending parents the opt-in consent slips that are used for just about everything else. Some parents only find out AFTERWARDS",
