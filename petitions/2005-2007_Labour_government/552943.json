            "background": "I want to make it legal to get payed to do homework and coarse work(GCSE's etc) in secondary schools as it takes up quite a lot of free time when some people go to organisations such as the cadet forces and as I am a Sea Cadet I can say that I learn much more there than i do at school and the things i learn there are useful for future careers. And as we get homework over the weekend we cant go on coarses with the cadets to get qualifications which makes it easier to get any job and not just in the armed forces.",
