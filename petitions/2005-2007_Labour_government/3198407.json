            "background": "I propose that many traffic lights could be turned off between the hours of 9pm and 7am. This would have two benefits:\n1) Allow drivers out at this time to not have to repeatedly stop unnecessarily when there are no cars anywhere near the junction, and instead us their skill and judgement.\n2) It would surely have an impact on the UK's carbon emissions, as the power used to keep these lights on at night must be appreciable.\n\nObviously investmnt would be needed to create give way markings at junctions to establish priority when the lights are off but this would be a small price to pay for attempting to combat global warming",
