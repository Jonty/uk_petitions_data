            "background": "It seems an unfair anomaly of the Stamp Duty legislation that if I purchase a property for \u00a3250,000 that is not subject to VAT, I pay 1% Stamp Duty i.e. \u00a32500 - but if that property is subject to VAT not only do I pay my Stamp Duty on the gross price of \u00a3293750, but also - in this example - I have to pay it at 3% because it takes me into the next band i.e. \u00a38812. In other words, in this example, I have paid an additional \u00a36312 (or more than three times the original \u00a32500) in Stamp Duty merely because the property I purchased was subject to VAT.",
