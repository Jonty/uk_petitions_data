            "background": "With the proposal to charge for parking an the town's railway station car park, spaces in the surrounding areas, where it is already difficult to park, will be at a premium. Many of the streets in close proximity to the Adam Smith College and the town centre have time restrictions of around half an hour without the ownership of a resident's permit. Quite often, these spaces, which are far to numerous in the first place, lie empty the whole day as residents are at work. This means that Students, lecturers (who often have to carry a variety of items pertaining to their course)and those who work in the town do not have many places to park without having to pay or face a lengthy walk. For some people, public transport is not an option due to distance or infrequency. Parking in the town should be arranged in a more sensible manner so as not to discriminate against non-residents.",
