It would not solve the break down in today's society but I feel this could be a small step to help. Youth centres are generally not very well run and not many children/teenagers want to go to them. I feel money would be better spent organsing swimming courses and other activites that children in each local area wish to do, especially in the summer holidays. Children could also be encouraged to fund raise to help towards their activites.",
