            "action": "immediately halt the Department of Work and pensions persecution of mentally ill people. Threatening benefit claimants suffering mental illness with cuts in their benefits if they do not attend Work Focused Interviews is a ridiculous attitude, these people are ill and should not be forced to engage in such activity.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The whole point of Incapacity Benefit is to support those who are ill and unable to work. Many Mentally Ill people, particulary those with depression and anxiety find the prospect of attending such interviews -and having to discuss their illness with people who can at times be rude and judgemental - severly worrying and intimadating.\n\nForcing these people to attend these interviews only causes their illness to worsen. They are exempt completely from such activity by law, but yet the DWP still threaten and wrongfully cut many mentally ill claimants benefits, forcing them to endure attending an intimidating appeals panel to have the decision reversed.\n\nThe decision makers at the DWP must be educated more about mental illnesses to prevent the persecution of these claimants, who have become an easy target for stigmatized discrimination when submitting benefit claims.",
