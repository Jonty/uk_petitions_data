            "background": "Since 1954, over 130 individuals have met annually in secret locations both in Europe and the US.These meetings, called \nthe Bilderberg group after the Hotel where the first meeting took place is also host to MPs from the UK. Discussions are held to set policy away from the view of the public. For the ordinary citizen it is next to impossible to find out what is discussed, certainly impossible to find details of conclusions or policies drawn. \nThis is not how I define democracy, indeed it is its antithesis.\nI urge, therefore, that the government passes a law making it mandatory for MPs \nwho attend to report to Parliament and the public at large what was discussed, proposals and conclusions drawn.",
