            "background": "Currently patients are given the choice whether they want to wash or not in hospital.  My mother was in hospital in Birmingham for six weeks and during this time did not have one bath or shower.  I pleaded with the staff to let me wash my mother and they refused as my mother had been half heartedly asked if she wanted to have a shower and she had said that she did not . My mother does not have full control of her mental faculties and so this was very unfair to her.  She began to smell as did many of the other elderly patients who had refused showering and bathing .  Still Patients Choice gave them the right to refuse.  Surely with MRSA and other bugs this is wrong.  Also one elderly lady was refusing to eat and again staff said Patients Choice which meant the elderly lady was starving to death and no one was doing anything to help her.",
