        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Despite the use of mobile phones whilst driving being banned, there are still millions of drivers who feel that this law does not apply to them. The minimum punishment for use of mobile phones whilst driving should be confiscation of the vehicle plus a three year ban. The confiscated vehicles should be sold and the funds raised be given to police forces. This would encourage the police to enforce this law.",
