How on earth is \u00a3100\u2019s of millions spent on Eastenders a national service to the people of this country or the \u00a318 million contract paid to Jonathan Ross, These are not national services, they should be on their own pay channel with the choice to subscribe. We would like an openly funding reasonably priced national news service.",
