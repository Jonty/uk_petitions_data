This is why we should have stopped and listened and talked a little bit more first before throwing ourselves into a situation that we knew little about. Many other countries didn\u2019t support military action for a reason, maybe we should have stopped and found out why this was before committing? This leads me to our biggest crime, it being that we, by our actions, completely undermined the UN, how can we use the UN to make this world a safer and better place when we ourselves ignore its authority? It should be our aim to unify the UN, not to make a joke of it.",
