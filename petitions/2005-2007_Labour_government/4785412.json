            "background": "Its about time someone did something about children musically in this country. Very few have the chance to play an instrument and those that do usually play something unbearably dull like the recorder. Its time that changed.\n The ukulele is one of the worlds most underated instrument, it has a beautiful sound, and massive depths and posibiltitys plus it is one of the easiest and most addictive fun instrumemnts to learn, even if you are not musical.\n There is already a large movement in favour of the ukulele in britain, and i myself am connected with some of its members, also why not make britain the new hawaii? We have links to the uke through such legends as george formby, although he may have gave the ukulele a bit of a comic image.\n Join us, lets do something amazing.",
