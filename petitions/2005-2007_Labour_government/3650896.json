            "background": "We have a local ongoing petition here in S. Lincs with approx 2000 signatures to SAVE THE GREYHOUND SANCTUARY which the unscrupulous SHDC see fit to ignore, which is totally in favour of saving the santuary.\nSHDC accuse the Sanctuary of causing demonstrably harm to the environment and the local village.  SHDC have been repeatedly asked to explain their exact objection to the Sanctuary which they have repreatedly failed to do.  Which they believe is their right, and also ignore public opinion.  Here in Holbeach Drove there are 7 objectee properties 15 supportive properties and approx 30 neutral properties.  We have repeatedly asked the Planning Appeal Inspectorate to place this unusual case before the 1 st Secretary of State they have denied this saying that the lives of Greyhounds are not important enough.",
