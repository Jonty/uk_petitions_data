            "background": "The introduction of all seater stadia in the English Premier league has placed a severe financial burden on economically disadvantaged football supporters. This has seen traditional supporters priced out of the game and stadium capacities slashed.\nTerracing traditionally provides more affordable access. Stimulates a greater atmosphere and is as safe for the supporter as all seater stadia when constructed with all due consideration.",
