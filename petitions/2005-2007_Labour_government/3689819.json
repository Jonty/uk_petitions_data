        "background": "water charges are fast becoming a mortgage item. The 2007/08 rate increase is in excess 0f 10% for United Utilities.   This millenium has seen year on year increases in excess of the rate of inflation. Water is a basic necessity and human right. It is a resource which should not be owned and manipulated by the few to the detriment of the many. Thatcher promised a fair system of charging which would not be linked to the defunked rateable value system. Since then nothing has changed and the old system of charging remains. This has nothing to do with fairness and usage demands. A house with an average sized family will pay the same as a neighbour living on his/her own whilst the usage and return via sewerage disposal is quite obviously considerably higher for the family. This cannot be fair.",
