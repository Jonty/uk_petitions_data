A referendum which will clearly define the limits of the power the supra-national body will have over the United Kingdom. As it stands it is my view that the british people have no say over such matters as the EU, as all three major party's are in favor of it. All i ask for is a little democracy, somethng that our soldiers, sailors and airmen are fighting for throughout the owrld.",
