For example, Sweden's 8 million population have a Swedish language edition. I have just witnessed the UK edition (for 60 million population) and it is completely American in its spelling; Welcome Center, Color, Program, Favorites, Security Center and Personalize are examples.\nOnce this is introduced into schools, a whole generation will grow up assuming these are correct spellings for this country.\nPlease ask Bill Gates for a specific UK edition.",
