        "background": "Afflecks Palace is an alternative, world famous shopping centre, and is the heart of Manchester's Northern Quarter. The company that owns the building is now planning to re-develop the building or to increase the rent dramatically for the existing stallholders.\nPeople come to Manchester from all over the country, and all over the world, with Afflecks being a draw in this. It sustains the vibrant youth cultures that Manchester is known for, because the way it is set up allows entrepreneurs to start up there cheaply. For Afflecks to close would mean a major blow to the cultural heart of the city, which must not be underestimated. Even if it were to remain open, a major increase in rents would mean that many of the stallholders would be forced out of business.\nFor somewhere as iconic as Afflecks Palace to close will take Manchester that bit closer to being like any other city, and losing a major part of its identity. We cannot allow this to happen.",
