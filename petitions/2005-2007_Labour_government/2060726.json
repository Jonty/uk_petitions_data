        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The present situation is that, on attaining the legal age for retirement - currently 60 - women are not allowed an enhanced tax allowance. This does not come in until age 65 - the legal age for male retirement.\nCurrently this means that any income over \u00a35035.00 per annum attracts a tax deduction. Grossly unfair in my opinion.",
