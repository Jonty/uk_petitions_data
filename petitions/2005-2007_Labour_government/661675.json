            "background": "I think that we should stop cutting sentences for good behaviour. The only reward an offender should receive for behaving well during their sentence is the guarantee of being let out on time. We should punnish those who cannot behave in prison by extending their sentences until they can learn to behave like a law abiding citizen. By releasing them half way through their sentence we are reducing the deterrent of the threat of prison, and violating the human rights of the victims. It's time to get tough and stop the thug element of society from being in control. Give the power back to the decent folk who don't break the law!",
