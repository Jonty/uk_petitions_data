            "background": "The M25 motorway does not currently have adequate service facilities. In the worst case (Toddington to Pease Pottage) the distance between services is 82 miles, a journey which can take over two hours. Leaving the motorway to find alternative facilities often requires a substantial detour. This situation causes serious problems for families with young children and for the elderly. For drivers there is also no possibility of taking a rest, raising serious safety issues.\n\nThis petition calls on the Prime Minister to develop service stations at adequate intervals around the M25 providing basic parking, petrol and toilet facilities.",
