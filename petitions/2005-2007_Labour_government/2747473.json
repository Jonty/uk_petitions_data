            "background": "It is our view that many of the problems faced by our society stem from the content in television broadcasting before 10.00pm. Television broadcasters are continually increasing the violent and sexual content of programmes shown before young children go to sleep. Children increasingly have a television in their bedroom and therefore it is difficult for parents to control what they watch. Is it not time to put our children first and allow them to enjoy the innocence of childhhod for the sake of all our futures?",
