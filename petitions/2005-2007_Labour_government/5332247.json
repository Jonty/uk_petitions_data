They are horrid and smelly and make people cough.\nThey increase ill-health problems by as much as 100% due to the noxious fumes they blow into neighbouring premises and the lack of skill in cooking dead animals properly.\nThey are far worse than tobacco smoke and the impact is immediate, the animals are killed and then eaten by people who have no consideration for the lovely creatures on the earth.",
