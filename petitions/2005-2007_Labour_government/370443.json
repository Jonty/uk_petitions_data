            "background": "Mr Boulds has been very active in the field of high impact, high yield commercial front-end Internet applications, providing cutting edge solutions to many of the industry's most complex and high profile systems. He has also been active in the promotion of some of the country's most innovative and provocative concepts in women's fashion over the last few years, crossing boundaries of classic haute couture and modern hard-edged freestyle concepts. His greatest impact, though, has been in the realm of animal control, where he has been enthusiastic in maintaining safe levels of animal populations to protect the health of the public and domestic animals.",
