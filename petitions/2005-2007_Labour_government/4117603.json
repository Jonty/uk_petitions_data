            "background": "Every contact I have had with the tax credit authorities has been mis-handled, meaning that despite our full co-operation we have still not received the correct payment year on year since 2003. This has culminated in a \u00a31660 bill . The department for working tax credits cannot establish why we owe this money. The worst of it is - we cannot opt out! I want nothing more to do with this inept and farcical department, but have no choice until my children reach a certain age, or my income increases significantly. This is not good enough, and the bully boy tactics of the revenue add to the stress caused. This system has worsened our family life, not improved it - Scrap it now it is obviously a shambles and needs replacing.",
