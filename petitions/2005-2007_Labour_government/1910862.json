            "background": "On average a person in London for example will only see snow settle twice a year. \n\nTherefore between the ages of 13 and retirement we will only have 104 opportunities to play in the snow.\n\nLIFE IS TOO SHORT.\n\nThe UK population should get an official day off every time it snows so we can enjoy life while we can.  Play in the snow and build snowmen.\n\nWhen it snows the public transport system grinds to a halt anyway, people crash their cars and people DIE.\n\nSo why go through all that stress when we could have just one or two more days off a year to enjoy one of the most basic things.\n\nSo please join me and support the cause.\n\nDavid",
