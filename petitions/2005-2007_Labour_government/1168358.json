            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Too many families are being forced to repay thousands of pounds that have been overpaid in tax credits as a result of the inland revenue failing to act on information supplied. An overpayment of benefit cannot be recovered if the recipient can show that it was caused by an official error.  This appears not to apply in the case of tax credits and it is scandalous that families are being left short of money though having to repay money paid in error by the Inland Revenue.  If a claimant advises the tax credit dept that they have made an overpayment and the dept fail to amend it then people should not be forced to repay the money.  In some cases CCJs have been registered against people for non-repayment.  This is unjust behaviour from a Government dept.  We urge the Prime Minister to deal with this issue as a matter of urgency and stop families from being forced into hardship by the Inland Revenue.",
