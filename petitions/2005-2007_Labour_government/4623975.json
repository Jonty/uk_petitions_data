            "background": "The state of our roads is growing worse day by day. We pay more and more each year for our vehicle license to use the public highway, yet less is spent on the repair of the roads. The cost of claims to local authorities is increasing with the damage caused to our vehicles. The roads are no longer a safe place for motorcyclists either, with so many roads in a dangerous condition. Sign below to support this greatly needed change.",
