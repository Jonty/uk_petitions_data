        "background": "Speed cameras are not really about safety, they are about revenue generation. In all villages cameras should be replaced with speed sensitive traffic lights, approach them too fast and they go to red - \"shoot\" the lights and get photographed and fined. There is no reason why these could not be combined with pedestrian-controlled crossings.\n\nThis approach works elsewhere in Europe, but those countries care about road safety over and above revenue generation.\n\nThen do it in the towns and cities, replacing every revenue camera with a set of speed-sensitive lights.",
