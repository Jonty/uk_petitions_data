            "background": "The United Kingdom should phase out the availability of incandescent lightbulbs (ILs) for the vast majority of uses, encouraging their replacement with low energy alternatives such as compact flourescent lightbulbs (CFLs) and LEDs.\n\nILs are incredibly wasteful, converting only 5% of their energy to useful light.\n\nThe Australian government announced in February 2007 that it would be phasing out ILs over three years, encouraging their replacement with low energy alternatives. The United Kingdom, with three times the Australian population, can have even more positive impact in this regard.",
