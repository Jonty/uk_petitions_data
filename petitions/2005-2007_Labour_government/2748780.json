            "background": "For too long, our career politicians, lawyers and liberal apologists for criminal behaviour appear to have favoured the \"so-called rights\" of criminals rather than the \"real rights\" of their unfortunate victims.\nIf the United Kingdom were to introduce sentences of \"real\" deterrence including the death penalty where appropriate, I am certain that we would see an instant and real reduction in crime figures (without the need for this \"out of touch with the real world\" Government to massage / spin the figures as they are so apt to do).\nI hope you will agree that, whilst this will certainly upset the tax-payer funded social engineers of our society, my proposal does represent an ample measure of plain common sense which will strike a chord with ordinary, hard working and law abiding people.\nIf you agree, do please add your name to this petition.  Thank you.",
