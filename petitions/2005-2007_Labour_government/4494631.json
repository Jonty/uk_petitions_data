        "background": "After deciding to scrap the dividend tax credit in 1997, Gordon Brown's department has been robbing all of us to the tune of \u00a35bn a year. When compounded, it could add up to about \u00a3100bn. This will not only cause me to loose a considerable amount of money in my pension fund, but most other people as well. It could cost the younger generation, who currently pay into a pension fund, up to \u00a350,000.00 throughout their working life.\n\nHe knew exactly what he was doing at the time but never admitted it. And he still won\u2019t.\n\nIf he was in a top company management position he would have been sacked before now for major misjudgement of funds. Time to go Mr Brown.",
