            "background": "The use of mechanical flails is destroying thousands of miles of hedgerows because the operators appear to have no interest in the diversity and quality of hedgerows.  Hedges are cut brutally and the flails often leave an unsightly mess which gives the impression that the hedge has been vandalised.  Principally a 2 in 25 rule should apply in that there should be a target of one immature and one mature tree in every 20 metres of hedgerow. Parish councils should be given the job of implementing the guidelines and ensuring diversity.",
