            "background": "The Khalil family, consisting of mother, father and daughter, have been in the UK for 20 years.  Both mother and father are fairly elderly and are both BLIND!  Their daughter is a talented artist and is about to go to Art College.  The reporter covering their tragic story said that, if they are sent back to their country (Iran or Iraq?) they will either be destitute on the streets or, even worse, imprisoned.  HOW CAN THIS SO-CALLED CARING COUNTRY ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN?  I AM ASHAMED TO BE BRITISH WHEN I HEAR OF THINGS LIKE THIS!  Let all the decent folk in this country rise up and petition against this CRUEL decision by the Home Office.  Unfortunately, I know no further details.",
