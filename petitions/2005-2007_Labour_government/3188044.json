            "background": "Waste is a problem. Charging people on the basis of how much waste they produce will provide clear financial incentives to reduce their waste (reduce is above recycle in the waste hierarchy). The system should allow a flat rate for a reasonable amount of waste (say 60% of the average) with increasingly expensive tiers from then on. Such a system should incorporate a reduction in council tax corresponding to the cost of waste disposal.",
