            "background": "Many people avoid paying road tax and still drive. The governments current scheme to increase tax for larger vehicles is punitive to those who own a larger vehicle out of necessity BUT drive economically and only when absolutely necessary. The ONLY fair scheme is one where drivers pay a single tax based on the fuel we put in our cars. The more you put in the more you pay. This ensures all road users pay, without fuel you are going nowhere. The tax becomes one based on millage/usage, the more you drive the more you pay, simple and easy to collect/manage. Drivers of larger vehicles WILL still be penalized through higher tax but those of us who drive less pay less, a fairer system. Foreign visitors will also then automatically be paying to use our roads, currently they do not.",
