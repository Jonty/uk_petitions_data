            "background": "Nightclubs and private members clubs in the UK have to abide by certain rules that do not seem to cover public houses. For example, strict noise emissions from the premises and security, which are written into their licences. I believe that a pub should BE a pub and that any establishment that wishes to have bands, discos or special events that run after 11pm at night should be re-classed as either nightclubs or private members clubs, and therefore abide by the same set of rules.",
