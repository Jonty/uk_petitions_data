            "background": "Livingstone has allowed the London boroughs  to use their cctv cameras to be used for filming the roads of London,particularly near artificial, incorrectly signposted, obstacles. The subsequent Penalty Charge Notice is purely to augment the shortfall in council coffers.It is obviously blatant misuse of the cameras which were financed and  erected to catch criminals.All that is happening is that they are alienating the law abiding motorist by using their underhand  methods of raising revenue.They are destroying the trust that people used to have in officialdom.",
