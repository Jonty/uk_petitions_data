        "background": "The Government has recently announced that it wants to introduce greater penalties for undertaking on our motorways\n\nThe government is failing to tackle the cause of the problem and thus penalising the effect\n\n3 - 4 drivers occupying lane 2 of a motorway at 50 mph reduces it to a dual carriageway for the rest of us.\n\nAll the people who sit in the middle lane do so staring vacantly out of the front of their cars.\n\nIn the words of one person who I know does it 'I do it so I don't have to think about it'.\n\nI suggest the following\n\n1st Offence: \u00a3 100.00 fine 3 points\n2nd Offence: \u00a3 250.00 fine 3 points\n3rd Offence: \u00a3 500.00 fine 3 points\n4th Offence: \u00a31000.00 fine 3 points & the car is crushed\n\nThis will mean dangerous drivers will either be educated to use the road properly or removed from it and in the process the Government will get more revenue to spend on road safety and will address the issue of congestion thus making journeys shorter and reducing carbon emissions in the process.",
