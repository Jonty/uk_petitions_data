Cut out the red tape and questions such as \"What was your clock number at this mine?\" How can anyone possibly remember such details nearly 50/60 years later. \n\nMost surviving miners are desperately ill and need these funds now to ease their suffering. Why make them suffer any more than they already are? Some of these miners applied over 7 YEARS ago. Give them a fair deal now!",
