            "background": "Unlike in the USA and some other countries, in the UK there is no written and codified constitution. Although the government is elected by the people, there isn\u2019t much that legally prevents the government from doing what it likes during its term of office and, once voted in, the government appears to have unlimited power to impose whatever taxes and laws they see fit.\n\nA written and codified constitution would guarantee that government cannot infringe the immutable rights of the people to self-defence, fair trials and prevent unfair taxation (including \"stealth\" taxes), etc. A smarter approach would be to adopt a codifed written constitution which would \u201cgovern\u201d the government and ensure that ridiculous laws would not pass such as those allowing criminals more civil rights and liberties than their victims or the imposition of stealth taxes.",
