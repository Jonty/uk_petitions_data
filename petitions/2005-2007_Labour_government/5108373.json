I have heard people ring in and give answers which I can see plainly see in the word search grid they are showing only to be told the answer wasn't correct. 615 people have called the show in the last minute according to the caption and yet only 4 people have been answered in the last 3 minutes. These programs should be banned from the airwaves. They make millions from people with virtually no chance of getting the prizes and prey on the poor and vulnerable (and the drunk on a friday night). Thank you for your time",
