        "background": "The current system of CE marking, and other regulations is a minefield for a person who wishes to start out selling a product. Product testing at approved labs can be very expensive. \nThe government should create a free scheme to help first time inventors/startups to get products (especially simple ones, like electronic projects, not very large scale designs!) tested and approved for CE marking. Help and advice on the confusing subject should also be available, preferably at regional centers.\n\nThe scheme should be open to all people who have produced a working prototype or viable idea that they are capable of producing, and are stuck at the CE marking / testing stage, who can prove they are unable to afford the normal testing route (ie no previous products selling in bulk,no large turnover).\n\nBring back the ability for the people of the UK to invent and make products! It should not be just large corporations or the rich that can create products,lets stop stifling progress, and start innovating!",
