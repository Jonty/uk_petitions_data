            "background": "Every year thousands of healthy animals are killed (put to sleep) in UK animal shelters and dog pounds after they have served their 7 days after being handed in or caught.  \n\nThere is no national database of unwanted or homeless animals to help owners locate their missing pets.  \n\nCouncil policies of whether to kill healthy animals are made on a local basis and there is no national agreed consensus. \n\nKilling healthy animals who are waiting for a home is wrong and should be banned.",
