            "background": "The House of Lords is the most effective legislative review body in the World. It does this whilst still being appointed. This is due thanks to the great experience of its voting members who come from many areas of expertise and use this to help guide and reform legislation.\nAn independant committee comprising equal members of both the Lords and Commons should be created to recommend people for the Lords directly to Her Majesty for approval.\nThe House of Lords should be appointed by numbers in each area of expertise, whilst selecting the best candidate in their field for the job. \nThis will give the UK the most effective, expert, and representative body possible. As such the rules of Parliament should be amended to give the House of Lords equal status with the House of Commons, and to end the nonsense of primacy of the House of Commons by placing both houses on equal footing in all legislation. Equally the Parliament Act sections used to force through legislation should be limited to national security issues only.",
