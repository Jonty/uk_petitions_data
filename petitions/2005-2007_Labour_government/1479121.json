            "background": "We just spent, well we still are spending,billions on a war we shouldn't be in, se we could certainly afford to re-regulate the buses and subsidise them to point of being virtually free and far more comprehensive in cover. A few thousand buses driving around London,say, all day long beats several million cars crawling along burning fuel and getting nowhere!\n\nThe money we currently pay into speeding fines and other,lets face it, punative measures could be better used in subsidies. \n\nA virtually free and geographically comprehensive public transport system with very costly taxation for people who still insist on driving would work.\n\nStand beside a train line anywhere and see how few trains actually travel on it ! Freight should be put back onto the trains with financial insentives for companies who put freight on trains and barges.\n\nConsecions of course. Disabled drivers who rely on the car. Couriers who carry from LOCAL distribution hubs and so on.",
