            "background": "We are asking for a reduction on the cost of traveling by public transport. It is going up every six months when NO improvement can be seen.\n\nA couple of examples are bewlow:\n\nI get the train to work everyday of the week. The trian is either late in the morning or afternoon or even both. This is every single day. My ticket price has gone up by \u00a320 in the last 9 months. It would be alot cheaper to drive to work and pay for parking every month.\n\nI had to go upto Manchester the other day and it was going to cost me \u00a3250 by train or \u00a3150 by plain. I took the car and it cost me \u00a370 round trip.\n\nYou will only be able to get people to travel by public transport if it is inproved and the price comes down.",
