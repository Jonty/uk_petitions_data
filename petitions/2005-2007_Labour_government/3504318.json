            "background": "Whatever happened to curly endive? Where do I go to purchase a nice sturdy cos? If I want to add some colour to a salad with a nice fresh rossimo, where do I look? Who can I turn to? Okay, so if I supported local shops rather than do the no-brain zombie-run like everyone else, maybe more greengrocers would still be around, each supplying their own unique variety of lettuces; but I\u2019m as lazy as the average shopper, and the grocers are sadly long gone. So what happens? I end up shelling out two quid for a gas-filled bag containing some measly scraps of the old lettuces I once knew and loved, that will last a day or two and then very rapidly begin to resemble the contents of a flu-sufferer\u2019s nose. Why are those of us who take pleasure in a nice varied salad forced to purchase these smelly, overpriced, non eco-friendly bags? Are there really not enough of us left in the country to warrant a good mix of green and red leaves on the shelves, rather than bagged up and drowned in nitrogen?",
