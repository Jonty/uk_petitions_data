            "background": "We have the most untidy roadsides, a result of our disposable society and the reduction in the provision of adequate rubbish bins. The main cause of the problem is the large amounts of plastic waste generated by soft drinks bottles which are not biodegradable. this reflects badly on the image of the country and its citizens as well as causing a long term environmental problem . The proper cleaning up should be funded by the suppliers.",
