            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Speaking as a taxpayer I find it incredulous members of the Royal Family are allowed to join the Armed Forces when the possibility of their deployment to an actual war zone is negligible.During the Falklands crisis,HRH Prince Andrew ,already serving as a helicopter pilot was deployed and not a word was said other than to congratulate him on his courage and fortitude.However the attitude displayed towards HRH Prince Harry & in all probability HRH Prince William is more that of of an overprotective mother hen.By not letting them see some real service are we not presenting an image to the world of  \"playboy princes?\".One wonders whether either of the Princes would have seen active service in Northern Ireland had the \"troubles\" not been resolved.Its almost certain that they would not have gone to Bosnia/Serbia.\nIndeed HRH Prince Harry has stated that if he is not allowed to serve his country ,then he would rather not be in the Army at all,commendable words from the young prince.I say let them make their own mind up and then agree to be bound by that decision.",
