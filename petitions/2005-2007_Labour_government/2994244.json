            "background": "I work shifts as a nurse in Derriford Hospital. This means I leave work late at night in the dark. We are encouraged to use public transport but the bus I require leaves at the same time I finish work. Nursing is such that we cant always leave on time and this means I have to wait an hour for the next bus in the dark and cold. When I do get off the bus, I have a very dark unlit lane to walk down to get home, past a drug and alcohol rehab ubit. Very frightening. I have approached First Bus and got nowhere so I am asking for your help.\nI really want to help the environment but this is forcing me to use my car for safety issues.",
