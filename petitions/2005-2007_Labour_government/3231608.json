You are already paying for the service they provide, yet they take even more money off you when you need to report a fault in their service! They constantly use 0800 numbers to net their catch and then force you to pay premium rate 0870 and 0845 numbers thereafter! This amounts to robbery! We need to stand united and force these companies to climb down. This practice is nothing more than corporate greed.They have got away with this practice for far too long.",
