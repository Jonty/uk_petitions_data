            "background": "Our prisions are overflowing, our armed forces are under manned, anybody who faces imprisonment for crimes committed should be conscripted for at least twice as long as their prison sentence.\nInstead of sitting in prison cells watching television, learning from other inmates on how to become a better crook and becoming couch potatoes.\nIt would also make these people think twice before commiting social crimes, it would teach them respect, authority and personal pride. \nThey would be forced to respect their country, learn a trade and become self sufficient without having to prey on their own kind.\nThis would also save the country funding more prisons.\nIt would build up our armed forces.\nIt would clear our streets of scum.\nIt would reduce our prison population.\nAbove all it would give these people pride in themselves and make them useful members of society.",
