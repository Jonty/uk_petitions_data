            "background": "The DCA is responsible for running one of the most important departments. The Courts Service. In a new way to pay people the treasury wants to enforce regional pay on its staff. This will mean that people in the Civil service in different towns outside of london will be on different rates of pay for doing the same job. We believe this is unjust and will infringe on the Human rights of staff with disabilities and caring responsibilities as the people with caring commitments and disabilities will not be able to travel to earn extra money. we ask the Prime Minister to get the treasury to check this pay deal to make sure it is it does not discriminate against any group of employees in the DCA",
