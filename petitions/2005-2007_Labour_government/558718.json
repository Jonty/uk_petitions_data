            "action": "committ to progressively electrifying the National Rail network, and to ensure that only electric trains operate along electrified sections of line as quickly as reasonably possible after electrification; and furthermore to ensure that an ever-increasing percentage of electricity used for rail travel is from renewable sources.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "We are all aware of greenhouse gases emitted by internal combustion engines, so why are many of the country's rail lines operated solely by Diesel trains (eg:Great Western and Midland Main Lines)?  By filling holes in the electrified network (such as Hayes & Harlington to Reading, Ore to Ashford International and Gospel Oak to Barking) there will be a base for expansion of this system.\n\nBy pledging to electrify, lines\u2019 futures will be safeguarded, and by running trains that rather than generating their own power, draw it from the network, and use regenerative braking, the whole system would be more efficient.\n\nDespite statements by some train operators, running diesel trains onto electrified lines as a through service (eg: Ashford International-Brighton) does not deliver the same benefit as electrification: diesel trains never accelerate as well as electric ones, so journey times are extended, or stops missed from the 'enhanced' through services to keep time.",
