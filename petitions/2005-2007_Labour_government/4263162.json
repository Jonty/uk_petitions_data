Also it infuriates me how we are barred from many responsible jobs (fire service, aviation, railways and electrics to name but a few). I understand these jobs hold a lot of responsibility for people's lives but if colour code systems were abolished and fairer systems brought in then the system would be fairer to us and we could do the jobs some of us want so much",
