            "background": "Telecom operators are posssessed of draconian powers 'Code Powers' under the Telecommunicatios Act 1984 (Sch2) & Sch3 of the Commuications Act 2003. In practice these powers are not used for essential network protection for the public but to seek and enforce contarctual advantages over Landlords. This is wrong and unfair. It is wrongly applied legislation and unecessarily supports monopolistic practices. The balance can be rederessed by a simple repeal of Sch3 of the 2003 Act (which give blanket protection to operators) and replacing it by a prior obligation application to OFCOM who can apply a test of 'reasonable necessity' (with an onus of evidence on the operator) for the use of the protections the Code permits. If refused the operators must be have the same and any other property tenant.",
