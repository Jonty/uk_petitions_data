            "background": "sadly in england today the police very seldom tackle child abuse after someone reaches 18 years old - due to the very nature of child abuse the abused seldom report what happened to them as chuildren until they much much older.\n\nPrior to 18 they only get involved when soclail services ask them to.\n\nfor the huge rate of figures of all forms of child abuse please see www.nspcc.org.uk\n\nthese figures seldom show up on police crime figures\n\nchild abuse is not tackled in england it really is not - it has to be tackled now hence why just given 1 week to get as many signatures as possible\n\nplease sign and pass on as quick as possible the pm needs to act asap \n\nhopefully soon all countries of the world would have signed international anti child abuse legislation",
