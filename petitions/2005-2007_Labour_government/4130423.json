        "background": "The  Motoring wishes to suggest a simple amendment, viz: \"All vehicles used in a place to which the public have free and open access must be RTA compliant and carry a registration plate, unless they are participating in an Approved Event.\" An Approved Event is a licensed motorsport event - car or bike - and already covered under current legislation\nif such an amendment is not included in the Bill, the future of motorcycle sport in Britain looks bleak at best, with a maze of bureaucratic red tape for racers, custom bike builders and museum owners. At worst, the five-page Bill would wipe out motorcycling as we know it.",
