And they all share one thing in common: They feel helpless to do anything about it. Marches, demonstrations and the lobbying of political leaders has, until now, been largely ineffectual. The real reason for this failure is that, in truth, governments wield very little power in a world driven by market forces and material values. It is time for governments now to have a greater say in matters of world poverty set against the West\u2019s lust for wealth.",
