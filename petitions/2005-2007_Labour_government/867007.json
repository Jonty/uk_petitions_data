        "background": "Taxpayers' money is being used to bolster  Microsoft's monopoly position in the office suite market by teaching children from an early age only to use Microsoft Word. This practice also wastes money buying licenses when there are free office suites available, such as OpenOffice. If schools switched to using and teaching open source software, more money would be freed up to pay for teaching staff. Students would also not have to pay for proprietary software to continue their studies.",
