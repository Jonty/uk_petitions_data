            "background": "Raise roughly the same amount of tax as now but using a much lower rate. A low rate, but wider base. So VAT would be 10% (not 17.5%) and would apply to all services and sales. Pension funds, charities, private houses and non domiciliaries would pay tax for the first time but only at 10%. Inheritance Tax would be 10% but on the whole estate and no exemptions for businesses or farms. A Social Security tax of 10% on earned income. Stamp Duty and Council Tax 10%. The very low paid and disadvanteaged would be Tax Exempted (Zero). The main purpose of a low flat tax is not to cut expenditure but to simplify collection and save on the cost of the collection burden of personal income tax and social security with the economy receiving a substantial boost as a result.",
