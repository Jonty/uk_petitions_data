        "background": "Currently, landlords are able to let houses that have no insulation, insufficient heating, and immersion heaters. This results in extremely high energy bills for the tenant, and the pollution of the environment. The fines for this should be so high, that it prohibits the landlord from letting the house if he does not do something about it. Landlords should also be prohibited from charging \"extra\" rent for energy-efficient homes. A decent energy rating should be a matter of course.",
