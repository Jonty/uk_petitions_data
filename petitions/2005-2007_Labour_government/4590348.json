            "background": "We the objectors believe this project to be poorly planned and ill advised by a company who aren't experianced in the adverse effect of such a large turbine so near to residentual properties.\nWe believe this turbine would be poorly sited and a gross waste of public and private money.\nWe also believe that the noise from this turbine would be very detrimental to the residents in properties near-by and to wild-life,especially at night.\nThe turbine site is within 200m of residential houses and we believe this is completely the wrong position for a wind turbine.\nThere is also strong feeling that when the sun is setting a strobe lighting effect will be produced by the motion of the turbine.\nWe also object to the way the Planners appeared to completely ignore the local residents concerns on the high noise levels omited by such a large turbine.",
