            "background": "The mayor is toiling with the idea to bring in a banding structure for London banding vehicles under certain categories, which in itself is not such a bad idea. I myself as a builder drive a Transit type van, this he proposes to set in the same banding as 4x4 jeeps which currently stands as the highest levy, rumour has it around \u00a380.00. Now this is criminal, ok I agree with regards to the big 4x4 driving around the centre of London and there is no need for it but innocent people who are trying to earn a living will end up paying, how can I add these charges to my already cut throat industry ? .",
