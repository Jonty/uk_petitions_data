            "background": "Moving the Houses of Parliament and the Prime Ministers house to Sandown beach on the East coast of the Isle of Wight, has many benefits. To begin the PM\u2019s wouldn\u2019t be able to work during high tide as they would have to evacuate to prevent getting their expensive suit\u2019s wet (during high tide all of the PM\u2019s papers and documents that were left in the building would get soggy ). Other benefits include being able to construct, in the Brownfield site were the house\u2019s of parliament used to be, a monkey enclosure. Of coarse the greatest benefit will be seeing all the PM\u2019s heading out on the water on their boogie boards when they\u2019ve finished work at 3pm to show the public that they do have some talents, even if they don\u2019t lie in politics. My final plan is to replace the cafeteria in the houses of parliament with a small jail where politicians who have been especially stupid or bad can be locked up to think about what they\u2019ve done. This will mean that the PM\u2019s will have to find lunch elsewhere such as the  \u2018Driftwood Beach Bar and Grill\u2019",
