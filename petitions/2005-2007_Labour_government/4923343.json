            "background": "I am fed up of having to pay ADULT prices for my CHILDREN who are aged 12 and 15. Legally they can't work full time, drink alcohol, get married, drive, use a credit card so why are we charged adult prices. We are encouraged not to take our CHILDREN out of school for holidays but not only are prices increased dramatically during school holidays we have to pay ADULT fees. The Government needs to decide what age adulthood begins either 16 or 18 and this should be standard for everything and then we will all know where we stand.",
