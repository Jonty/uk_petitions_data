            "background": "53,000 Britons changed names in 2006. Many are criminals trying to escape their criminal records. Soham killer Ian Huntley slipped through the net in 2001 when he applied for his school caretaker's job under the assumed name of Nixon. Sex offender Timothy Cuffy stabbed a 13-year-old girl to death in 2002 after changing his name to Barnett to escape Probation Service monitoring. If a person has a criminal record they required to report their name change to the police but a spokeswoman for Deed Poll UK, Britain's largest name-change company, said criminals often don't do this.\nWe call for a permanent publicly accessible register of deed poll name changes and a legal requirement for all name change registrars to update each and every name change to this register to prevent this loophole being exploited by criminals",
