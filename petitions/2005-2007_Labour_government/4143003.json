            "background": "As a parent of an 'angel baby' I am disgusted at the lack of care and respect given to parents by the health service and other agencies when a baby dies. You cease to come under the care of many agencies and end up in limbo. If your baby has to have a post mortem you are left to wait for months before getting results and an inquest adding to the already unbearable pain. The resources for counselling etc are limited and many rely on SANDS (stillbirth and neonatal death society) and other charitable organisations for help and support. This is a charity and without these and other charities many parents would have nothing. I also ask that NHS midwifery staff are given better training so that so many babies do not die needlessly every day. 18 babies a day die in our country, that is 18 families who will suffer the worst possible devestation imaginable. I implore you and your health ministers to do everything in your power to deal with this heartache.",
