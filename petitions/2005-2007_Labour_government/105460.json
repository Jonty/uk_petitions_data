            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Dear Mr. Blair, LHR is Europe's busiest airport but we cannot afford to allow it to stagnate. If you give the BAA no money to build a third runway at Heathrow, which is necessary to cope with growing traffic, it will stagnate, and - as the British Airways company has recently stated - millions of jobs will be lost, while funding the enlargement of Heathrow would generate a significant growth of Great Britain's GDP.  We therefore ask you to do so, and to award some money to the BAA to expand Gatwick and Stansted, also to cope with growing traffic.\n\nAllow us to inform you that if you ignore this petition, Frankfurt International Airport will overtake Heathrow as Europe's busiest, as will Paris's Charles de Gaulle Airport.",
