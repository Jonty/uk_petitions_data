According to British Waterways, there were 300 million individual visits to the canals in 2005 and we are deeply concerned that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has seen fit to reduce British Waterways\u2019 grant by some \u00a360 million over the next 5 years and that of the Environment Agency by over \u00a320 million in this financial year. We believe that these cuts will have a devastating effect upon the well-being of inland waterways and put at risk many urban regeneration projects.",
