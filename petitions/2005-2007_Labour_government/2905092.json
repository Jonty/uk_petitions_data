            "background": "The Public pay councils to take away their rubbish by way of  the Council charge. We pay for a service and if that service is not carried out in full why should we pay that part of the Coouncil Charge. The Public should not be told by the council what they will and what they will not take. Nobody employs someone to do a job and lets the employee tell the employer what to do?\nWe are told to separate paper in one box, glass in another, and most councils will not take cardboard.\nIf we are doing a job for the council by sorting bottles in one box and paper in another they  should pay us and we should also get a percentage of the profit the councils make selling the recyclable glass and paper!\nADDRESS THE REAL ISSUE MAKE COMPANIES STOP SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS WRAPPED IN PLASTIC OR CARDBOARD AND STOP PASSING THE RESPONSIBILITY ON TO THE PUBLIC!!",
