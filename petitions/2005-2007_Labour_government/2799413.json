Most of the petitions on here contradict each other, which make drawing any conclusions almost impossible. Politicians won\u2019t listen to the petitions, as they don\u2019t represent a true cross section of voters, just who can put on the best PR campaign. Why can\u2019t we sign up to disagree with petitions, or have the ability to make comments and have a proper debate?  \n\nThis site is a massive waste of time, distracts from the real issues out there and should be shut down. If the Government really wants to encourage electronic democracy then replace it with a site where people can vote for or against a suggestion and give their reasons why.  Alternatively use the space to host a video of Tony Blair standing on his head juggling ice cream and the lyrics to our new national anthem, \u2018Gold\u2019 by Spandu Ballet.",
