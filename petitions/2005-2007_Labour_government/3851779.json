            "background": "The Royal Navy has suffered massive cuts in personnel and units during the period of the present government. We now are reduced to little more than relying on the Americans for our defence and enforcing our responsibilities in international waters. It is probable that the UK could not now mount another successful taskforce (e.g.)in defence of the Falklands. We need a fully functioning fleet ( including the two new carriers to be built ) in order to protect British interests and British people wherever they may be. If these cuts continue we will be left with nothing more than a coastal defence force in an increasingly unstable world.",
