        "background": "The children's index is a database of all children living in the UK. This database monitors virtually ALL family activities such as how much fruit and veg a child eats for example. \n\nIf 2 or more concerns are flagged up about a child who is on this database then social services will come knocking at your door. The system in this country for so-called child protection is bad enough without feeding it further. Children could get bruises for many reasons such as physical/sensory disabilities or even worse certain illnesses of the blood. Are these parents going to want the stress of being falsely accused of abuse if their child's illness has not yet been diagnosed? NO THEY ARE NOT!\n\nLETS STOP THE CHILDREN'S INDEX BEFORE IT STARTS. \n\nFreebird",
