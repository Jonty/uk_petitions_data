            "background": "In the U.K, there are many different exam boards for the main qualifications of GCSE, As and A-level. By nationalising the companies than set the exams, a unity can be brought among the sylabuses. In addition, these companies charge the government \u00a320-\u00a340 for entering each exam, and by nationalising this, the government shall take some of this cost away, allowing more children to take exams, and increase the qualifications of a nations youth.",
