            "background": "Gwent NHS Trust have just increased their car parking charges to an exhorborant level. All staff have to join the scheme and have nearly ten pounds taken out of their salary  month. Although we pay 120 pounds a year this does not guarantee a car parking place and more often than not we have to park on streets outside hospital sites.Most of the sites have no security on site and they just come to the site to clamp cars and then have to be contacted to remove the clamps which take them up to four hours to turn up.This delay comes after working a very hard shift where you cant wait to get home to relax. Relatives and patients have also got to pay 1.50 pounds per hour to park. some people visit everyday and this adds up to a lot of money to see someone who is ill in hospital.\nThe nhs is running a scheme to cut down on stress but they impose charges which increase stress levels greatly.\nPlease add your name to this petition because if gwent nhs get away with it other trusts will follow suit.",
