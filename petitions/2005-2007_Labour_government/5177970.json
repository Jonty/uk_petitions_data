        "background": "petition:\nPlease do not interfere with the English language, its not the governments job and never has been.\n\nreasoning:\nThe English language is and always has been a rich language because the dictionaries are written based on how the language is used. This has produced a diverse language. If the government  start interfering, even if it's just for slang like McJob then it marks the beginning of the corruption of a beautiful language.\n\n*ironically I was never very good with my English,( some would say the education system is to blame, i think i was just lazy but meh), but please consider this petition on its merits not on the quality of its wording.",
