            "background": "Stop targeting GPs (General Practitioners) for performance related pay, or QoF, which was not only long over-due, but was supposed to be voluntary. We are being bullied by the Government (pay review) and PCTs (more interested in United Healthcare etc.) under whom our contracts are continuously under threat, if we do not give in to bullying tactics. If GPs were to breakdown every item of work they did, much like lawyers, the Government will not be able to afford us.  We still work on what's best for the patient and in many areas we continue to work for 'free'.  Private finance initiatives will ruin the NHS and cost the taxpayer a lot more money than we as GPs, in the long term.  Would the tax payer like to cough up \u00a3400 to repair a light bulb under PFI?",
