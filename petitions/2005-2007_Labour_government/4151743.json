To represent Britain as a dynamic, forward looking country, we should adopt a new \"Open Era\", or OE. The Epoch used should be that of Unix, 00:00:00 UTC, 1st January 1970. The term Open Era not only recognises the origins of the epoch with the Open Group, but also the open access to information that typifies our times.",
