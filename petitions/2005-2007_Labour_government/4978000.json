            "background": "The current calculations of edible fish stocks, in the North and Barents Seas are based on weight. This ignores actual populations. \n\nThe recent nature of Cod stocks, for example, indicates that there are large numbers of immature and undersized Cod.\nSuch a phenomenon may be related to LACK OF FOOD!\n\nCurrently, Sand Eel fisheries are destroying the marine ecology, which supports the lower Marine Food Chain, which in turn supports the Food Fish population, on which the EU markets depend.\n\nTemporary Sand Eel Fisheries Bans, ALWAYS results in an explosion in food fish populations!......... but political pressure also always reinstates the fisheries!\n\nThe depredation of Sand Eels also seriously affects our Marine Bird populations.\n\nThe fishery is used entirely for the production of fertiliser!",
