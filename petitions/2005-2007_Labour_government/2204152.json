            "background": "With minor modifications, diesel engines can be run on vegetable oil such as rape seed oil. However, the government levies a tax of 48.35 pence on a litre of vegetable oil used as a fuel for motor vehicles, making it an uncompetitive alternative to diesel fuel. \n\nThis petition requests the removal of this tax to increase the use of vegetable oil to power motor vehicles, thereby:\n\nReducing carbon emissions\nReducing expensive oil imports\nHelping local farmers",
