Racism has been cracked down on in the last 10 years to such an extent that it is no longer \"baa baa black sheep\" we sing of. When will homophobia get cracked down on?\nGay, Bi, Lesbian and Transgender people need more rights. Far more rights than they are getting. Homosexuals are not vermin, Homosexuals are Human thus should be treated this way. Homophobia in school should be clamped down on and homosexuality should be adressed more in schools. We live in 2007 not 1807.",
