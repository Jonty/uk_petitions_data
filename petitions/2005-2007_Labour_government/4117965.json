            "background": "Currently, the Off-Road Vehicles Registration Bill has passed it's second reading. \n\nAlthough primarily aimed at the nuisance caused by mini-motos, which are already illegal to use on the public highway, the bill in it's current form will require all motorcycles to be road legal and registered whether they are to be used on the public highway or not. Because the bill doesn't not differentiate between motorcycles used solely off the public highway; i.e. racing machines, off-road machines, museum exhibits and personal collections; and illegal use of non-road legal motorcycles on the road, it runs the risk of decimating the motorcycle racing industry, the off-road motorcycle industry and many motorcycle museums. \n\nI/We therefore urge the Prime Minister to reconsider content of the Off-Road Vehicle Registration Bill in it's current form before it passes to the stage of tghe third reading.",
