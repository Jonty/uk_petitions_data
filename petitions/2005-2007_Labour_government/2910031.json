        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "In Staffordshire about 20 care homes for the elderly are due to be closed due to the need to cut costs.  Across the UK there is already a shortage of quality nursing home provision for the elderly resulting in many having unreasonably long stays in hospital whilst they wait for a place to live.  As the elderly population increases we need more care homes with nursing care for our elderly not homes being shut to save money.",
