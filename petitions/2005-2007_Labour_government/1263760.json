            "background": "The historic event of Live Aid, July 13th, 1985 where Bob Geldof spearheaded the campaign to raise funds for famine relief in Ethiopia. Billed as the 'global jukebox', the main sites for this event were Wembley Stadium, London (attended by 72,000 people) and JFK Stadium, Philadelphia (attended by about 90,000 people), with some acts performing at other venues such as Sydney and Moscow. It was one of the largest-scale satellite link-ups and television broadcasts of all time: an estimated 1.5 billion viewers, across 100 countries, watched the live broadcast.\nThe final figure raised was \u00a3150 million (approx. $283.6 million). \nYet so much more can be done.\nIf a major event was held every 4-5 years to continue the cause which is ONGOING as well as raise funds to support the make poverty history campaign, I am sure the benefits will be appreciated by all.  \nI also nominate 07/07/07 as the date for the first concert.",
