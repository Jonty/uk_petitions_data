            "background": "Dogs are a great public nuisance and detrimental to public health and welfare. They cause injury and sometimes death, whilst their filth is not only disgusting to the senses on pavements and in parks and open spaces, but also a significant health hazard. Apart from a very small number of working dogs, which would be granted exemption, dogs are quite unnecessary and have no place in a modern urban world, which should be for humans; those who wish to embrace neolithic standards by living in close proximity to animals must be prevented from requiring other people in public spaces to do likewise. Dogs should be like knives - permitted in the home, perhaps, but not in public. And if a dog cannot be given appropriate conditions entirely within the owner's habitation, then it should not be owned at all.",
