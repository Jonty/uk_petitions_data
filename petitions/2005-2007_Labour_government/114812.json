            "background": "Many foods on sale have additives which other countries regard as harmful and have therefore restricted, additives for which there is no nutritional need, and additives that are dubious, if not directly proven to be harmful.\n\nThis petition requests the Government to research current practice in Europe and USA and to use this evidence to promote a bill restricting the use of such additives in food.\n\nThe premise should be that food in it's natural state is best, unless there is a clear and overriding need for the additive and no health risks (on the balance of probabilities).\n\nThe Act should also prescribe a consistent labelling scheme.",
