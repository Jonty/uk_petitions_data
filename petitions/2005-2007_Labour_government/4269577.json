This simple prevention message is not clearly visible in typical waiting rooms, yet there is adequate material available to surgeries.\nThe simple message that \"prevention is better than cure\" needs to be emphasized in waiting rooms.  Encouraging informative and interesting health videos for patients to watch should reduce stress and encourage a positive attitude to health.",
