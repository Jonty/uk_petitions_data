            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Large supermarkets have perverted the Sunday Trading laws by creating shops smaller than 3000 sq ft, which allows them to stay open as long as they like on a Sunday. This has made a bad situation worse. Small, independent shops are rapidly dying out because they rely heavily on Sunday just to stay in business. The introduction of the size restriction was their last bastion of hope and now even that doesn't protect them anymore. I propose that the law be changed so that the size restriction applies to the total shop space owned by the entire company, not just that of individual shops. I believe this change would make the law closer to what was originally intended since the loophole was surely an oversight. Please bring back the community spirit.",
