            "background": "This government has closed more rural post offices and is about to see more closures, whilst also degrading the lives of rural people. Since new labour came to power they have closed many rural post offices which in most rural communities are a life line. They have also seen more rural bus routes stopped then any other government. Rural living is fast becoming ancient history in this country as people cant afford or cant continue to live outside the big towns. \nMr Blair reverse your policies on rural england before rural england ceases to be.",
