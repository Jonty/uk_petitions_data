            "background": "Does the PM read these petitions?  If he does, will he do more than simply acknowledging peoples' views?  After all he 'acknowledged' that the majority of the population were against the invasion of Iraq - but he went ahead  anyway.  These online petitions should not be used as a fake tool for democracy, the population no longer swallows these PR stunts.\n\nI petition the PM to act according to the wishes of the majority, not just the rich and powerful.  Some examples - do not replace trident, do not invest in nuclear energy, ban vivisection on scientific and moral grounds, end the slaughter of innocents in other countries, end the unhealthy relationship with the USA.  Stop putting economic development and business interests before the needs of the planet.",
