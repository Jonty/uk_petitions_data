        "background": "Paganism has been one of the oldest, if not THE oldest religion in existance. The main aim of our religion is the respect of nature. that encompasses all of the natural world. Not just the plants and trees and animals, but also people. we also are tolerant of peoples right to worship under other religions, yet we continually have to endure the deriding comments of others. These comments come mainly because many people don't understand paganism and see it as a bad thing, without trying to find out what we are about. \nThe only thing we try to achieve is harmony with the world in which we live. \nAfter all Paganism is the only true uncorrupted religion, and that is the real reason we are hated so much.",
