            "background": "In 1967 the Marine(etc) Broadcasting Offences Act was introduced to stop the proliferation of radio stations\nbroadcasting from outside territorial waters. These radio stations had a profound impact on the success of the British music industry at the time and I feel that their loss has, over the years, led to a blandness in popular taste today. They have never been effectively replaced by the BBC or by the commercial stations. Some of these radio stations still exist today in obscure ways and with limited audience access, eg on the internet or satellite. Now that so many changes have been made regarding radio licensing and the medium waveband is no longer so well used, can we assist them to come back please.",
