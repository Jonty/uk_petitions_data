            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Most European countries, the USA and Canada require that a vehicle driver must carry their drivers license with them when driving. This has the advantage to the police that they can immediately identify any driver they stop, saves police from writing tickets requiring you to produce your documents at a police station, and would be a big deterrent to people driving while banned or without a license.\nRequiring people to carry their insurance documents would enable police to identify uninsured motorists, and thus provide additional deterrent effect.",
