            "background": "As the population lives longer, the numbers of over 65 year old people will rise over the next 50 years in the UK.  This government and previous governments since the 1960's have slowly but inexorably abdicated responsibility in stages, to pay for care of the elderly in line with RPI inflation.  This is not only wrong, but immoral.\n\nThe working and able has a duty to protect the old and vulnerable in their autumn years, so that they can live outside the poverty trap, with dignity and in relative peace.\n\nTherefore, for this reason, I propose that all tax payers and employed people from all walks of life agree that an additional 1p of personal income tax be levied and specifically allocated, measured and controlled through the National Audit Office, for the payment of benefits to the over 65's including \n\nHigher Winter Fuel Allowance,\npension increases above RPI each year,\ndisability and other benefits, and\na \"Sinking Fund\" for other contingency needs for the over 65's.",
