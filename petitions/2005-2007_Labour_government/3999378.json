        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Although people in this country have the right to gamble, the government should ensure that people cannot use credit cards to pay for their stake in UK casinos and online gambling and therefore run up huge debts. If they restrict people to using debit cards then they can only gamble with the money they actually have! They should also be compelled to use system that check with the bank and do not allow people to exceed their overdraft limits.\n\nIt won't stop people loosing all of their money, but it will stop them getting so badly into debt.\n\nIt will also stop casinos and online gambling sites from exploiting peoples debt!",
