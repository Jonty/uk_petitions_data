Why don't the people who put this bid together underwrite the extra costs that they failed to inclued in the bid. If this was a private venture heads would roll and the project would be closed. This silly amount of money spent on a few overpaid \"performers\" with ego's the size of the world could be much better spent on heath and pensions for british people who have worked for this country all their lives",
