            "background": "The tax credits system actively encourages many people not to work and therefore to not contribute to society. The system is abused and is a huge waste of public funds and should be abolished. The size and cost of the benefits system needs to be reduced so as to minimise the growing dependency in our society of free handouts from the government. \nMembers of our society will be encouraged to become more responsible about there own lives instead of relying on the state. It will help encourage individuals to actively seek work, take up employment, gain confidence and self-respect and have the ability to be in control of their own lives. It will also help individuals to learn that motivation and hard work are key essential attributes in life and promote people to have a strong sense of well-being and direction in their lives. Above all the community and society will benefit as individuals will have increased responsibility and learn to respect the value of money and respect one another.",
