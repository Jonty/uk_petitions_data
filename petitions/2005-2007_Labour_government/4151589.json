        "background": "This is a counter-petition to one which advocates exactly what I'm urging the Prime Minister to resist calls for.  In my opinion this is an extremely selfish petition; if what it asks is put into effect people in the poorest sections of society would become even more disadvantaged in order to benefit people who least need this benefit.  No one has any control over who their parents are or what their financial situation is; the children of people in a beneficial financial situation (and, yes, I DO include those who could afford to buy their own homes in this; neither my parents or I were ever able even to contemplate this) would have had a better childhood (on at least a material level) than those whose parents were not in this situation so why should they benefit again after their parents' death?",
