            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Bringing your dog to work is becoming quite common place in American workplaces (where appropriate - ie: an office, not a building site). Both independent studies and employer inhouse studies have shown that the allowance of dogs to accompany their owner to work has increased general office morale, a sense of well being and more importantly for the employer, it has actually increased employee productivity (due to the increase in overall well being). There are always employees scared of, or allergic to dogs etc... These requirements can be taken into consideration and catered for at little to no cost to the employer. Google is a good example of a company allowing you to bring your companion animals to work, while ensuring those employees not liking animals are not infringed upon. I urge the government to research this in the interests of the national economy and then encourage employers to adopt a best practice approach.",
