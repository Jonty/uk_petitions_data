Home workers require a community to work in, but wish to stay local to reduce travel and conduct local needs (i.e attend children). These centres will provide basic work equipment and the technology to work virtually as if in a 'normal' place of work. Social networks can be established, this is one way to encourage 'local' working without the need to travel and pollute the enviroment",
