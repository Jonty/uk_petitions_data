            "background": "With large screen TV's now increasingly common, any digital channels that do not use a high enough data (bit) rate will display a number of artefacts and/or a lack of sharpness when viewed on these larger screens.  For owners of large screens often the only alternative to get a picture quality sufficient for their TV's is to subscribe to high-definition TV (HDTV) services (which themselves can suffer if the data rates used are too low), or buy expensive \"next generation\" high definition DVD players and wait for the programmes to become available on those discs\n\nTo this end digital TV channels broadcasting standard definition (SD) and high definition (HD) television should be forced to adhere to minimum bitrates to ensure a high quality picture quality on all sizes of TV sold.",
