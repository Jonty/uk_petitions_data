        "background": "Reduce the amount the prime ministers claiming so called \"allowances\". There are people out there who need money and need it so much more. Why pay these \"important\" people of society as they are seen so much when the pot the money is in is reducing so rapidly. I think it is about time the likes of the NSPCC dip into this \"pot\". The workers are volunteers and rely on the public to fund the charity. There is only so much that they can do with the funds they have. Even now there are kids being punished, and what for? nothing, absolute nothing. Please sign this petition and help the charities that really need it. NSPCC is just one example. There are many more.",
