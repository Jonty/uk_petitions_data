            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "As the country is looking to bring other restrictions up to the 18 years of age limit then it should do so for driving too. Driving age should be increased to 18 and regardless of age the first two years upon passing your test all new drivers should be restricted to cars with an engine size 1200cc, making it illegal to enhance the performance of these cars as well (speed restrictor or something). It would give the new driver time to learn to drive in a sensible size car and should help to reduce accidents caused by new drivers in powerful cars.",
