            "background": "To reduce the number of road deaths for new drivers, I believe that the size of engine in a car should be restricted to 1 litre maximum.  This should be for learning to drive and for 3 years after passing their driving test, as per the motorcycle law.  \n\nThis would prevent new drivers from driving at excessive speeds on the road when they have not got any real road experience.  \n\nI say all new drivers, rather than drivers under a certain age, as new drivers who have passed their test are still not competent to judge weather conditions, what other road users next moves may be, have not been in a car on their own, etc.\n\nThis makes much more sense than the government ploughing millions into a pass plus test, which still won't slow people down!!!  \n\nLets be sensible on this.",
