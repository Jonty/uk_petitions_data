            "background": "Section 5.2 of the Code for Crown Prosecutors states that \"Crown Prosecutors must be satisfied that there is enough evidence to provide a \u2018realistic prospect of conviction\u2019 against each defendant on each charge.\"  As innocent people falsely accused of sexual assault / rape can be (and frequently are) convicted on the uncorroborated and unsupported word of an accuser alone (no physical evidence is required), this makes the 'prospect of conviction' far more 'realistic', despite the defendant's innocence.  As a result, the CPS, following their own Code of Practice, are highly likely to proceed with a case against an innocent person.  In order to protect the innocent, the code needs to be changed, replacing 'realistic prospect of conviction' with something along the lines of 'realistic prospect of the defendant being factually guilty and convicted'.  We must stop convicting innocent people simply because the current system 'allows' us to.",
