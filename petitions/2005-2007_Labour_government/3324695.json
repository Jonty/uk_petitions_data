            "background": "The current department is unfair and does not work it needs overhalled if it is to do what its there to do. Look at the publisised events where they failed to act or have acted or accussed without any solid evidence as things stand they can accuse you of anything and you are guilty untill you can proove yourself innocent.  The courts are too easily lead by the information they are given by social services and should use their own common sense as there are too many children suffering as a direct result of the lies and unfounded accusations regardless of evidence.  I myself have been a victim of such accusations despite both my children being happy, fit, healthy and always attending school with good grades. So much for Childrens Civil Rights and civil rights.",
