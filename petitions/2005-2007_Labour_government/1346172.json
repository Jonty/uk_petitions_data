        "background": "These packs are to become law on June 1, 2007.  They have proved unpopular where they have been tested. Given the information to be included, I believe they will put people's identities, properties and security at risk. Apart from that they are very expensive and are to be held by estate agents who will benefit despite contributing nothing.  They can hand them out to anyone who asks irrespective of whether they are criminals, time wasters or serious purchasers.  This is yet another stealth tax and will discourage people from selling, thereby pushing prices up even more because it will cause shortages. The packs do not take into account those sellers who are unable to find another property, who are gazumped and have to pull out, etc.",
