            "background": "Income tax thresholds have been increased in line with inflation since 1997.  Given that income tax is earnings related, it is only fair that the thresholds be increased in line with average UK pay inflation.\n\nTo start of with, the thresholds should be increased to what they would have been if the link with pay inflation had never been broken.\n\nThe 40% income tax bracket was and is supposed to only be paid by high earners, but increasing numbers of slightly above earners are subject to this tax.  If the current policy on thresholds is continued then eventually every wage earner will be subject to this level of tax.\n\nThe current policy is alienating a growing number of people and undermining the relationship between tax payers and Government.",
