            "background": "Manchester City Council have refused permission for fitness instructors to train their clients in public open spaces without paying a \u00a3300 licence fee and 10% of the income from such training sessions. Many of these sessions such as Buggyfit classes are run at a loss and do not even make minimum wage for the trainer. The commission is to be paid on revenue, not profit. We believe that parks are there to be used by the public and that the government, both national and local, should encourage their use for the purposes of improving health and fitness without trying to profit from it. We also believe that it is wise to undergo professional training in exercise technique and that parks should allow this use. They are our parks, to be used by the public, not money-making instruments for the local council.",
