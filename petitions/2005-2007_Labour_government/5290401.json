            "background": "My petition to the prime minister is to create a system on the motorways and dual carriages where by at certain times or afterhours you may drive to a speed which you are comfortable without worrying about speed cameras. Drivers have to pay so much to use our roads, such as tax c charge, insurance and so forth, so why cannot the goverment give us drivers back in return. So  Prime Minister, if you want to gain the trust of the millions of drivers within the UK even when you're government continues to discourage us drivers from driving then please give us something back.  Let us be responsible enough to drive at speeds above the mark and we will get along with the ever increasing costs of owning a car.",
