        "action": "Introduce legislation to force Telco/ISP's to adhere to 'Net Neutrality'",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The internet is the greatest resource mankind has ever known. However, ISP's and Telco's are becoming more involved in examining and discriminating the traffic that runs through their networks and putting it under the \u2018Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)\u2019 umbrella. There is however, a very thin line between \u2018acceptable use\u2019 and network bias.  As the internet continues to evolve, the educational and entertainment freedoms we enjoy today may be dictated by financial and political motives from the said service providers and external influences placed upon them. Thus, without the said law we may be driven unwillingly to content which provides the service provider with greatest financial gain or deliver a prescribed agenda. The undersigned want legislation imposed upon Telecom companies and Internet Service Providers whereby they are explicitly unable to discriminate on content or service and still maintain a quality of service by via blank AUP restrictions to specific users.",
