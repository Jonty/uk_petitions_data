            "background": "I believe 4x4 owners should be compensated by the Government for having  their vehicles made worthless, and unsaleable because of the new tax rate for 4x4's. We have paid a lot of money for our vehicles,and this tax is completely unfair and just another way of wringing more money out of car drivers.As for being bad for the environment, our vehicles have to pass an emissions test during MOT's,and won't pass if above recommended levels, and most 4x4's are far better on fuel consumption than a lot of family saloons or estate cars. So those arguments don't hold water !",
