        "background": "I beleive that as the Home Information Pack (HIP) rules currently stand, Domestic Energy Assessors (DEA) do not have to have Criminal Records Bureau Checks (CRB) before entering properties.  I'm concerned that this poses a danger to the public and ask that this is changed to ensure, like Home Condition Inspectors, new entrant DEA's are required to have an adequate CRB check before starting work.  If this means a delay to the start date of HIPs in June, then rather that than some child being harmed.",
