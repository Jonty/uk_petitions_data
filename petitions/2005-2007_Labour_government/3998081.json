            "background": "Currently problem householders can make as much noise as they like and we as neighbours can do nothing about it except: make a record of the noise for 6 months or more, then apply to the council for sound recording equipment to record the noise, then take the matter to court; a very lengthy process. In the meantime we have to suffer interrupted sleep, intimidation and the stress that goes with it. Our rights to enjoy our  own homes peacefully is taken away and our quality of life suffers. In addition, we are required to notify future buyers of our houses if the neighbours are troublesome; we cannot even take the drastic action of moving away! Therefore we request that the police are enabled to deal with noisy neighbours instantly and effectively.",
