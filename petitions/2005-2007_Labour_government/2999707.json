        "background": "The policy on inclusion for childrem with special needs into mainstream is a blanket policy, with no account taken for the range of disabilities and levels of support needed. Mainstream school cannot cater for such a vast range of needs, by wrongly moving children into mainstream it will invariably result in the closure of special schools due to lack of pupils through reduction of statements despite the rise in children with disabilities.",
