            "background": "All citizens need health impact information that they can understand if they are to make good choices when purchasing food. The Guideline Daily Amount (GDA) system is in my opinion superior for those who can use it. For example, if I see that a chocolate bar contains 20% of the GDA for saturated fat I am much less likely to eat a second bar on the same day than if the label carries just a red traffic light, one of many traffic lights on products consumed that day. GDA information helps to explain why a product has a red traffic light (whether it has a high saturated fat content or high sugar, for example) and  it is impossible to put together a balanced diet using only traffic lights. Sadly the reason why the traffic light system is required is that the UK education system produces so many citizens who cannot handle percentages.",
