        "background": "Historian, scientist, photographer, writer and broadcaster, Dr Adam Hart Davis is one of most recognised people on British television today. \n\nHe is also one of the most talented. \n\nIt is hard to know where to start with his achievements. He is probably best know for his presenting work on many successful and popular educational series, such as 'Tomorrow's World', 'What The Romans Did For Us', 'Local Heroes' and 'Science Shack', presenting history and science with tremendous enthusiasm, and in a very informative and interesting way. \n\nWe feel that he should be recognised for his services to educational broadcasting.",
