        "background": "David Beckham, seems like a nice enough guy, nothing against him personally. Talented footballer? Certainly. Underachieving footballer? Definitely. Why then a candidate for a knighthood? In a word, celebrity. He has done nothing in his chosen field other than be good-looking while doing it, creating a culture of fame over talent and achievement. Where is the substance in this? What would we be rewarding? This would be the final nail in the coffin of a nation that once prided itself on endeavour and valour. A fitting emblem of the Blair years.",
