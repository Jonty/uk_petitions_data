            "background": "Just like London and what they are planning in Manchester, i have heard they are planning to do congestion charges for Bristol as well. I beleive this is not needed and is a another way to get money out of the hard working public. We already pay our taxes and they should really find another way to stop people using their cars or even more ways to encourage people to share cars through Bristol. All the Government need to do is change other things to improve the congestion. For example things they could do is put up car park prices for the centre during office hours week days and reduce on weekends.",
