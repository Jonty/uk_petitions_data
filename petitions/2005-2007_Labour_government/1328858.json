The BBC should be made to attract company sponsorship/advertising to  attract revenue.  Why, when a high percentage of people now pay for 'other' providers should we also be forced to pay for a further compulsory licence.\n\nBasically, the BBC have an open check book sponsored by the licence fee, paid for by UK Citizens and enjoyed free of charge around the world.  Force the BBC to have Pay per View, or voluntary subscription to view.",
