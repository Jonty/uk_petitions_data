            "background": "This would restrict foreign transport companies taking advantage of our punitive diesel taxation, reduce congestion on main routes, reduce accident statistics due to the current transport modes, and almost certainly increase taxation receipts to the treasury. This should be considered to be a cost matching exercise for UK companies, and Rail companies would benefit from greater revenue allowing better maintenance and development.\nA further benefit could be achieved by reducing the Duty payable on diesel fuels, thereby encouraging the use of a more environmentally friendly use of domestic vehicles alike.",
