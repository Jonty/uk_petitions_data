            "background": "The current political activity supporting reduction in carbon emissions by the introduction of legislation to enforce it is un democratic and pursues a view on global warming that is not universally accepted by eminent scientists. It also puts the UK at a disadvantage in respect of businesses having to incurr expenditure that competitors overseas avoid. It also puts a burden on the domestic population that increases costs and restricts choice. Whilst it may give British politicians the moral high ground the results will do nothing in practical terms when compared to the three main areas of industrial pollution, namely USA, China and India.",
