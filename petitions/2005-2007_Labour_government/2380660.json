        "background": "We recognise that we have to do something about congestion and climate change.  Road charging may be part of the answer.  But like other 'green' taxes it will lose credibility if the public think it is simply a way of raising MORE tax overall.  So we ask for a matching reduction in fuel duty so that motorists are fairly treated.",
