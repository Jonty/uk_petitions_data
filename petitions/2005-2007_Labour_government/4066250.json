            "background": "At present vast areas of wharehouse/factory roofing and Council Estate Housing have not been utilised for use as a source of electricity and hot water/heating, due to cost. This Government already gives grants to homeowners for solar panels, if extended to both businesses and local authorities, vast amounts of cheap electricity could be generated, prices of solar panels would fall allowing even more home owners to purchase them, becoming environmentaly freindly, cutting even more emisions and lessening the need for more nuclear power stations or carbon fueled power stations.",
