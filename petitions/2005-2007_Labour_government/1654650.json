            "background": "Scooters generally do around 70 - 100mpg and can carry up to 2 people (3 with a side car), add to this the fact that they do not cause any conjestion. During the week, most cars on british roads have only the driver on board, yet they take up about 9 times more space on the road than a scooter, and do about 1/2 the mpg of a scooter, therefore abolishing road tax on scooters would go some way towards encouraging more people to use them for suitable journeys.",
