The Chancellor's money-spinning stealth tax has soared by nearly 50% in a year, with buyers in the South East of England bearing the brunt.  \n\nThe Current Rates:\n0% up to \u00a3125,000\n1% for \u00a3125,001 to \u00a3250,000\n3% for \u00a3250,001 to \u00a3500,000\n4% over \u00a3500,001\n\nWith house prices increasing faster than income, stamp duty tax is simply unfair.  This petition proposes to scrap paying the government just because we buy a house.",
