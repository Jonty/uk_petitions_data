            "background": "The undersigned believe that it is wrong for companies to use premium rate lines when customers are reporting faults actionable under the sale of goods act. Companies generating revenue off such callers are acting out of the spirit of the act and deterring customers from making legitimate complaints. Often times companies provide poor service by other communication means (such as free ones - e.g. email), in order to effectively force customers to phone premium rate lines. Additionally companies often take a long time to process these calls and include long, chargeable, hold times for transfers. We ask the government to legislate against this to maintain the spirit of the Sales of Goods Act. Consumers should not need to pay in order to action their rights.",
