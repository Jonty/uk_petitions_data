        "background": "We would like the prime minister to stop charging students from the channel islands 'overseas' student university fees and to allow them to pay the same amount as if they were from the UK mainland. Not only do we have to pay up to three times the amount that students who live on the mainland do, but we also have to pay far much more money to get there, as we only have the choice to fly or sail.",
