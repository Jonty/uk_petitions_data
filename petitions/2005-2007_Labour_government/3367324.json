            "background": "The 10 per cent rate of Income Tax is a burden on low-paid employees.  The marginal rate of many claimants of tax credits is already in excess of 60 per cent, with some facing a rate as high as 70 per cent.  The abolition of the 10p rate would help low-paid employees, pensioners and provide everyone else with a tax cut of at least \u00a3200 a year.",
