            "background": "I have this week received a tax demand, following submission of my online self assessment tax return, for the paltry sum of \u00a30.28. The paper this was printed on; the envelope it was delivered in; the return envelope; plus the postage cost render this uneconomical to collect. Added insult is the threat of interest being charged should I not pay this within an unspecified timescale.   \n\nAs an IT professional, I am more than aware that sums falling within certain parameters could be automatically written off via suitable software programming. Indeed, I am aware than many financial institutions operate such a policy relating to financial transactions such as insurance premiums. \n\nWhilst this would incur costs initially in development and testing, such costs would be recouped in the short to medium term by means of reduced production and associated costs.  In addition to which credit balances falling within the same parameters would offset debit balances.",
