He has had to pick up the pieces from a certain swede and the only thing he's done wrong is listen to the media. Let put the emphasis on the under performers picked such as gerrard, lampard, robinson and ferdinand. They play fantastic week in week out yet can't perform when they put the three lions on. Playing for your country is no longer an acheivement they expect it!",
