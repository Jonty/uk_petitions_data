        "background": "Some of the petitions listed on this site are blatantly anti Christian and at the very least anti faith. As an example they call for the prohibition on teaching creation as fact but do not acknowledge that evolution is a \"theory\" and not fact. We would ask for balance in society that allows various views to be outlined in schools rather than a single view dictated and for protection for the rights of Christians to exercise their faith openly, without prejudice and without persecution. This extends to the upholding of others rights such as Muslim rights, other faiths rights, gay rights, etc whilst the rights of Christians are progressively undermined.",
