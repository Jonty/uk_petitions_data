            "background": "The Government advocates climate change levies on various day to day activities on the UK taxpayer as well as encouraging recycling. However, the ongoing conflict in the Middle East is likely to have produced and is continuing to produce significant greenhouse gas emissions, thereby negating any small changes we may make as ordinary citizens. The taxpayer has a right to know how much the war has and is contributing to climate change ie the volume of greenhouse gases emitted and the type of gas in the production and use of weapons and the resulting fire and smoke pollution.",
