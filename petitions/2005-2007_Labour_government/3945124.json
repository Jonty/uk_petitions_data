The EU's Measuring Instruments Directive (that came into force October 2006) requires the UK to phase out the Crown symbol and replace it with the Conformite Europeene (CE) logo.\nWe the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to allow the Crown symbol to remain on our pint and half pint glasses, along side the new CE logo, to retain this small but relevant link to our nation's heritage whilst still conforming to our EU obligations.",
