            "background": "Great Yarmouth....  The clue is in the name.  If Greater London and Greater Manchester can be cities, then why not Great Yarmouth.  Great Yarmouth is a town(city) of great regional, national and international importance.  It is thus a disgrace that the government stump the growth of Great Yarmouth in the international business community and as a location for tourism by not giving it the recognition or importance it deserves.  The lack of city status has allowed Wally Windmills to close and the boat to be removed from the McDonalds restaurant, tragic events that surely could have been avoided otherwise.  Do the government not know this is the home of Anna Sewell?  I thus urge the government to bestow upon Great Yarmouth the title of city, thus making it a culutral and creative centre for generations to come.",
