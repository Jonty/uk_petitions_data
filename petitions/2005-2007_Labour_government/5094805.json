Start to own public transport as we invest in private companies we may as well own it, then own the garages to service the above and so on so making the country stable & making it easier to lead by example, i.e. using greener fuels, and even if government companies just break even the stability of jobs would help the economy no end. eg the companies would be British gas, B.T. Rover, British Leyland, stagecoach etc. buying shares in some & reserecting others",
