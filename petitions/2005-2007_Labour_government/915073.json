            "background": "Rick Costello has been campaigning on Five Live to get the winter fuel allowance extended to cover the terminally ill.  He has cancer, with only months to live and he said he couldn't afford to heat his home.  (The nature of his treatment causes him to be more aware of the cold) \n\nHis point is that thousands of people with critical illness appear to be affected - because they're not pensioners, they don't get the allowance.  \nHaving heard his story I have started this petition and would urge others to support his cause.",
