            "background": "The current rates of APD are:\n\nEconomy class flights in Europe, internal UK flights - \u00a310\n\nBusiness and first class flights in Europe - \u00a320 \n\nEconomy class long-haul flights - \u00a340\n\nBusiness and first class long-haul flights - \u00a380 \n\nThese figures represent a 100% increase on the rates in force prior to the 1st February 2007.\n\nDefra launched a consultation on a Code of Best Practice for the provision of carbon offsetting to UK customers on 18 January 2007. The aim is to have an operational Code of Best Practice in the Autumn of 2007. \n\nAs the premise for the increase is to reduce aviation emissions and the amount of revenue is directly proportional to such emitions, it follows that the most ethical way of spending the increased revenue is on carbon offsetting projects.",
