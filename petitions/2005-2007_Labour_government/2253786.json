        "background": "There is confusion both in the public mind and in government between these quite separate and distinct issues. The amount of CO2 in the atmosphere is tiny - 0.04% It was 10 times that in the Cretaceous, when chalk was deposited as the earth's response. The earth will continue to warm for some 2500 years and will then begin to cool again under the influence of the shortest of the Milankovitch cycles. Successive cycles of changing temperature and sea level can be observed in the cliffs of the Isle of Wight. For 99% of the earth's history there has been no ice at all at the poles. We cannot destroy or even damage the earth; but we can make it uncomfortable for humans to live on. There is a substantial argument that it is not that the footprint of mankind is too heavy; just that there are too many footprints.",
