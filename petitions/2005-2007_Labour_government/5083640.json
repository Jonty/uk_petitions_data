            "background": "I am writing to petition agaist the recently imposed Tax on 4x4 vehicles.  As a caravan Owner I purchased a 4x4 purely for the purpose of towing a family caravan.  In doing so I holiday mainly in the UK this indiscriminate stealth Tax, veiled as a green tax. Penalises those who have chosen to holiday in the Uk and therefore spend their disposable income within the british economy.\n\nLet's not forget that Caravaning an Leisure is a growing industry.  In choosing to caravan I do not travel by air, an acknowledged major pollluter, but politically too sensitive.  Instead I holiday in this country supporting rural and tourist economies.  I like thousands other who caravan also support the caravan industry both nmanufacturers and accessory suppliers.  The Government should consider this fully when making abitary decisions to win votes.\n\nI recall the HGV actions taken in recent years in response to fuel increases and feel as abody we need to make our voice heard. Maybe as a coordinated  body through bodies such as the Caravan Club and the Caravan and Camping Club we need to plan a day of actio when we all take to the road in protest!  Sign up if you agree?",
