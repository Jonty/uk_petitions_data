        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "School secretaries have for too long now been the unsung and underpaid workforce within the school environment.  They are generally highly regarded within their own school, but have little or no respect by outside forces (Ofsted, LEA's and central government).  They have no clearly defined pay structure and many perform other duties as well, with pay being awarded on a purely ad-hoc basis!\nSuffice to say many are mothers themselves, who after having had children, find that they need extra income and that the working times awarded by being a school secretary become very attractive. This is at the heart of where the abuse begins, their need for a working life that fits around being a mother to children, means that pay is not the prominent factor, and subsequently it is not what it should be.\nI request that central government set up a commision to look into and revue the pay and working conditions for school secretaries across all teaching establishments in the country.",
