        "action": "put in place strict repercussions for British manufacturers not reducing their consumption of Volatile Organic Compounds, in line with current EU legislation.",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "A great deal of companies are still using VOC's or ozone depleting chlorinated hydrocarbon solvents, despite the fact that we all know the risks to both the workers and the environment. Trichlorethane was classed as an unsafe product in the 70's, yet can still be found throughout industry. Carcinogenic thinners are used daily in many factories during the degreasing process, yet the companies are not held accountable. The EU is striving to reduce the use of such \"nasty\" solvents and has thus introduced legislation to put pressure on industry. Laughably though, there is absolutely no penalty for non-compliance. This needs to change. There are safer alternatives available to companies. The bottom line is that continued, uncontrolled use of VOC's will ultimately continue to cause needless deaths and depletion of the ozone layer. We owe it to ourselves and the people around us to make sure the EU legislation is actually followed.",
