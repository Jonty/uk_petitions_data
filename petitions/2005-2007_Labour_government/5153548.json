            "background": "Whether or not they are granted Asylum, no reasonable person argues against the fact that most Asylum Seekers arrive from very unpleasant places/conditions. Everyone has a Right to Family Life, but this right is threatened where a child, born in the UK with one British parent, can be deprived of the other parent (where that parent is...or becomes a \"failed Asylum seeker\") by forced deportation. Whilst it is true that, in most cases, this parent may leave the UK and apply for leave to re-enter as a dependent, the timescale for this process is usually many months and inevitably entails excessive separation and distress (or exposure to danger in a foreign land) for these young children. PLEASE GIVE BRITISH CHILDREN THE RIGHT TO STAY IN THIS COUNTRY UNDER THE CARE AND PROTECTION OF BOTH PARENTS.",
