They have all lived in Britain for many years and have family members who are British Nationals. Most are refugees fleeing from persecution. The German government recently secured the release of a Turkish national with German residency following negotiations between Germany and the US. The man is now free, with no restrictions and has been reunited with his family in Germany. We call upon the British Government to make urgent representations to return the British residents to Britain.",
