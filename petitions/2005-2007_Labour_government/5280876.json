            "background": "We the English public are fed up with northeners like John Prescott turning OUR Back Gardens into places we cannot identify with any more.  Flats turning the properties next door into shaded, no privacy dens. The Fauna Trees, Birds ,Mammals ,Butterflies Ponds with Newts, Frogs, Dragonflies, grubbed up who for? We were told in the 70's our population was not increasing. So explain why we need so much housing. A Garden is not a Brown Field site, in fact environmentalists are always telling us how our Gardens help wild life.  The Property, not The Garden is  Brown Land. Make your feelings known we have had enough",
