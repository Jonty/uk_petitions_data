            "background": "Currently trade unions can not take industrial action in support of another trade union's action. This was made illegal by previous Conservative administrations. In other countries, notably on mainland europe, unions can strike in support of other unions. This creates a stronger and more influential union movement, which benefits union members interests and the wider interests of the country (eg stopping anti worker legislation etc). it should not be the role of the law to dictate what actions an autonimous and democratic trade union can take. if a unions membership vote in favour of secondary action in support of other trade unions then they should be able to do so, albeit in the knowledge that as a union, and as individual union members, they are responsible for their actions and decisions and so must be willing to accept any consequences with their employer etc. but they should not be in fear of prosecution under the law.",
