Their internet serivce will be based around the ADSL2+ standard which provides up to 24mbps download speeds. Parts of the UK already have this and it is currently out of date technology. The rest of the world are replacing their copper phone lines with fibre to the home and have speeds of up to 100mbps internet and some parts even have speeds of 1gbps. The UK will lag behind in broadband speed if no fibre network isn't put in place. If you want a future proof network please sign the petition",
