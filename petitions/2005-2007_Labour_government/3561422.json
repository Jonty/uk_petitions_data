        "background": "At present, those aged over 60 or the disabled get free off-peak bus travel, and in certain areas, train and tram travel. However, outside of London, full-time students aged under 18 have to pay for slightly-discounted season tickets, or in some cases the full adult fare. \n\nMany students are working hard to gain a future for themselves and the country and are less financially well off than most over 60s.\n\nProviding a free pass would encourage more students into eductation and remove social barriers.",
