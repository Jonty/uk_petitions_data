            "background": "I believe we have far too many MP's. The majority of these self serving elected representatives at Westminster do not warrant their excessive salaries, expenses, holidays and generous pensions. The calibre of the average MP today is poor as far too many have little or no life experience outside of party politics/trade unionism.  Too many of our so called elected representatives see fit only to represent their party rather than their constituents. The USA has a significantly greater eletorate than the UK yet manages with far fewer elected representatives; there is no doubt our democracy would benefit from fewer MPs.",
