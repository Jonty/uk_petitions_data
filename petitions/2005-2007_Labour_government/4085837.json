What about quality of life?  \nDo you want to walk do the street with the stench of decaying rubbish?\n\nThey are telling us to wrap up our waste to a greater degree.  What are we supposed to wrap up the rubbish with?  Plastic?  Surely that creates more waste and is non-biodegradable.  Please sign and make the government and local councils see sense.",
