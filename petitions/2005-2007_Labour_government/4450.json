            "background": "I believe bringing back national service would help in putting a stop to teenage anti social behaviour, tenage pregnancy and general unruliness amongst tenagers. It would mean at the age of 16, all people unless they were going on to do higher education, would have to take part in a year of national service.  Whether it be as part of the armed forces or work within their local community.",
