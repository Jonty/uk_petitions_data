            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It seems whenever the inflation rate is raised. The Bank of Englands 1st and only maeasure is to raise Interest Rates.This unfairly penalises the home owners who have to come up with extra money to pay the banks who instantly raise their interest rate.All this while savers & non-homeowners are laughing all the way to the bank. We are in danger of loosing our properties while the banks refuse to offer 25 year fixed rate mortgages. The Government should regulate income tax for all if it wants inflation to be reduced instead of giving money to the Big Banks shareholders.",
