All wards should be single sex only to prevent both men and women from feeling distressed and vulnerable.  The stress caused can only make the patient feel worse.  Also, Doctors should consult all patients in private and not behind a curtain where everyone can hear.  GP's do not consult in their waiting rooms!",
