            "background": "Along with withdrawing exams up to KS3 SAT exams, all students up to and including further, should be allowed to elect not to do exams and instead do coursework on each module studied as assessment. Many students dislike exams as they put them under duresse, causing in cases illness and sleep deprivation, which in turn leads to poor performance compared to ability.\nWith the choice to do all assessments as coursework, many students' grade is better proportioned to their ability, as it is more relaxed, more reasoned and considered, and less formal. They can also be proof-read edited if there are errors.",
