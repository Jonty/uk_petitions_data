        "background": "It is only by removing or criminalising the users/abusers of ALL prostitutes that the sex trade can ever hope to be diminished or stoppped.\nNo human being should be degraded in this way and there are many children,i.e under 18year olds being sexually abused/raped, illegally, as prostitutes.The laws as they stand are lenient and will not change the way men,(mainly), perceive women,children, young men and sex unless they are forced to by legislation.The laws have not worked in the past as figures show and it is the vulnerable in society predominatley who are forced into prostitution and no Governmental Projects and Pilot Schemes will stop this from happening on the huge scale it is today.The latest 2006 Home Office Coordinated Prostitution Strategy, Paying the Price, is laughable in its' pontificating and will not reduce the numbers in prostitution.",
