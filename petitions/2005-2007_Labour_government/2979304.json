            "background": "I suffer from Multiple Sclerosis and was in receipt of the higher rate mobility allowance and middle rate care allowance until recently when there was a slight improvement in my condition.\nThe fact is that Muliple Sclerosis is recognised to have good days and bad days but that these days cannot be predicted neither can the severity of its symptoms. The DLA should recognise this through thier decision makers and make the necessary allowances for this and many other conditions. The appeal I am making is that conditions such as M.S. should be totally included as a recognised disability and should not have to meet the stringent requirements of the DLA due to the fact that you can be in and out of thier guide lines on a regular/daily basis.",
