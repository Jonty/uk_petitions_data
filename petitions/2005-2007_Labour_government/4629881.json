            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The western section A272 winds its way through some of the most beautiful countryside in Hampshire; an attractive and interesting drive for motorists and motorcyclist at the weekend, also popular with pedal cyclists. On weekdays it is also heavily used by commuters and huge trucks which thunder along at high speed. This narrow, winding section is unsuitable for this level of traffic and the surface rapidly deteriorates. The resulting noise, vibration and flying debris brings misery and danger to those whose homes are by the road and pedestrian use is hazardous. Signs on the Petersfield to Winchester section warning \u2018High Risk Route\u2019 are merely a challenge to motorcyclists and sporting drivers. Current 40 limit through Langrish and Stroud is too high; most vehicles travel at 45-55 or much higher for motorcycles. 30 limit enforced by average speed cameras would inhibit wreckless, antisocial driving, improve the lives of the local population and reduce the cost of maintaining the surface.",
