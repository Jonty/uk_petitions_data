            "background": "The UK has just come bottom out of 21 industrialised countries in a comparison of children's wellbeing. Over 3million children live in poverty in the UK, and we recognise the terrible effects of this poverty on children\u2019s health, cognitive development, education, and employment prospects as shown in the recent UNICEF report, and the impact this has on our society as a whole. Poverty blights children\u2019s lives. Poor children are excluded from participating in society. They can\u2019t afford school trips, activities, or warm winter clothes, have friends round for tea or celebrate their birthdays. \nChild poverty costs us all, not only children\u2019s futures and their families, but also society at large. We urge you to fulfil your promise which you made in 1999 and ensure this Government makes the necessary investment to halve child poverty by 2010 and end child poverty in the UK by 2020. Lets not come bottom of league tables like these anymore.",
