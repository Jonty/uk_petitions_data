            "background": "We pay 400% (or thereabouts) tax on petrol and diesel on the grounds that this is a \"green\" initiative. (Almost \u00a35 per gallon, of which \u00a34 is tax of various types; i.e. 400% taxation).\n\nHowever, there is no alternative in many cases other than to use the car.\n\nIt would seem that the taxes so raised are not spent on making transportation greener.\n\nSurely the way to do this is to do radical things - perhaps including  decreasing the taxes on diesel / LPG / etc.\n\nWithout schemes like this, these taxes will increasingly be seen as a cynical ploy to extract taxes without losing too many votes - a neat trick, but hardly \"green\".\n\nThis petition asks government to spend the money on \"green\" initiatives like the more radical suggestions above or come clean and abolish the tax.",
