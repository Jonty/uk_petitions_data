            "background": "Our belief is that a two-weekly collection of household refuse will prove detrimental to the environment and to public health and will not be compensated for by more frequent collection of recyclable waste. In addition to the likelihood of black bin bags being left on the street to be ravaged dogs and foxes, it will lead to an increase in the already huge amount of rubbish fly-tipped in rural lay-byes. And overall it's unlikely to save any of our money.",
