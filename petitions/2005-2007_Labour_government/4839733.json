            "background": "My wife and I are in our late seventies and have been married for 57 years and raised three children. My wife took their upbringing conscientiously and was a full time mother which was normal for our generation. We have always taken the view that everything we owned was held jointly. Our Wills specify this as regards our property which is held as tenants in common in equal shares. This recent ruling which states that a non working wife did not contribute to her half share of the house undermines common justice and is nonsensical. If at the end of a marriage, a non working spouse can claim a proportion of the divorcing partners assets on account of her contribution to the marriage, she must have a right to own a share of those assets. The new logic appears to be for my wife to establish her rights by getting divorced. I would add that the  ruling will affect more older pensioners as working wives are now in the majority. We urge you to have the Chancellor attend to this as a matter of urgency.",
