To keep it this way, funding must stay the same or increase.\n\nIf one looks at the Navy, Top Naval officers will have their promotion frozen for the while and up to half of the Navl fleet will be moothballed, to name a couple. All in the name of cost cutting.\n\nThe once world dominating British Navy is turning out to be no more than a Coast Guard.\n\nPlease, please, please, increase Armed Forces funding and do not cut jobs. The Armed forces are very important to the country, lets keep it that way.",
