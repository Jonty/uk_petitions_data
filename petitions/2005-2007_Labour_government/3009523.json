            "action": "withdraw his suggestion of 24 hour hospital working in England to reduce waiting lists while current funding arrangements persist",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Extended operating hours in any hospital ward are bound to increase overtime, contract nursing and utility costs. To follow the Prime Minister's suggestion would therefore lead to health authority budgets running out earlier, with a longer complete shut down of activities before the end of the current financial year. The waiting time target should be abandoned until funding is improved, and extended hours working should only be suggested for health authorities that now have sufficiently large financial surpluses to support this policy. My suggestion to source any improved funding would be a 50% income tax rate, applied at the highest possible threshold level.",
