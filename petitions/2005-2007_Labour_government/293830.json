            "background": "As we all know many youths in our society today are asked to achieve useless \"A\" Levels and then Degrees in subjects that have nothing to do with the jobs they finally end up doing, just to justify their existence.\n\nMy idea would be to introduce the following measures:\n\n1, To invite different business owners to schools on a weekly basis to prepare and teach 11 year olds + for the real world of business, those that show a real interest in specific trades, get to work with them for a day, and get paid \u00a325 + travel and lunch expenses for doing so. \n\n2, Bring back fulltime on-the-job apprenticeships whereby its made up of 75% practical and 25% theory, those that drop out before the course ends, will have to pay for the theory training part of the course , otherwise its free and paid for by the government.\n\n3, Control the amount of apprenticeship training places by introducing quotas to safe guard future jobs.",
