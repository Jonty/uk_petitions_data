So under the circumstances of the climate changing I believe it appropriate that instead of a blazer and suit trousers the PM shall wear unfashionable shorts accompanied by a very baggy hawaiian shirt. Untill CO2 targets have been met our leader should keep wearing his shorts on a thursday as a reminder that global warming needs to be dealt with.",
