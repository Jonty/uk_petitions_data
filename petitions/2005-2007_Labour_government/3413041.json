Once a trial has run its course and a defendant found guilty by a jury of his/her peers then the judges function is complete.  When it comes to sentencing there should be no choice.  Sentences for crimes should be laid down by the people so that every crime is sentenced the same.  For example, every defendant convicted of burglary FOR THE THIRD TIME should face an automatic life means life prison sentence.",
