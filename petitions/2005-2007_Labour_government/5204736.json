        "background": "Taxi drivers provide a public service yet have little or no protection themselves. Taxi drivers can be robbed, assaulted, verbally abused, have their vehicles damages (which are more often then not, their own cars) and suffer the fare dodger. Enforceable laws and regulations need to be put in place to support taxi drivers. Some responsibility for their safety should lie with the 'Rank' they work for. Rank owners should be obligated to encourage support groups or unions amongst their drivers/call centre staff. this matter is growing more and more urgent.",
