        "background": "As an IT Consultant I now spend over 70% of my time cleaning home and small business PCs of viruses and Spyware as well as advising on strategies to reduce the load caused by SPAM on PC systems.\n\nThese people/organisations do not have the technical expertise, time, money or experience to prevent their systems from being compromised.\n\nI therefore call on the Prime Minister to introduce legislation to force Internet Service Providers to scan all email for viruses and spyware before passing them on to their consumers. i.e. force them to supply a 'clean' end product.\n\nI further call on the Prime Minister to ensure the police have the resources and access to the technical staff required to track down and prosecute those responsible for the proliferation of Spam,Viruses and Spyware.",
