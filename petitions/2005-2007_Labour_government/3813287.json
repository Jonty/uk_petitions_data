            "background": "In the UK, there are more than 14 fatal injuries directly related to electricity in the workplace each year.\n\nYet currently there are no mandatory reporting standards governing the electrical safety testing industry, which makes it difficult for businesses to identify bogus or shoddy companies.\n \nRegular Portable Appliance Testing (PAT) and Periodic Installation Testing by a qualified engineer ensures safety, however the current lack of regulation means tests can legally be carried out by unqualified staff.\n\nMore scrutiny would be more effective at improving safety within businesses throughout the UK.",
