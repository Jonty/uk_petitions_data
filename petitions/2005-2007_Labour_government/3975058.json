            "background": "The education authorities have decided there is no need for a sixth form college at Blessed Edwards Oldcorn Catholic College . Unlike many other counties there are no 6 forms in goverment schools across worcester limiting pupils to only a large college in the city or private sixth forms. Therefore pupils are being forced to leave school at 16 and attend college(which can be a daunting place) I am almost certain some pupils would fair better in a smaller environment as not all 16 yr olds are ready for the challenges of a large college. Therefore i would ask anyone who comes across this petition to sign it and help our school get a sixth form. Why should worcester not have the chance to choose?",
