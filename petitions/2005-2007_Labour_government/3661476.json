        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "I propose a new prison built for long term convicted mainland UK prisoners, in the Falkland Islands, with a maximum security wing on South Georgia. It would have great benefits to the UK.  Prisoners rights would be identical, via the internet, family contact would be the same as now, escape pointless, substantial Falklands employment would be created. In case of need, return to mainland UK, via the RAF, would be in 24 hours. Subcontract detention could also be undertaken for other countries, including Argentina, who would welcome the political implication.\n\nDartmoor sends shivers up a prisoners spine.  Goose Green would be a massive deterrent.",
