Whether they are White or Black the problem stems beyond race. It is equal and deplorable suffering that must be ended by the international community immediately. I urge that you yourself participate in this form of democracy so that you allow those in Zimbabwe a chance to one day participate in there\u2019s. Apartheid, has damaged this country and we must do what we can to make those in Zimbabwe not White Zimbabwean or Black Zimbabwean but Zimbabweans as one nation living under a free and fair democratic system of government where justice and peace are at last given to the civilians of this long suffering nation.",
