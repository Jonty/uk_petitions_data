        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Unless the government build of a new network of rail highways (3 of each up fast, up medium, up slow, down fast, down medium,  down slow) which follow all of the motorways and A roads and force rail companies to make fares cheaper, we will not persuade hard core car owners like me to trains. Like the Underground there needs to be a train every 7 minutes from 06:00 to 02:00 to stop people from standing around.  Include the introduction of a national Oyster card to allow for up front & pay as you go travel which can be topped up on line that is significantly cheaper than current rail travel.  It needs to be faster and cheaper for four business people to go from the Midlands to London and back.  4 people can rent a car, pay for fuel, congestion charge and parking cheaper than booking train tickets in advance.  A return journey from Hemel Hempstead to Mansfield over a weekend can take between twice and 3 times as long as by car in each direction.",
