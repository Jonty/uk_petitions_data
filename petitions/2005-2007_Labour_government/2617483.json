        "background": "The USA (and Israel) is again threatening to attack Iran on the basis of their pressing ahead with a nuclear programme.  As with the invasion of Iraq, this is a totally fictitious reason, the truth being more akin to either or perhaps both the USA's insatiable appetite for oil or the threat by Iran to move its oil industry away from US dollars and into Euros.\n\nSuch an attack or invasion would be totally illegal under international agreements and would undoubtedly result in another Iraq-type situation or even worse, which could be catastrophic for Britain and its international relations, particularly with the Muslim world should it participate.\n\nI would therefore ask the Prime Minister to consult the British people by way of a referendum before supporting the USA (or Israel) should it decide to attack Iran.  Only if a clear majority were in support should Britain participate, or even verbally show support, for such action.",
