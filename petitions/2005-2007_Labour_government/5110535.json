            "background": "When an IRA bomb blew up in his hand when he was just 14, Stephen Menary was so horrifically injured that he could have been forgiven for giving up on life.\n\nBut despite losing his sight, his lower left arm and the hearing in one ear, the young Army cadet refused to admit defeat.\n\nOver the past six years he has bravely fought to rebuild every possible aspect of his independence.\n\nAnd now the Government's Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority has decided to reward his dedication - by cutting the amount he will receive because he has learned how to cook for himself and do his own washing.\n\nIn an age of huge compensation payouts - with even convicts pocketing vast sums for alleged infringements of their rights - Stephen has fallen victim to the authority's controversial policy of delaying payments to younger victims to see if they can complete educational courses or improve their life skills. \n\nCICA says that by acquiring his cooking and washing skills, Stephen has done just that and as a result will not now qualify for the full \u00a3150,000 compensation package he was expecting.",
