        "background": "I would like to see a fairer welfare benefits system where those that have paid in, receive a fairer amount if they are unfortunate enough to lose their job due to redundancy or sickness.\n\nIt seems grossly unfair that a person who works and works for years, paying thousands in tax and insurance, and then is un-employed for no fault of their own cannot claim more than the basic job-seekers allowance or incapacity benefit.\n\nI would like to see the benefits system reviewed to ensure that those that pay in get back.  Not long term but long enough that they do not lose their home, etc before finding another job or getting well enough to seek work.",
