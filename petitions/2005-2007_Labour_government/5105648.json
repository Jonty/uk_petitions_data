            "background": "There has been a proposal that canals and rivers in the West Midlands and Staffordshire could become part of a billion pound sell-off by the Government.\n\nCanals are an amenity for many people living in urban areas throughout the country who have limited access to the countryside.  They are rich in wildlife and are enjoyed by walkers, cyclists and anglers alike. They are particularly appreciated by residents of the Black Country who would be unhappy if they were denied access or if the pleasant, almost rural aspect of the canals, were to be destroyed by any proposed property developments.",
