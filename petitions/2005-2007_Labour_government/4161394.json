None of us can imagine what our men must see out there and they are fighting for US so why aren't we doing more to help them?  We feel it is disgusting that these time scales exist and believe that they should be fast tracked or given private medical care as part of the 'joining the forces package'.  If we can't even give our troops private medical care for fighting for our country, then what has this country come to?",
