            "background": "For several years now, the cost of public transport has been slowly creeping up, and is beginning to spiral out of control.  A large proportion of the cost of public transport is going straight into the owners\u2019/shareholders\u2019 pocket.  This seems unfair when we consider that public transport is a basic necessity and that in some areas of transport, particular companies have a monopoly, and can charge, seemingly, whatever they want.",
