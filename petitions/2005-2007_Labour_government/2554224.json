Looking at how people are not put off by cautions and ASBO's.\nIt would be far better to introduce a Boot Camp system and when completed this would not give the offender a criminal record just a mark to allow the police to know he/she had attended a camp. Depending on the severity it could be a two to four week camp. And it must be completed within 4 weeks of committing the offence. The system is far to slow to punish offenders and because of this they re offend prior to attending court.",
