        "background": "Using modern technology, many jobs (especially office-based ones) could very easily be done at home; if not all the time then certainly for certain days of the week or parts of the year.\n\nIf journeys into town and city centres at peak times were reduced Government could avoid some expenditure on upgrading roads and railways.\n\nCommuters could reduce their travelling costs and improve their work/life balance.\n\nEmployers could reduce their office costs and absenteeism due to minor illnesses and caring responsibilities. Many employers have found productivity rises when work is done at home.\n\nThe environment would benefit from reductions in pollution.\n\nMy petition fits into a number of categories inclusing business and industry, employment, jobs and careers, environment, health, well-being and care, science, technology and innovation and transport and infrastructure. \n\nI would like it listed under all these please",
