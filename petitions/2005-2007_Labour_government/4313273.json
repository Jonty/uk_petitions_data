            "background": "From reading post from meny pregnant ladies from across the uk I have discovered that full antinatal care and anti natal classes have been withdrawn from a lot of areas due to costs. This causes meny problems for 1st time mothers who's only option is to pay for private classes which can be expencive so not within everyones budget or rely on the internet. Antinatal classes can provide invaluable advice & help for 1st time mums at a very important time.",
