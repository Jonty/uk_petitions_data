Why can't the government tax the 4x4 cars used in the town that are not needed instead of once again hammering us in the country. We already pay huge amounts of council tax for services that are not as good as in the towns plus we have to cover more mileage to get to work and school so the rise in petrol and diesel costs are high enough.",
