            "background": "Virgin Media customers are set to lose a number of channels such as Sky One, Sky News and more at the end of February. This is because Sky are demanding more than double the previous amount paid to try and supress the competition. This is an unfair sales tactic considering Virgin Media are selling channels to Sky such as Living, Bravo and Challenge. This means that Virgin Media customers will be stuck for an average of just under a year without what are some prime channels, this is because of a 12 month contract. This is an unfair tactic on Sky's behalf as the value of the channels has not doubled in the past year, they are simply pricing themselves out of Virgin Media's reach so potential customers will use Sky instead.",
