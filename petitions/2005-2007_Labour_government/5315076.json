For example,hospital staff are allowed to travel to and from work in uniforms, Doctors are often in civilian dress, visitors to the hospital are allowed to ignore hand wash dispensers. Hand washing is not enforced. Visitors are allowed too much access to hospitals. Cleaning services are contracted out to profit motivated private companies and not properly controlled by NHS managers and nursing staff do not have the authority to control the cleaners.",
