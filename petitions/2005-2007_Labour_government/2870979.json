            "background": "Ever since her marriage to the Prince of Wales the Duchess of Cornwall has endeared herself to the British people. The original decision to appease the politically-correct Diana worshipping lobby that she should only be styled \"Princess Consort\" upon the Prince of Wales's accession to the throne therefore seems increasingly outdated. This ridiculous decision should therefore be abandoned as soon as possible, and it should be announced that - like every other wife of Kings in British History - Camilla should be styled Queen.",
