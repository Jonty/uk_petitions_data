        "background": "Many people in the UK for reasons of snobbery or genuine confusion, claim to live in a certain area when they do not. Some people have are mistaken about where the boundaries of areas lie, particularly suburbs in the cities.\n\nNormally this does not matter - if people wish to pretend they live in an area they don't for whatever reason, that is up to them.\n\nHowever it is clear that some Estate Agents are engaging in misrepresentation, amounting to fraud, in advertising a property as being in an area which it is clearly not in order to increase the asking price.\n\nWhere a property is on the borders of an area or where the person may not be familiar with an area, there is the potential for people to be misled into thinking they are buying a property in an area they specifically wanted.\n\nIt is hard enough task searching for suitable property without the Estate Agent sending you details of properties which are clearly outside the area you specified, but claiming they are in that area.\n\nLocal councils should define boundaries and publicise them on a website, and Estate Agents would then have no excuse to represent it as being in an area it is not. If they do legal action taken against repeat offenders.",
