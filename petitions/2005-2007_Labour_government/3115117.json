            "background": "Horses should not be raced when they are only two years old as their bones are not fully mature or strong enough and they have a lot of problems in later life because of this. The whip should also be banned, if nobody used a whip then it would be a level playing field. Whips are not used on other animals, it is considered cruel, and so it is cruel to whip a horse to make it run faster just so it can earn more money for its owner, trainer or the punter who bets on it.",
