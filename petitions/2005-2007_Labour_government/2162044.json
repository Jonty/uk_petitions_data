We should break ties with the E.U. and become stronger economic allies with the U.S.\nThe U.S. would not be a replacement for the E.U., but a more viable alternative!\nWe are losing our identity as a nation and our closest links have always been with the U.S. and should remain so. We stop funding Europes' bureaucratic nonsense and concentrate on our own nations shortcomings.",
