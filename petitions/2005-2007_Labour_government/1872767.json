Although there are 2 bridges in the town, at present only one is a viable option for crossing Lowestoft and that is the Bascule Bridge. Lowestoft NEEDS a third river crossing, in the summer the town comes to a standstill whilst the bridge is opened for shipping. It can take upto 50 minutes to travel 1.5 miles. PLEASE help the residents of Lowestoft and build a third crossing NOW.",
