            "action": "end the allowance of poorly behaved students into the sixth form and to abolish the rule that 6th formers can only be excluded for their grades NOT their behaviour",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "In all 6th form colleges/schools across the UK, poorly behaved students are allowed into the 6th form even because they have achieved 5 A*-C grades at GCSE. At GCSE a student can be excluded for their behaviour in school, but not for their grades. At A-Level a student can only be excluded for their grades NOT their behaviour. Which leaves many students having their lessons constantly disrupted by pooly behaved students. Surley if behaviour becomes an issue in the 6th form, the students place at the school/college should be reviewed, as it is not fair on the students who want to work to have their lessons constantly disrupted by delinquents. Although the badly behaved students are achieving pass grades, this does not allow them to halt the learning for other students within a class.\nIf students want to stay in school they should behave in an appropriate manner without an effect on other students learning.",
