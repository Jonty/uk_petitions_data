            "background": "We argue that the existing community of Upminster, Cranham, Hornchurch and Corbets Tey will be adversely affected by the unnecessary development of the area boarding Ockenden Road, Sunnings Lane, Harwood Hall Lane, Aveley Road, Bramble Lane, Dennises Lane and Stubbers lane. This area is under request for compulsory purchase and subsequent re-development, removing the Greenbelt status and blocking several public footpaths and many wild nature reserves, the homes of thousands of wild animals.\n\nWe put the point that there will is a lack of social and economic infrastructure to allow for the prospective residents of the new site.  Local schools are already over-subscribed and an additional influx of residents will not help the situation.  \n\nThe planned development is in contravention of the Governments local planning laws as it is of greenbelt status, the removal of which would be going against a pledge made by the government \u201ckeeping Britain\u2019s green areas\u201d.",
