        "background": "We all know that Britain requires more housing and we therefore need to build.  What seems to have been forgotten though is that people deserve to live in comfort and safety.  I  would therefore like to propose that a drastic review be undertaken to restructure minimum building regulations to improve the 'quality' of new housing rather than just quantity.  I would like to see a redesign of minimum standards to include items such as;\n\nKitchens that are of suffcient size to accommodate modern conveniences such as dishwashers, washing machines and freezers.  \n\nOff-road parking should be provided at a ratio of 1 space per 1.5 bedrooms (not including the garage).  How many of our roads are desperately congested even on new developments thanks to the under-provision of parking?\n\nThere are many sensible and practical suggestions but the limit of 1000 words does not give room for listing them all.\n\nThe answer is always cost.  I say put quality of life before builders profits",
