        "action": "grant an amnesty to all illegal immigrants and close the UKs borders to ALL new immigration for 5 years",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Illegal immigrants come to the UK ostensibly to improve their lives. No-one knows how many illegal immigrants there are - that's the whole point - they are secret, hidden away and often frightened and being taken advantage of by unscrupulous others. This being the case, an amnesty would allow them to apply for temporary work permits and they can then be allowed to work legally - thus paying tax and National Insurance. They will then be contributing financially to the country which has taken them in - the UK. Presumably they will be willing to take jobs as that is what they came for. They will learn more about the way of life here by working amongst the wider population, and improve their grasp of English. Closing the UKs borders for 5 years would allow our groaning and overstretched NHS, education and social service systems time to recover.",
