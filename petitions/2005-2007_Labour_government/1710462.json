            "background": "Firstly, this is not a pro-labour petition in any way shape or form, and before continuing it should be noted that there is no presumption that Cameron is any more or less irritating that any other member of parliament or the government. This petition is intended solely to prevent newspaper stories such as \"David Cameron is a really good dad\", \"David Cameron is so cool because he identifies with today's youth\" or \"David Cameron claims David Cameron is a really nice bloke\" We the undersigned also encourage David Cameron to either come up with some policies or to just accept that his party is largely unelectable and retreat into obscurity without burdening the public with constant soundbites about how cool and nice he thinks he is.",
