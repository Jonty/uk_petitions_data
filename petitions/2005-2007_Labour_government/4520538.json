Often only a letter to a paper or TV program gets this sort of thing resolved, and if you aren't one of the lucky few these disputes can drag on for months or even years.\n\nThis corporate incompetence and apathy causes a great deal of distress and upset, as much as noise or environmental pollution, and the companies that cause it should be made accountable for their actions with statuatory fines of a magnitude designed to encourage them to treat customers with the respect they deserve.",
