This increase will allow nurses sufficient time and resourses to provide quality holistic nursing care, rather than the basic essentials.  Patients should have nurses who are able to spend time with them, allowing their psychological and social needs to be attended to.  Nurses, when were you last able to spend quality time with your patients?",
