            "background": "Even with BT's huge investment in the new 21CN England will still not be ale to offer the potential broadband speeds appearing in America and Europe. In order for England to compete in the future the government and Ofcom need to encourage and even financially assist with the installation of fibre cable into every home in the UK. This would lead to the most enviable communications network on the planet. At present we're trailing boh America (Verizon) and Europe Swisscom and this has to stop.",
