            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Airport expansion will destroy peoples homes and countless historic buildings. Not to mention disrupt local residents and create noise over urban areas! \nRather than displacing 1000's of people around Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted. It makes more sense to build a new airport where no one will be disrupted, at the expense of nobody's quality of life! \nThe government say we need to expand airport capacity, but this shouldn't mean ruining the lives of thousands of ordinary people! Building an airport in the Thames Estuary would solve the problems of current airport expansion and would reduce noise pollution for people around airports. Other major cities e.g. Tokyo have gone down this path and never looked back. What's stopping London and and the south east from doing the same. Sign this petition if you don't want to see your area ruined by airport expansion, if you want to retain countryside heritage or just like a quiet nights sleep. Sign this petition if you want to do whats right .",
