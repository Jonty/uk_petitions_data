I along with others have been fighting for some time to get a sensible solution for well known East Head to ensure the future protection of the village of West Wittering which will be under threat.  East Head is a jewel on the south coast enjoyed by many and will no doubt disappear because of the 'new' approach.  There is no place for apathy anywhere in the UK as this current 'do nothing' policy of government threatens all our low lying coastline, the local industries and most importantly, the people.",
