            "background": "As more and more migrants enter this country it is becoming increasingly difficult to find fulltime employment, thus forcing many to work for employment agancies.\n\nIf the government insists on letting more and more migrants reside here then they should accept that it is nearly imposible to find a job without it being through an employment agency.\n\nI proppose that all agancies should have to pay paternity pay as many people rely on it yet cant get it because they work for an agency (which means they are already on a lower wage and entitled to fewer holidays and not being paid national holidays)",
