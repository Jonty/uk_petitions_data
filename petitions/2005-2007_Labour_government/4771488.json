            "background": "Most if not all equal opportunities questionnaires do not include a question asking sexual orientation.  Equal opportunities policies include sexual orientation in their policy but forget to include a question to monitor it.  \n\nGender, age, religion, ethnic origin, disability have legislation put in place to stop discrimination on such grounds and so too does discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation.\n\nBut only sexual orientation is missed out of the list of questions.\n\nSome people seem afraid to ask the question.  But people can actually choose whether to say gay or straight or bi-sexual.  Failing that they can also say that they prefer not to answer.\n\nHow can sexual orientatation be a part of a policy but not monitored?  It does not make sense.",
