            "background": "The British Olympic Team represents the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Our athletics association is correctly named UK Athletics, but our Olympic team is branded Team GB, with Great Britain the name displayed on all team clothing and merchandise.\n\nThe United Kingdom was formed in 1801, and the British Olympic Association in 1905. The name Great Britain has been incorrect from the outset and should be changed to the United Kingdom.\n \nOur nation has people from many different origins, and sport is one way to unite us. There are over 1.5 million people in Northern Ireland who understand that Team GB misrepresents them.",
