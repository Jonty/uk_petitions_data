            "background": "The government is planning to give council tax inspectors powers of entry into our homes in order to assess our standard of living. Council tax levels will be assessed by wholly unfair measures such as how nice the view is from your bedroom window, whether you have a new kitchen, how close you are to a good school and general home improvements. I believe that this invasion of our homes is both unnecessary and unjust. Councils should be urged to reduce spending, rather than resigning themselves to the fact that their bills will always increase, and searching for new ways to squeeze money out of an already over-taxed nation.",
