            "background": "We are at a broadband turning point in the UK. So many fast home connections, with ADSL2+ becoming more and more aailable, and so few backbones; this is going to become a problem sooner rather than later!\n\nI propose the Prime Minister look into extending fat-pipe connectivity across the board, and specifically to IP ranges dedicated to news and technology websites (for example, HardOCP, ZDNet and other such news channels).\n\nA solid broadband base is required for this country's expansion and we need to retain our position as a world leader in technology and innovation; for this reason I propose action on the PM's part.",
