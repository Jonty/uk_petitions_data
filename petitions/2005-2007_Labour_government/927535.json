        "background": "Many households would like to contribute more to recycling only being restricted to public transport find it almost impossible to do so.\nI propose more facilities be made available, especially in areas where local authorities seem to be dragging their collective feet. To whit glass, paper etc recycling be available on every street corner or every hundred houses. Thus those without transport can make their contribution and local authorities can tailor their collections to pick up points when they become full thus increasing efficiency.",
