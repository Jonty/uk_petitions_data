Now the banks are talking of introducing charges of \u00a3150 per year to run accounts. Now I didn't ask for my wages to be paid into the bank and unemployment doesn't stretch to funding \u00a312 per month so help by saying NO to the banks greed and help people , the aged,the sick,and disadvantaged to help themselves.",
