            "background": "This 10 story development to replace the old Paymaster Generals building, rejected by Crawley Borough Council and the Independent Planning Inspectorate has Ruth Kelly MP insisting it goes ahead.\nIs no consideration being given to the feelings of the local community and its environment? Development is one thing but craming such a building into an already crowded area cannot be for the good of Crawley. Keep Government out of local affairs and allow the local elected council make its own local decisions.",
