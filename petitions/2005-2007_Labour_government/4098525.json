        "background": "When an incinerator is foistered onto a community it is often quoted that the burner will generate enough electricity to run a small town. Well let it. Give all the power created freely to all people within the area blighted by the incinerator. This will help offset the fall in property prices and the extra fuel they will burn in heavier local traffic.",
