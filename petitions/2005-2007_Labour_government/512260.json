            "background": "A large number of government and public bodies advertise jobs in The Guardian and none of the other broadsheet newspapers.\n\nLike the other broadsheet newspapers, The Guardian is well known for promoting certain political views and attacking others.  These job ads mean that taxpayers who oppose The Guardian's political stance are forced to pay for it to be printed.  I believe this is unfair and undemocratic.\n\nNowadays, there can be no justification for paid advertising for the vast majority of these jobs anyway, except for a small minority of posts which call for specialist qualifications and experience.\n\nI therefore propose that in future, all public sector jobs be advertsised on on a central government website and in Job Centres only, with the exception of specialist jobs which may occasionally be advertised in trade and professional body publications.\n\nNot only will this be fairer, but it will also save the taxpayer a significant amount of money.",
