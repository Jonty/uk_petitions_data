        "background": "Red watch is a website which seriously violates human rights. It discriminates people protesting for the rights of anyone who is not British and white. The web site shows pictures and details of people who \"threaten\" their ideals, many of whom have been targeted in a disgusting manner. If you look at the website you will find perfectly ordinary people in protest marches protesting against the war in Iraq and for that they are now a threat to our society. If such information is allowed to be published then isn't in direct conflict with our supposed right of freedom. Please sign this petition to make it well known that this is the case and hopefully such information to be published publicly should be strictly monitored or in an extreme case (which i favour) to be made illegal.",
