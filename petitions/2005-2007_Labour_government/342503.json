            "background": "Having been a commuter now for over 10 years I am appalled at the rising costs of travelling by train. Especially that rail travellers are charged to park their cars. The station car-parks now charge a significant amount of money to park there for a day. Where this car park can be used by shoppers, that there is a charge is OK. But if, like me, you have already spent a considerable sum buying a rail season ticket, to be charged additionally for parking is sickening. Given that most of the rail car parks are now privately run, there is also no control over what is charged, or indeed how often the charges are raised. At Huntingdon, it now costs \u00a34 per day to park, and other car parks are, I know, a lot worse. Given the freightening price of the rail ticket to London, this is terrible.\n\nThe aged and tired excuses of 'we have to charge to provide better ... whatever' just doesn't cut the mustard when no changes are visible year on year.",
