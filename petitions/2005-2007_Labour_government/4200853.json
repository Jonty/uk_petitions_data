            "background": "The rise in the vehicle tax for supposed 'Gas Guzzling' vehicles is unfair as many people require these vehicles to perform specific duties and/or proceed with daily life. These people work hard to buy these vehicles and in many cases are already being taxed on other issues more than everyone else, it's just another reason to penalise hard working civilians to fund the government for the majority of those who do not earn as much a salary. We now feel as if we live within a dictator state. The harder we work to benefit ourselves the more you punish us.",
