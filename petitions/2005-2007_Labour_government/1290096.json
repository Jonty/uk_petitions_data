            "background": "For 300 years the people of England have subsidised the Union including the recent welcome re-establishment of a Parliament in Scotland and elected Assemblies in Wales and N.Ireland. The English are being denied their democratic rights, whilst paying for those of our neighbours to be acknowledged and upheld. End it now, by holding referendums in all 4 component countries with 2 clear questions. 1, Do you want to end the Union and 2, Do you want independence? Sign up and make it happen!! The government is of the people, for the people, to uphold our will, not theirs!!",
