The Isle of Wight is almost symmetrical; simply by moving Ventnor to the other side, the Isle could become symmetrical down the vertical axis, providing huge benefits to its tourism industry at relatively low cost.\n\nPlease note that this does not affect the Isle's internal symmetry: the layout of roads and towns would not be affected, nor do we believe that the Isle should only be inhabited by identical twins.",
