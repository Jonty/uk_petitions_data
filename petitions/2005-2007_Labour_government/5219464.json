            "background": "The European Commission is considering relaxing the ban on including animal by-products in animal feed because of the costs to farmers (news story on BBC website under Science & Technology).\nThis practice almost certainly caused the spread of BSE among cattle in Britain, and the subsequent appearance of vCJD in the human population. The fact that it might only be allowed in poultry or pig feed is irrelevant. For years the government and scientists assured everyone that beef was safe because the disease could not possibly be transmitted from cattle to humans. Who would now be willing to believe their assurances that pigs and poultry cannot possibly transmit it to humans? In any case, once on farms some of it will inevitably end up being fed to cattle. We should have learned our lesson on this, and not risk having to go through it all again for the sake of short-term financial gains for some farmers.",
