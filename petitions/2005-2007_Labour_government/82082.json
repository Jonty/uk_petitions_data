            "background": "Housing tenants all over the UK are telling Councils that they want to stay with them and not become Housing Association tenants. The Labour Party Conference over the last 3 years has overwhemlingly said YES to the \"Fourth Option\" of direct investment in council housing and a level playing field for funding. What Tony Blair seems to forget is that the majority of tenants are Labour voters and with a General Election coming up shortly we are asking him to let Councils keep ALL of their housing revenue for the benefit of their tenants. NO REFORM OF COUNCIL HOUSE FUNDING. NO RE-ELECTION. I am asking tenants to sign this petition to let him know the strength of feeling in the country.",
