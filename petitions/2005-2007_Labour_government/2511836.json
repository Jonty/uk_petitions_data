Also that they can enter the building under cover too.\nI am due to move into a new block of flats in Huntingdon, and I am a wheelchair user.  The planners did not want to have any covered parking and had no idea what it would mean for us wheelchair users.  If it rained, we would get wet, sometimes, very wet!  This should not happen.",
