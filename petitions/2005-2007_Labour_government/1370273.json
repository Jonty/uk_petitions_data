            "background": "The Secretary of State has announced that schools can opt for Mandarin, Arabic, Urdu and Bengali as languages in the national curriculum instead of only major European languages such as French, German and Spanish. However, the list announced ignores India's major languages such as Punjabi, Hindi and Gujarati, which are already global languages through bhangra music and bollywood films. Furthermore, they are languages of India and the UK Indian diaspora and will be economically useful in the future as India becomes an economic superpower. We urge the Prime Minister to request his Cabinet's Secretary of State for Education to ensure these languages are added to any amended national curriculum on modern languages in schools.",
