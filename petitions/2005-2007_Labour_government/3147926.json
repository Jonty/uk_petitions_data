            "background": "If we are serious about tackling climate change we have to reduce traffic and encourage the use public transport.  Public transport will not be used if it is expensive, sporadic, slow or unsafe  It will also not be used if it is not normal practice. We must accept that we create the society we want.  One step towards creating a public transport culture and therefore reduce car journeys is to encourage children to use public transport.  Free public transport for children would be used and they would use it for life.  The short term cost will be high, but the long term benefits will be great and the cost would be repayed due to higher usage.",
