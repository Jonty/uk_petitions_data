            "action": "save the taxpayers of England the sum of \u00a352 billion by withdrawing HMG's offer to provide the long term funding package offered to Northern Ireland as part of the St Andrews Agreement of 1 November 2006.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "On 1 November 2006 the Chancellor set out a funding package for the Northern Ireland (NI) Executive worth \u00a350 billion as part of the St Andrews Agreement.   The Chancellor promised that the UK would commit to at least \u00a335 billion of funding for NI over the next four years and a further \u00a318 billion capital investment to 2017.  These official figures sum to the staggering figure of subsidy from England to NI of \u00a352 billion.\nThe petitioner asks why should the English taxpayer give these extraordinary amounts of England's wealth to the small NI population of only 1.7 million (i.e. some \u00a330,588 per person)?  England is the sole net tax contributor in the Union.  England does not believe that the intransigent politicians of NI should be rewarded with \u00a352 billion of England's money.  The UK Government's carelessness with England's tax revenues shows clearly why England must now have her own Parliament.",
