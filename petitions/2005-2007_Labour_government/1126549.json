            "background": "Five hens are packed into a cage measuring just 45cm by 50cm \u2013 only slightly bigger than your average microwave oven. The only time they leave it is when they are taken for slaughter. The average wing span of a hen is 76cm, the width of the cage is 50cm \u2013 so not one of the five birds can ever fully stretch their wings during their entire life. As if that wasn\u2019t bad enough, thousands of cages are stacked one on top of another \u2013 long rows of them several tiers deep in large, windowless sheds. Electric lighting glares for some 17 hours a day, all to artificially increase the day\u2019s length and promote egg laying. The birds stand uncomfortably and with difficulty on open, sloping wire mesh, through which their excreta falls. They have their beaks cut off and suffer disease in these cruel conditions.\nBasically it's hell on earth for them just so eggs are a few pence cheaper to buy.",
