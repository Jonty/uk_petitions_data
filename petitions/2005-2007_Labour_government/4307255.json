It certainly does not exclude ONLY male homosexuals, but (for example) prostitutes and drug-users too.   Please protect those who need a blood transfusion from HIV and other diseases that they may get if the rules are changed.   It is a matter of life and death to them.   It is NOT a matter of life and death to individuals to be permitted to donate.   The information on giving blood says that blood is tested for several things BUT that they are not always detectable in the early stages.",
