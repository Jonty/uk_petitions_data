        "background": "The Lancastria was one of the larger ships to be involved in the evacuation of British troops from St Nazaire in 1940 as part of the withdrawal from France.\nTragically the ship was sunk by the German airforce and thousands died. It is generally regarded as the worst sea disaster ever. Those survivors from the ship still living are campaigning for the site to be turned into a war grave to stop divers from looting the wreck.\nAs a mark of respect to all those who died or survived I urge you to sign this petition. Many thanks",
