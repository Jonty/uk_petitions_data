            "background": "Increasing the smoking age to 18 is ageist, if it's dangerous & illegal for 16 to 18 year old's to smoke, it's dangerous & should also be illegal for anyone to smoke. It's ageism to protect children & adult teen's from smoke & poison but not to protect the rest of us. The truth is, if any one age group is more vulnerable to smoke & poison it's the elderly, not teen adult's. We should forget about the revenue that the country will lose & ban tobacco outright, it's poison! & also we should make ageism totally illegal, not just in the area it makes extra revenue, banning ageism in the work place but allowing it to continue in every other place is not acceptable. Ban it outright!",
