            "background": "English for Speakers of Other Languages classes are a vital tool for social integration of people from ethnic minorities. They are a liberating force for people who would otherwise be isolated from the wider community. They make people more employable, better able to support their children's education and to be responsible citizens. Many students who currently attend ESOL classes are from households with very low incomes. They cannot afford to pay a commercially viable fee (about \u00a3500 a year) for the classes. Removing the entitlement to free ESOL classes will increase social division and could create a social underclass, leading to increased crime and potentially terrorist acts.",
