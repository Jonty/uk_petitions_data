This not only helps to keep them physically fit and flexible but it also gives each pupil the confidence and ability to stand up to any other pupils who might see fit to threaten them with physical violence if they don't comply with certain demands (typical tactic of the school bully).\n\nSo, by teaching ALL pupils how to physically (and mentally) DEFEND AGAINST the threats and/or actions of bullies we would empower potential victims and in the process take the power away from the bullies.\n\nPutting self-defence on the national curriculum would also be especially useful, indeed even critical, for girls later on in life when many of them typically come under certain types of pressure and coercion that boys generally do not.",
