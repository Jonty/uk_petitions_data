            "background": "Take a long term view of the fact tyhat whilst smearing the countryside with tarmac is initially far cheaper than laying rails, except in the shortest of termns, rail is not only far greener than road or air it is also far cheaper.\nTo roll steel on steel uses far less energy than to roll rubber on tarmac or to defy gravity. Also an electric tgrain or tram cvan use regenerative braking which actually produces energy  carbon.\n  In view of this reverse the iniquitous decisions to maintain road congestion and atmospheric pollution in Leeds, Liverpool and South Hampshire by reecting light rail schemes. And replace the scheme for a hybrid polluter between Nuneaton Coventry  Warwick University with a genuine light rail scheme",
