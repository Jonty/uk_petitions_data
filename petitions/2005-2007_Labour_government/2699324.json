            "background": "There isn\u2019t enough help for undergraduates after investigation I have found that if I was a postgraduate there are a large number of funding options to me, I feel that this isn\u2019t enough help and for someone to go into teacher it shouldn\u2019t be this hard, when this country has a shortage of people in an area of employment  I feel that funding should be made easier and the student loan shouldn\u2019t have to be the only option, why get into debt when teaching is in such great demand, a small sum of money should be made available each year to each student that is training to be a teacher as  incentive.\nWithin 10 year over half of all teachers are going to retire and the support needs to be set up now to make sure that the next generation of teacher are ready and that there are enough supply, I myself have considered dropping out of going to be a teacher, there is just simply not enough support.",
