        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "At present, every car in the U.K has to undertake a compulsory MOT test every year- if it is more than 3 years old. This is to ensure our cars are legally safe to drive on the road. It does not ensure that the driver themselves are still legally safe to drive on the road. With newer road laws, policies and an increase in safety awareness campaigns, we would like to see a law passed to ensure that all drivers holding a valid UK driving license sit a driving re-test every 5 years. This would increase the driver's road discipline, make individuals more safety conscious as well as enable them to adapt to new safer driving styles/techniques easier. This would reduce congestion, save lives and improve our environment.",
