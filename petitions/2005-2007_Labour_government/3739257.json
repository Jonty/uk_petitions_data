This is a waste of energy and resources in producing them, transport costs in moving items that are far more bulky than they need to be, causing more wagons than there need to be on the roads and costs more to recycle or takes up more room in a land fill site. This is unnecessary and the manufacturers should be made to only enough packaging that is essential, rather than making it look like you are buying more than you really are.",
