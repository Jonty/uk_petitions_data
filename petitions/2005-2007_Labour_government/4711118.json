This would also stop untax vehicles as the tax(VET) would be on the fuel and no-one could not get out paying the tax. Like the old vehicle tax which people could and cost the police and courts lot of money to recover the tax, so therefore saving money and time collect the new tax(VET), more money going into other transports systems as well money going back to other services that the country needs not in court fees",
