It's the greed of banks and multi-million pound companies that force people into near poverty, in the year 2007 nobody of full time employment should be losing sleep over  how many more weeks they have to wait to be paid again. Most of us would not be allowed to take 4/5 weeks holiday so why be forced to wait that long to be paid. it is time to stop the monthly pay",
