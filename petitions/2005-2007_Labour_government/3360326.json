            "background": "Automatic air fresheners such as those used in company washrooms should be properly regulated in the same way as cigarette smoke.\n\nMany such fresheners often emit a concentrated cloud of VOCs into a confined and poorly ventilated space.  At best the effects are irritating and at worst represent a very real health risk.  Some cans found in these devices even have helpful advice such as 'do not breath' and 'solvent abuse can kill instantly'.",
