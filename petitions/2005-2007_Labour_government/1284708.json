It should face up to the fact that we are a more secular country and they don't need as many Churches and as much land as they used to. By selling some of their land they could a) make more space for use for affordable housing, b) fund repairs to the properties they keep themselves rather than draining public funds, c) put money back into the community in projects to help the poor and under-priveleged.",
