            "background": "We all realise that congestion going into Manchester at rush hour or coming away at evening rush hour is getting worse. Therefore I and others welcome the plans for a congestion charge for Manchester City Centre. This is Zone 1 in the plans. However I find it unfair on the residents of Greater Manchester who live within the M60, they will be trapped either inside of outside of Zone 2 at the M60 at Morning or Evening rush hours. Therefore I call on the Government to abolish Zone 2 of the plans and make it a straight \u00a35 to enter Zone 1. This will also discourage people living in Zone 2 to go into Zone 1.",
