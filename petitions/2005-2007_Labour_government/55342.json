            "background": "Dear PM Sir,\n\nYou are surely very aware of the new visa rules relating to non-EU doctors. Unfortunately the medical personnel involved with appointing doctors are interpretting them wrongly, resulting in  discrimination against non-EU doctors. Part of the reason is the homeoffice not clarifying the status for HSMP visa holders. We are informed that we can compete for any job in the UK at par with local doctors. The medical personnel don't seem to think so. Because our visas are for 2 years maximum, they say it does'nt cover the full term of the job and try to rule us out of any interview opportunities, which results in us not getting any jobs! Most of us have contributed to the NHS atleast 4 to 5 years in our prime and this treatment at this juncture makes us feel very discriminated. Thanks you for reading this mail and I sincerely hope and pray that you can clarify these issues at the earliest.  Dr Kumar R Yathish<GMC Number 5203793>",
