            "background": "The road fuel duty escalation policy gave a clear incentive for people to change their lifestyles to reduce future use of a finite resource that contributes to global warming.  It should be reintroduced and the revenue used to improve UK competitiveness by reducing income and corporation taxes.\n\nFuel duty rates should increase annually by between 0% and 10%, with the target of ensuring that the retail cost of fossil road fuel increases at an annual rate of CPI+5%.",
