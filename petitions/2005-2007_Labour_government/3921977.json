            "background": "Over and over again, when government proposals on issues affecting ordinary people, are published the answer seems to lie in new or increased taxation. This approach inevitably leads to discontent, particularly amongst those who work and pay Income Tax. What is needed is a more imaginative approach or some lateral thinking. Current proposals to ease congestion are but one example, where a different approach to working lives would alleviate the majority of current and future congestion without the need to resort to new methods of taxation with all the privacy implications that road-pricing offers. Another example is interest rates always being adjusted in response to normal market fluctuations in spending. A more imaginative approach would lead to new idea generation with, perhaps, wider consensus and acceptance. Start with a blank sheet for revenue collection \u2013 what do we need and how should we pay for it \u2013 rather than tinkering at the edges year after year.",
