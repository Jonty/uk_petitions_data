            "background": "A multi-million pound obesity industry has been allowed to flourish, profiting from overweight people's misery when trying to lose weight. \n\nPeople of all backgrounds and incomes are involved in this epidemic and it should not be left to private companies and the pharmaceutical industry to deal with.  \n\nMany of those in full time employment cannot attend their GP surgery on a regular basis to monitor their weight and get impartial healthy eating advice.\n\nIndividuals classed as 'morbidly obese' by the BMI should have access to free weight monitoring clinics either in the evenings or at weekends, similar to those offered by the District Nurses during the daytime at GP surgeries up and down the country.  In fact, surgeries would be an ideal venue.\n\nInstead of paying a small fortune to companies selling faddy quick fix 'solutions', income would be better spent on healthier food, gym membership, leisure activities etc.\n\nThe service should be provided by healthcare professionals, encouraging more people to become dieticians etc.",
