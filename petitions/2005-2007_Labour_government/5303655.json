            "background": "Many mental health patients suffer flagrant breaches of their human rights by mental health professionals, most of whom appear to be completely oblivious of their rights - to Liberty, to respect for their private and family life, and not to be discriminated against. Only those who shout loudest from the highest rooftops seem to get their voices heard. We want to change this for the benefit of all concerned. Add your name and add your voice to speak for those who don't have a voice at present.",
