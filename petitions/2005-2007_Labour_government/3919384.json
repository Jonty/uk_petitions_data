As a result, many consultants are already boycotting the interview process while others despair that they are not allowed to consider candidates they would hire immediately if free to choose. Seldom has a policy managed to create such a number of losers without apparently a single winner. As hospitals contemplate being unable to treat patients in August and the best of our doctors queue to leave the country, it's time to act before it's too late.",
