            "background": "Section 172 of the Road Traffic Act requires a motorist issued\n     with a speed ticket to provide details of the driver. A fine is\n     payable for witholding the information. If the driver and owner\n     are the same, this is tantamount to demanding  a confession\n     under duress. Under British Law and European Law, the accused\n     is innocent until proven guilty and normally has the right to\n     remain silent, but not if accused of speeding. The Road Traffic\n     Act puts the accused in a worse legal position than if he had\n     committed a serious felony. I regard this as a serious breach\n     of human rights and would ask all citizens to sign this\n     petition. Make a stand for justice.",
