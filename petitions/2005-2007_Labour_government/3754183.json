            "background": "We petition the prime minister- and the entire nation \u2013 to cease to pursue the deadly and expensive path of being USA's world policeman's assistant. We seek to open a national debate on a massive change of course for the nation. Instead of our current death dealing path we encourage all with any influence to look to our successful, peaceful, nearer neighbours in Scandinavia for models of how to reduce egotistical macho warmongering pursuits and spend the money from taxation on better family life and health care. This means abandoning NATO, our membership of the nuclear madness club, and making large reductions in all armed forces; this will lead to a massive reduction in levels of fear and numbers of unnatural deaths, here and abroad.",
