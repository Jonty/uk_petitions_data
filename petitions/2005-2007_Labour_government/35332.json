            "background": "I have been refused a state pension. Reason given - I was divorced by British husband after 15 years of marriage - my sin apparantly was to eventually remarry a Canadian.\nMy claim for a pension against my British husband 's contributions is for the years in the UK when he went out work, I had his children and stayed at home and ran his off licence. The husband decided to emigrate to Canada in 1961 and I had no choice but to go as well because he threatened to take the children. The Pensions Dept has refused my claim for these years as I was divorced.",
