        "background": "Most agree that reform of the upper house is inevitable. Whatever might be gained in reforming the Lords, to change its name to something dreary, conventional and universal, like \u201csenate\u201d, is unnecessary and undesirable. Why change the name? Many institutions have changed in composition, purpose and methods over the centuries, without changing their names. Think of the monarchy itself and how much its role has changed.\n\nWhat's in a name? Do Beefeaters eat beef? Do the Household Cavalry go riding into battle brandishing their sabres? Would the Lords challenge the primacy of the Commons if the door weren't slammed in Black Rod's face? Of course not. Many traditions and ceremonies that are part of our modern idiom form an important link with our past, where they may have had very different meanings. Now harmless and charming, they nevertheless serve to remind us of our heritage and the continuity of life. To reject them is to sneer at the past.",
