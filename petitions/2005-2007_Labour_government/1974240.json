            "background": "The proposal by Ruth Kelly (in a Guardian interview of 9th February) suggests that '[local] councillors can have small budgets that they can draw on so if someone has a persistent problem in their local neighbourhood that could be sorted out very locally'. The suggested level of this budget is up to \u00a310,000 per councillor. It will be impossible to 'police' such expenditure to ensure that it would be undertaken responsibly, or to draw up guidelines that would cover all cases of local problems. In such circumstances these monies would in effect be a licence to undertake politically-motivated expenditure of tax-payers' money. All local government expenditure should be subject, as now, to budgets that can be publicly scrutinised, and local authorities should continue to be answerable for such expenditure.",
