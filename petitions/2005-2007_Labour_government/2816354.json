            "background": "children have a right to know the truth about their origins and should not be taught fiction as fact. No evoltionist has ever been able to prove evolutionary theory - there are no fossil records etc and it is unlikely to have happened.  the theory is also no good since is teaches that we come from animals (and therefore justifies behaving like them) and also that there is survial of the fittest (justifying selfishness) and it also implies inequality (some must be more evolved or superior to others) which is why it was used in the past to justify white men above blacks and so forth.  \nAlso all religious people should be allowed to teach that they were created by God and therefore not superior, or \"more evolved\" than others.  they should not be called unscientific for doing so (just go do your research and see how many great scientists - including Newton and Descartes were Chrisitan and how mnay Muslims have contributed to our understanding of the world).",
