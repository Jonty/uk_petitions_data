            "background": "Such a system would Vastly simplify our current system saving billions of pounds in public administration, enabling revenue collection only at point of Purchase, Store, Petrol Pump, restaurant etc etc eliminating the need to assess each and every person individually.\nThe current system is simply too complex, too cumbersome and far far too costly.\nThis is not a new idea. People in many coutries have suggested it, but to date no country has dared take this attractive and imaginative step, \n\nGreat Britain should be bold on this issue.\n\nIf people has more money (less Tax), they would undoubtably buy more.\n\nA taxation only on Purchases has a fundamental psychological advantage.\n \nRather than taking the tax before the public has had a chance to enjoy the Purchase, it allows the public to enjoy the purchase before it suffers the Tax.\n\nThe best way then for the Govt to raise taxes, might be for it to consider cutting them dramatically.",
