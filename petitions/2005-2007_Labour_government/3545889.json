Low-cost airlines are growing like mushrooms and one national airline company even have for example, 11 flight TO NEW YORK - Why????? 500 flights to Spain a day - just imagine how much pollution that is and how these airplanes help to speed up the global warming process.\n\nPlease, please, please support this petition - we cant reverse the effect of global warming but we could certainly stop it from increasing. Imagine the UK being underwater when the sea-level rises?????",
