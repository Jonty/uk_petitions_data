        "background": "Currently, the general period of copyright in the UK extends to 70 years after the death of the creator of a work. \n\nA creator can't benefit from copyright once he or she is dead. Current UK law is designed to benefit big corporations rather than creators.\n\nI propose reducing the period of copyright on all works to 50 years from their first publication. This will be simple and fair. It will benefit the public because once copyright expires on a work, it will probably be made available for free on the internet. Everyone will be free to make use of other people's ideas (tunes, artwork, literary characters etc.) once the copyright has expired on them.",
