        "background": "The cost of immigrating legally has doubled twice in the last two years.  Apparently this is so immigrants cover the entire cost of immigration and border control.  Illegal immigrants and immigrants from EU countries are not affected by the changes.  If you're looking to drive skilled labour out of the country I can't see a better way.  The government needs to start setting reasonable prices based solely on the cost of administering the applications.",
