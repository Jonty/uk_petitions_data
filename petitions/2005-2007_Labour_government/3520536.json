            "background": "We English speaking Welsh residents are guaranteed three English speaking analogue channels, those being BBC1, BBC2 and ITV1.  Even then, BBC2 attempts to bore the pants of us with local interest events such as Welsh rugby.  To make matters worse, many of us cannot even access Channel 5, although this may not be of the quality of the BBC and ITV channels.  I am not asking for S4C to be withdrawn, only for us to be given the choice of watching S4C or Channel 4.",
