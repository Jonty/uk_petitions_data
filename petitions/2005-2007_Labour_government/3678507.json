It has provided a \"natural health service\" for people. Yet it is starting to look a mess. \n\nChanges should be made to the subsidies given to farmers so that the countryside is better looked after. Developers and public bodies should be required to conserve the landscape and townscape better; towns need a structure of well-treed corridors and green spaces. A new campaign is required to stop litter, fly-tipping, untidy land, eyesores, and roadside clutter. The National Curriculum should pay greater attention to environmental education. \n\nMeasures like these could have wider benefits too, for example for biodiversity and climate change.",
