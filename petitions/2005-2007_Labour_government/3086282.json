            "background": "The Wheal Maid area is an ex-industrial mining area near Redruth, Cornwall that has been used for some 70 years as an off-road practice area.\nRecent activities by the council to close the area down by fencing the valley in which it sits, are being challenged by a wide range of groups including motorcyclists, who are holding a protest on 3rd March 2007. The area is an important practice area and currently no alternative appears to have been offered by the authorities. The Kernow Trail Riders Club, believe that a solution to retain the area for off-road activities would be in the best interests of all parties.",
