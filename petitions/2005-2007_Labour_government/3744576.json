        "background": "As the EU is more about political integration and control of its people now than the original basis of trade. this government should withdraw from the EU political group and establish a trade group more suited to our needs. The commonwealth of nations is a group of nations with a common heritage. The  commonwealth takes in a quarter of the globe and all governance is in english. A new commonwealth trading association could fulfil this need for international trade. The commonwealth takes in countries such as India, one of the fastest growing economies in the world. I would ask this government to consider the enormous benefit to emerging economies within the commonwealth and to the established ones such as britain, austalia, canada etc that such a new trading bloc would create. The EU is stagnating and driving us all down to a basic level, time we pulled out and went with people who we have  things in common and not be with these dinosaurs who dictate to us from brussels",
