        "background": "In light of the fact that this poor police office in Luton was killed by an illegal immigrant - and this could have therefore been avoided if he was kicked out of the country when his visa expired. Your government is therefore directly responsible for his death. You can NEVER change this, but some good can come from this tragedy. Remove ALL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS to their home countries now - even if it violated THEIR human rights",
