            "background": "Boxing Day is historically a day when large numbers of the public travel to visit relatives.  This year I wanted to do so by train - albeit less convenient than by car - to try to minimise my carbon footprint and reduce the amount of CO2 I create.  I have tried to book a train from  London to Salisbury, hardly a trip to/from the backwaters of the UK and was amazed to discover that there is no service on this day!  I have a 16 month old toddler and can not safely use coach travel unless I take my own child seat.  How can the Government's integrated transport policy ever work when this sort of service is allowed to occur?  The train operators are very quick to put the prices up for the peak time services but seem less willing to accept their responsibility to provide a total service, irresepective of overall demand.  Welcome back Dr Beeching!",
