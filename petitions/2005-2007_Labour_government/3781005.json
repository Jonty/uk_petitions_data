            "background": "The reduction of taxation and regulation of small, and medium enterprises would enable a more innovative and successful business environment. A business man who has to spend days on administration rather than producing new businees ideas is probably more likely to fail. Also the lowering of taxes would allow a smaller business to modernise and keep up with larger competitors.",
