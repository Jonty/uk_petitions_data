But these statistics alone do not give us a realistic view of the state of the NHS at the moment and in no way do these figures alone justify current NHS policy. What has the extra money been spent on? What has been the effect of this? Where have the new Nurses and Doctors recruited to? What has been the effect of this?\nNumbers alone mean nothing. The messages we get from Doctors and Nurses at the front line of the health service conflict with the implied improvements the figures present.\nWe need a more meaningful assesment of\nthe state of the NHS and we need it yesterday!",
