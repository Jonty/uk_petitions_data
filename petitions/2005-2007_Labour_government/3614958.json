They have been described by Uncut as 'cinema's most graceful and strangely beautiful clowns'.  \n\nStan Laurel was a British comedian/writer who took comedy to another level, in his genius we find the roots of all of the comedy we know and love today, his sublime talent has entertained generations of people all over the world, creativity at its peak.  The situations that unravel hilariously before your eyes leaves you in complete awe of the talent that wrote it....and in the vast majority of cases it was Stan Laurel.  The Knighthood given to Charlie Chaplin was deserved but there was another clown who changed the course of entertainment worldwide.....Stan Laurel.  It has been too long, now we have the chance to make amends.  Vote for Stan Laurel.",
