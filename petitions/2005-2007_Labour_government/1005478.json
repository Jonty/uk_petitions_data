        "background": "In the UK there are nine public holidays. ( New Year, St Patrick\u2019s Day, Good Friday, Easter Monday, May Day, Spring, August, Christmas, and Boxing Day.)  Seven (inc New Year's Day) of which are plainly rooted in religious traditions and practices. \n\nThat is 78%(aprox) Religious, primarily Christian/Pagan holidays.  In this secular and mixed faith nation. We propose that a new secular Public Holiday be created.\n\nTo this end we petition the Office of Prime Minister to establish February 12th as \u2018Darwin Day\u2019, a national public holiday, celebrating the Life and works of Charles Robert Darwin.  \n\n2009 sees the 200th anniversary of his birth (February 12th) and also the 150th anniversary of the publication of  \u201cOn The Origin of Species\u201d  so there would be no better time to make his birthday a national public holiday in recognition of this great man",
