            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "The idea is to raise roughly the same amount of tax as now but using a much lower rate which applies to many items which are currently exempted.ie lower rate, but wider base. So VAT would be 10% (not 17.5%) but would apply to all services and sales. Pension funds, charities, private houses and non domiciliaries would pay tax for the first time but only at 10%. Inheritance Tax would be 10% but on the whole estate amd with no exemptions for businesses or farms.There would be a social security tax of 5% on earned income.Stamp Duty would halve as would council tax.Pension lump sums would suffer 10%.Personal allowances would cease. Measures would ensure the very low paid were not disadvanteaged.The main purpose of the flat tax is not to cut expenditure but to relieve the ridiculouly high burden of personal income tax and social security tax suffered by middle class families with the economy receiving a substantial boost as a result.",
