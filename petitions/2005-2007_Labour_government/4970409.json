Since Ebay is the most popular bidding site online, we urge the prime minister to either enforce Ebay to stop concert ticket listings, or to enforce a cap on the price, such as no more than 30% profit of the amount they originally paid for the tickets. We also urge the Prime Minister to enforce Ebay to cancel listings for tickets that have been won in a free competition such as a lottery system.",
