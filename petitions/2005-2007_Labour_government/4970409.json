        "background": "Ticket scalpers/touters are using ebay as a way to make a profit and sometimes even an income, by selling concert tickets well over the face value they originally paid for them. Since Ebay is the most popular bidding site online, we urge the prime minister to either enforce Ebay to stop concert ticket listings, or to enforce a cap on the price, such as no more than 30% profit of the amount they originally paid for the tickets. We also urge the Prime Minister to enforce Ebay to cancel listings for tickets that have been won in a free competition such as a lottery system.",
