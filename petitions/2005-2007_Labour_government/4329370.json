        "background": "It did not have to be like this for Zimbabwe\u2026... When President Mugabe came to power in 1980, it was one of Africa's most promising economies - abundant in natural resources and with a well-developed financial system and prosperous agricultural sector. It was commonplace at the time for Zimbabwe to be described as the breadbasket of Africa.  Twenty-seven years later, Mugabe's regime has brought Zimbabwe to its knees. The country's inhabitants are poorer than they were in 1970. They live in a land where thousands are killed by disease and malnutrition every month and life expectancy is just 38 years. A place where only 15 per cent of those who can work have a job and where half the population scrape an existence on less than 50p a day.  Tony Blair wanted a legacy.  So why doesn\u2019t he do the best thing he\u2019s done since 1997 and deploy the resources needed to bring back the breadbasket of Africa.  After all Britain brought Mugabe to power so Britain should remove him from power!  Please make your point heard and sign this petition today.",
