            "background": "I think the way we insure our cars in needs changing. I believe that having to name drivers on policies is wrong and as long as a car is properly insured anyone should be able to drive it. Some of the Benefits:\n1. Cars, which are less powerful and cheaper to buy, will have lower premiums than more powerful and more expensive cars.\n2. If a son/daughter (who can drive) takes their parents car without permission and has an accident, they will still be insured to cover any damage to any other vehicle, person or property in that accident.\n3. It would eliminate the current sexist scheme where woman receive cheaper car insurance.\n4. In case of an emergency someone would be able to use a car that\u2019s not theirs (with permission), to take a person to hospital etc..\n5. It would assist ANPR (Automatic Number Plate Recognition) camera's, which currently can only check if a vehicle has insurance and not a specific driver, freeing up police time.",
