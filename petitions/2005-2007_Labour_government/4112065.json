            "background": "There is no sense in a law that allows abortion for socio-economic reasons but not simply for unwanted pregnancies. This acts as a prejudice against women who could perhaps provide for a child financially but could not provide for it emotionally. If a woman has chosen to ask for an abortion she clearly feels that having the child would not be in her best interests (and therefore most likely not in the interests of a future child). The granting of it should not be at the discretion of doctors. By all means medical professionals should have some consult with the person in question but the decision should be hers alone. That a doctor should be allowed to tell a woman who wants an abortion that she must keep the baby is dangerous for both the mental health of the woman and the emotional wellbeing of any resulting child.",
