            "background": "If you watch any television channel with adverts, you are sure to find a sexist advert towards men. Only a select few recent adverts have been sexist towards women, and I haven't seen one in over a year. They were obviously scrapped for being unacceptable. These adverts portray men as stupid, clumbersome, incapable beings; compared to the perfect and super-smart women. The past does not justify this. You wouldnt expect such a double-standard in race relations, so why should they occur in gender relations?",
