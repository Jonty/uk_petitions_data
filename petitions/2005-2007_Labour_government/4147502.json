            "background": "The Government are considering raising Road Tax on 4x4's across the country in the budget. This will obviously have a detrimental effect on most farmers and the rural community who use their 4x4's correctly. i.e Towing vehicle, off road, small holding, etc. as opposed to the Chelsea Tractor drivers. A proof of use should be submitted so that the Tax can be fairly collected. There is also the problem of selling/trading in a 4x4, how does the Government intend to deal with this problem. Please add your name to this petition.",
