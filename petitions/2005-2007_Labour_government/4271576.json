            "background": "Over time Tesco has acquired a site in St Albans that forms part of its land-bank of undeveloped land - on the former Eversheds print works (OS grid reference 152068), bordered by the north-east side of London Road (A1081).\n\nSt Albans already has a large Sainsbury\u2019s, Morrisons, Waitrose, an Iceland, a Tesco Metro, a Tesco Express, and a Marks and Spencer food hall.  There is also a Sainsbury\u2019s hypermarket, incorporating a larger Marks and Spencer food hall, 3\u00bd miles away in London Colney.  There is local feeling that another supermarket is not necessary.\n\nSt Albans has been set tough Government targets to build more housing - some local residents believe that the Tesco site is more suited for hundreds of high density starter homes.  A city centre supermarket would make the already bad traffic congestion much worse.\n\nTesco's planning application was delayed because of delays over acquiring part of the London Road frontage. An application from Tesco is expected to be submitted.",
