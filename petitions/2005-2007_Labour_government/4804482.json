            "background": "We believe that the current regulations that allow HGV\u2019s to use the outside lane of 2-lane motorways creates rolling roadblocks, causing congestion, frustration and potentially dangerous queue undertaking. Current \u201cJourney Time Trials\u201d by the Department Of Transport on the M42 and A14 preventing this action already appear to prove the effectiveness of such a ban. As HGV\u2019s are (in theory) limited to the same top speed of 56mph, there is no real reason for them to use the outside lane for overtaking manoeuvres.\n\nSuch a ban should apply to all vehicles above 7.5 Tonne gross weight, on all 2-lane motorways and rural dual-carriageways (where grade separation exists).",
