            "background": "Breed bans should be removed and replaced with a license system, working similar to gun licenses in the UK.\n\nAny and all dogs have the potential to be dangerous, not just the lock-jaw, and fighting dogs that have ownership restrictions and are currently banned from breeding in the UK.\n\nIn fact, these \"dangerous\" breeds are no more deadly then a mouse provided they are handled and trained correctly. Therefore the danger lies in the owner, and not the breed.\n\nA dog ownership/breeding license for these said breeds would be a lot more beneficial for not only the safety of the public, but also the breeds themselves.\n\nWe shouldn't punish a breed/dog for the mistakes, intentional or otherwise, of the owner.",
