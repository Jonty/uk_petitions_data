            "background": "We believe that a Dog Licencing system should be re-introduced, to stem irresponsible ownership of dogs. \nThe licence should also be co-ordinated with compulsory microchipping, so that a National database can be put in place for stray dogs. Dog Wardens should be paid for from the dog licencing system, and they should be given more powers to report (and fine) people not clearing up dog faeces from public parks and areas.\nEnforced dog licencing will also curb the sad state of affairs we see nowadays - where hundreds of thousands of dogs are destroyed each year because people no longer want the responsibility of caring for them.  \nIt will ensure people THINK before owning a dog.",
