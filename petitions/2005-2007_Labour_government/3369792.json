        "background": "Some British rock climbers, many of them members of the British Mountaineering Council, have, against the wishes of other climbers, deliberately damaged by drilling (and placing expansion bolts) natural (unquarried) cliffs and crags from Lands End to the Highlands of Scotlands in the last twenty years. This proliferation of bolts as even taken place at sites of Special Scientific Interest. It is probable, that the vast majority of some 4 million hillgoers do not want this deliberate  damage to the environment to continue.",
