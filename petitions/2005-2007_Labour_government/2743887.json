        "background": "Currently in the United Kingdom the poorest 20% of the population pay more as a proportion of their income in tax than the richest 20%. Not only is this blatantly unfair it reduces the incentive for people to seek employment and lessens social mobility within the country. As a first step the Government should introduce a 50% income tax rate for all earnings over \u00a3100,000. I believe this would be a good start and hopefully lead to fairer and equitable taxation system.",
