        "background": "We all use the streets as do our children that we push in pushchairs; toddlers, who are at eye height to billboards displaying the latest horror movie, with blood dripping from eyes, nostrils and more than likely, no eyes at all. Would you sit your toddler down in front of the TV and allow him to watch a horror movie? Seeing is believing and what we see on the streets will influence how we behave at home, in the classroom, at work, how we sleep, the degree of intolerances we accumulate and so on. Clean up of the streets is vital to the wellbeing of the community, Without the removal of horror movie billboards, we will be allowing the horror, that by law a minor is not permitted to sit and watch, into the lives of our children influencing them to accept that horror is the norm leaving them in later life, unable to discern between right and wrong, ultimately costing the community in, as an example, vandalism and overall lack of care for the next generation to suffer another time around.",
