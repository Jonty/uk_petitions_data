EG should the train services be cancelled and as a result the worker has to a. hire a car or b. stay in a hotel as they would be unable otherwise to get to work that cost should be met by the union.  Also should the business be forced to close its doors early to accomodate reduced public transport they should also compensated for loss of projected turnover.",
