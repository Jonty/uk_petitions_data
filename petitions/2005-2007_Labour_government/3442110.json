            "background": "It is an unfair charge on the catchment area of SW Water to pay for something that the EU & government insists must be done. Why should a relatively small number of people pay such high water rates that benefits every visitor who comes on holiday to the West Country. This charge should be shared by all water companies & subsidised by the government to help lower the highest water charges in the country for the lowest paid people. SW Water rates customers should also be refunded the huge amount they have paid so far.",
