            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "It is evident that the UK road transport system urgently needs an overhaul. We acknowledge the government's main purpose in introducing a road taxing scheme is to reduce congestion.  We believe that this initiative makes sense and is a step in the right direction. However, more serious than congestion is greenhouse gas pollution which might not hold us up when travelling to work, but threatens the survival of humanity.\nThus, we the undersigned not only demand from the government a road taxing scheme which addresses congestion, but one that simultaneously addresses pollution. This can be achieved by making the road tax dependent on the level of pollution emitted by a vehicle as well as on the congestion at the time of travel. \nIf this taxing scheme is revenue neutral it is a fair deal. Therefore, the road tax revenue should exclusively be used to finance improvements to public transport and roads as well as to support the transition to a pollution free transport system.",
