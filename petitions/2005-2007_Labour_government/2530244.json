        "background": "...currently Steve is forced to wake up every morning and commute to an office in order to make enough money to survive in his apartment in County Hall with Jacoozi, Sauna, Pool and Gym on-site.  This is an afront to his human right to do what he wants, when we wants, with whomever he wants.  Therefore, to redress this, we, the undersigned, petition the Prime Minister to provide an index-linked \u00a3100,000 annual stipend to Mr Willmott that will allow him to exercise his Human Right to unlimited leisure along with a \u00a3500,000 one-off payment to compensate for the 13 years work abuse he has already endured.",
