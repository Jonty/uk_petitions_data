            "background": "Sex offenders to be given a choice of castration and early release from prison or extended sentences and tagging after release; This instead of forcefully castrating sex offenders. Even with counselling many men cannot control their over-active sex-drive, sterilisation enables men to live a normal live without the urge to abuse. This is an excellent alternative to Sarah\u2019s law as it helps men to avoid sex crimes and helps the community from the threat of abusers. If offenders are given the choice between early release and castration or extended prison sentence and tagging after release their democratic rights are protected whilst at the same time the community is protected too. Medication does not always have the desired effect and may effect the health of offenders adversely.",
