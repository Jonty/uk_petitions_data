        "background": "As a well behaved person I have all too often noticed badly behaved teenagers rewarded for their bad behaviour.\nFor instance, in school, I have all too often noticed that when the time came to count up the merit points at the end of the year, I had six. Some of the so-called \"badasses\" of the school- you know the type, disrupt the class stop everyone else from getting their work done- have around 100! They get special trips for \"team building\" while the rest of us are stuck in school.\nI feel it is time to abolish this, before the good kids turn bad to receive the same oppertunities and the bad kids get worse to get more.\nStop encouraging bad behaviour and maybe there will be less youths hanging around on street corners terrorising their neighbourhoods.",
