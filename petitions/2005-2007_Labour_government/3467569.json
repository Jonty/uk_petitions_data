It is incredibly frustrating for me, as a student who takes all three sciences at A level and gets nothing, to watch a student who takes Mickey Mouse subjects such as media studies, which have absolutely no challenge to them, receive up to \u00a330 a week! If you want science students in the UK; respect them!",
