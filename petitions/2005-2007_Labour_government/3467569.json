Students should be paid on the basis of the difficulty of their eduction in order to reward them for their efforts, and not on their parents income. It is incredibly frustrating for me, as a student who takes all three sciences at A level and gets nothing, to watch a student who takes Mickey Mouse subjects such as media studies, which have absolutely no challenge to them, receive up to \u00a330 a week! If you want science students in the UK; respect them!",
