            "background": "Sport England clearly has what it considers its priority sports often pushing other sports to the back of the list.\nWhy should sports such as Football and cricket be in the top section of Sport England?\nIt is wrong all sports have a value to those taking part and no one sport should be put above another. Angling has more people fishing the football as playing football yet football is in a higher position WHY. We the tax payers want a level playing field which gives equality to all sports large and small.",
