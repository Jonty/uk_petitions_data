            "background": "Almost all tax payers have areas of government spending that they entirely disagree with, regardless of any political party affiliation.  This petition would see an option provided to each individual, e.g. though tax self-assessment, to declare the items they do not agree to fund.  This would not result in paying less tax, simply a re-distribution of payments away from unsupported spending areas.  It is accepted that this would have to be a paper/statistical exercise at least initially; however there is no better way to test public support of spending policies.  I myself would not support faith schools and the Iraq war for just two.  If enough people use the facility, it could become a particularly valuable sounding board for both public opinion AND for spending planning.  Do not dismiss this one entirely as unworkable - it is challenging and against the norm, but nothing else.  Take pride in where your tax pound is spent!",
