            "background": "As recently reported, the DTI has withdrawn \u00a368m earmarked for the scientific research councils. This money was \"ring-fenced\", and the DTI have withdrawn it to fund costs arising from the collapse of the Rover group and for \"unexpected increase in support needed to cover British Energy's nuclear liabilities.\"\n\nNot only is this a major blow to research funding in the UK, it marks an unhealthy precedent, whereby government departments can claw back money they've already promised to one group in order to fund their other failures.\n\nNot only do we petition the PM to return the money, we also would ask for an undertaking that this not happen again.\n\nThis issue has been covered by both the BBC and the Guardian.",
