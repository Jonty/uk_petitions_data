        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Whilst possibly solving some of the issues around inequality in access to good quality education, the use of lotteries for allocating secondary school places would have profound negative effects in a number of areas some of which would ultimately negate the benefits sought.\n\nThe government should work to ensure an excellent standard of education for all and not spread out the places in badly performing schools between unwilling and helpless victims.\n\nAs a result of placement by lottery, children would on average be likely to need to travel further to school. Not environmentally friendly and not conducive to having more time for study.\n\nChildren would be more vulnerable by attending schools away from the area in which they were brought up - without the support of the local community in which they attended primary school.",
