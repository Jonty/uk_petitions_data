            "background": "It is evident that your government is trying to push through the Trident replacement programme without anything like a democratic process. This issue is far too important for the British public and Parliament to allow this to happen. \n\nYou owe it to us and to our children and grandchildren to let us have a say in our future nuclear policy. In any true democracy, it is not the place of Government to dictate terms to its citizens on such a fundamental issue as the future security of the nation, especially when the proposed programme is expected to cost the UK taxpayer in the region of 30 billion pounds.",
