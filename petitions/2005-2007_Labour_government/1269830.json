        "background": "the adjudicating system for the land registry is unfair it should have a place where you can challenge the decision before it becomes final..this would save a lot of time and money .. not everyone can afford to go to appeal ... the adjudicator can make mistakes and you have to put up with them ..this should not happen ... if you want to appeal it is the same adjudicator who will give you permission and if they make mistakes your chances of going to appeal are very slim ..this should not happen .. the adjudicator can rule on hearsay and this is not fair and it should not be allowed .... there should be more than one person making the decision",
