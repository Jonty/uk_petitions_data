            "background": "There is evidence that the public sometimes find it difficult to get help to bring the person who used their credit card fraudulently to justice. Banks, Retailers and the Police need to be clear about who is responsible for allocating the resources towards seeking justice. Decisions about whether or not to investigate a case of fraud should not be made on the basis of whether it is just cheaper to write off the fraud than investigate it. Just writing off fraud is sending out the wrong message. It is unfair to victims of fraud. Further it is not in the wider general interest of society because there can often be links between card fraud and other serious crimes and terrorism.",
