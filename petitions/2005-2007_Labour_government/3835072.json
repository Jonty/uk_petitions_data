            "background": "There is an argument that nuclear power stations are the answer to our continued use of electricity in the future.\n The facts don't support this. It would take many years before these power stations come on line.  Huge costs would be involved both financially and in CO2 levels in their construction.  They would be obvious targets for terrorists.  We should build many more wind farms as Britain is the best situated country in Europe for wind power.  We should also be investing in decentralised energy systems.",
