            "background": "The General Teaching Council is calling for the end of SATS.  Part of the government's defence is that parents like them.  In fact, parents see that:\na) The heavy workload in the year leading up to the tests (particularly at 11 and 14) puts pressure on children at school and at home. \nb) Frequent formal and practice  tests cause stress, demoralisation, boredom and alienation from school.\nc) Teaching focuses on what is needed to do well in the tests and children are not being given a broad education.\n\nThe Observer of Sunday  10 June 2007 quotes General Teaching Council chief executive Keith Bartley: \"We are saying to the government we do not think your policies are best serving the young people in this country or their achievement...The range of knowledge and skills they assess is very narrow and to prepare young people for the world, they need a set of skills that are far broader.\" \nThe GTC is calling for a \"fundamental and urgent review of the testing regime\".\n\nPlease sign this petition to show that the wider public wants children to have  a childhood free from undue stress and an education that prepares them for life not for the test.",
