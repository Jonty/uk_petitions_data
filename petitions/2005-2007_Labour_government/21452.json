        "action": "Reform the House of Lords to a fully elected chamber with equivalent powers to The House of Commons, except in the area of the Budget",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The House of Lords should be fully elected, with franchise based on the counties and major cities. Each county and major city should have 2 members elected for a fixed period at different times in the electoral cycle - akin the the system used by the US Senate. Any differences between the two houses would be resolved by a joint conference. Finance bills would be excluded from the remit of the Lords to enable prompt budgeting. All other legislation would need the consent of both Houses.\n\nAdvantages:\n\n1) Lessen the blizzard of legislation out of Parliament\n\n2) Only legislation with broad support would be enacted.\n\n3) The less populated areas of the UK would get better representation.\n\n4) This system would reduce the power of the executive and raise the standing and power of Parliament, by preventing super majorities in the Commons railroading legislation thru Parliament.\n\n5) Better checks and balances on government",
