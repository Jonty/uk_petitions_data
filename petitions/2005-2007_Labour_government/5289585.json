            "background": "The future of Everton Football Club is being jeopardised by a vocal minority who hold the view that the club's prospective move to a site in Kirkby is tantamount to \"surrendering the city of Liverpool\" to the RS.  The distance from the current ground to the proposed site is around 4 miles; it is possible to move the ground a greater distance within the Liverpool boundary.  Accordingly the objections being based upon a line drawn for public administrative convenience seems to be a particularly contrived.  To ensure that the concerns of this minority are addressed and to safeguard the future of our club we propose that the site for the new ground be declared part of Liverpool.",
