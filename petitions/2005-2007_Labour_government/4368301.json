For example, if a Councillor has been caught claiming illegal benefits, it is hypercritical if they are condemning members of the public who are doing the same. The parties should have to delare each year and prior to any elections if any party members and not just elected officials have been convicted of a crime and the seriousness of the crime. Politicians are good are telling the public how to behave but the public should have the right to konw if they are doing the same.",
