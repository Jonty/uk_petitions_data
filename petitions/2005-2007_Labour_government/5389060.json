            "background": "Judge Julian Hall sentenced allowed Darren Wright to walk free from a court room after being convicted of sexually assaulting a 10-year-old girl.  He also imposed a sentence which will mean Keith Fenn walks free in four months after raping the same girl.  In his remarks he said that his lenient sentences were due to his consideration that the girl had \"dressed provocatively\" (which is not a defence for rape) and that she \"looked 16\" (as though it would be ok to rape a 16-year-old).  If the government genuinely means to tackle the appallingly low conviction rate for rape cases, this official needs to be removed from the system.",
