            "background": "Frank Field is (according to the weekend press - 16/17 June 2007) about to publish a report which includes some statements on the level of benefits which are paid under the current rules. An example was a single parent, 2 kids under 11, parent working 16 hours at the minumum wage.\n\nI am not saying make them live on \u00a380 a week or thereabouts.\n\nI am challenging the total benefits paid - which bring the total income up to around \u00a3450 a week.\n\nIf one is in fulltime employment and paying Income Tax (approx 22%) and National Insurance (approx 10%) one must earn in excess of \u00a330,000 per year to have a net income of the order of \u00a3450 per week.\n\nIt seems quite wrong that one can be paid over the national average salary in benefits.\n\nThis petition asks that benefits be limited to the salary one earned whilst in employment; to limit the support to a maximum of 5 years; and by so doing to end the cycle of benefits dependency.\n\nA further benefit is that the tax burden could ease thus making the UK more competitive / creating jobs / etc",
