            "background": "I propose that the current method of raising road excise duty is scrapped, the monies should be collected from fuel duty, this will require a small increase in fuel costs, the benifits will be to burden the heaviest users with a greater bill, whilst the low end users will have a much smaller bill, this will also see foreign travellers to our country helping to finance any road schemes and at the same time place a larger burden on those using gas guzzlers and those that tow caravans and the like. low distance drivers will then only pay for the time they are on the road rather than the same as those that are on the road all day every day.\nThe tax disc could be converted into a two disc system indicating valid insurance and mot, making the dodgers more obvious to the enforcers.",
