            "background": "Business Rates have become a massive burden on British business.  Right-wing organisations frequently campaign to lower Corporation Tax, yet they forget about Business Rates altogether.  Corporation Tax only affects businesses making a profit but Business Rates don't even give businesses a chance to make a profit in the first place.  Business Rates should be phased out over a period of time consistent with the Chancellor's aims of competitiveness and macroeconomic stability.  Let's give our small firms a chance to compete in the increasingly global world.",
