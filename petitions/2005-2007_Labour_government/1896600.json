            "background": "We the undersigned feel that the sale of vile quiche in bakeries of our fine country is eroding the moral fibre of our country and contributing to socioeconomic problems such as drug abuse, vandalism and petty theft.\n\nThis filthy foreign foodstuff can now be found where previously healthy and nutritious pies were sold.  As everyone knows a pie is a balanced meal enclosed in a golden pastry crust.  Many scientific studies highlight the benefits of eating pies which are too numerous to list in full here but include higher IQs, better sporting performances and higher levels of caring and understanding in the fast-paced multicultural Britain of today.",
