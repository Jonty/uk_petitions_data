        "background": "In the 1990's all tenants in social housing were able to apply for a tenants incentive scheme to provide a deposit of up to \u00a314,000 (dependent on term of tenancy) to assist them to get onto the property ladder, and leave rented social housing for those in need. Please bring it back and help us get out of rented accomodation and force our landlords to pay us something back.\nFor example I have rented since age 17, I am now 37 and approximate the rent I have paid to be \u00a372,000. If I had the ability to put down a deposit I could have paid for my own home by now.",
