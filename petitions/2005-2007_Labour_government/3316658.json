            "background": "I feel that ALL decorative festive lighting (i.e fairy lantern style lights, rope lights, large inflatables ect ect) should be completely removed from buildings (both private and public) by the 1 February after the previous christmas. \nI feel that the lights are using un-necessary energy and by cutting the amount of \"antisocial\" bulbs used, we can help save the planet. \nI also feel that having christmas decorations still errected, is extreme bad luck.\nPlease support me on this as it is a subject close to my heart.",
