        "background": "Students should pay less on the daily fares using oyster cards on the tube and the bus - it is unfair that student discount is only offered on weekly and longer passes. For example, a journey within zone 1 using oyster costs \u00a31.50. For students this should be, say, only \u00a31. The scheme should extend over all zones.",
