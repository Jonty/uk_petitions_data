        "background": "The Government's strategy for tackling pollution is simple - if it moves, tax it; if it doesn't, tax it anyway! Yet we do not see their benefits.\n\nWe need both economic and morale incentives to take a more acceptable alternative path, and that path must exist. Taxes currently are no real economic incentive e.g. road tax of \u00a3400 on a \u00a360k gas guzzler. We feel no morale obligation - links between emissions and the environment are tenuous; taxes pointless and indiscriminate. No reasonable alternatives \u2013 inefficient/expensive public transport; few energy alternatives.\n\nThe Government must develop an over-arching strategy for tackling emissions - evidencing the harmful emissions, the main drivers for these, with analysed options of how these can be reduced/offset. In order to ensure clear and effective accountability, this strategy should be drafted into a Bill, and put before both Houses of Parliament.\n\nFor once, Government should use some common sense. Messing about and justifying each tax increase as \u201cenvironmental\u201d is feeble, only fills Government coffers and is detestable in the public\u2019s eyes.",
