            "background": "The current system of inheritance tax currently affects only 6% of estates. It brings in \u00a33.6bn in revenue that helps to provide vital public services. \n\nIf the government plans tax cuts, we believe that there are far better ways of cutting tax that will benefit a far greater majority of the population. \n\nWe urge the government to resist pressure from the press and keep it's current inheritance tax regime, making only occasional inflation based adjustments.",
