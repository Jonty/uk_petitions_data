            "background": "The majority of vehicle pollution and vehicle deaths are caused by the majority of vehicle drivers.  While current fashions dictate that scapegoats are being blamed, the majority of vehicle-based issues would be greatly reduced by pushing employers towards allowing employees to work from home.  A large number of people who work behind a desk, e.g. call centre workers, could work from home rather than commute every day.\n\nPlease put in place stronger incentives to persuade employers to make working from home the default rather than the exception.",
