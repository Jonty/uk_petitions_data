            "background": "Charles Bronson (prisoner number BT1314), currently residing in the CSC Unit at HMP Wakefield, has spent twenty eight years of the past thirty four years in solitary confinement in various prisons around England. This is an extremely inhumane situation and certainly not one that can be supported by any government which subscribes to the European Human Rights Act. \n\nCharles Bronson has never killed anyone, raped anyone or assaulted any woman or child. He has expressed genuine remorse for his previous actions both inside and outside prison and has made sincere and demonstrable efforts to rehabilitate himself over the past six years. He is a very compassionate man and has been responsible for raising many thousands of pounds for children\u2019s charities in this country by creating pieces of art to be auctioned for good causes. His continued isolation is unwarranted and an affront to any person in a civilised society. \n\nWe, the undersigned, believe that it is time to take positive action to improve Mr. Bronson\u2019s situation by immediately removing his category A status and removing him from permanent isolation with a view to releasing him from prison.",
