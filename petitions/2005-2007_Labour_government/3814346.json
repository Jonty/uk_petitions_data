        "background": "Laxative abuse is a growing problem, especially among young people. The companies that produce these products are today seeing record profits. Laxatives are easily available, in ever increasing quantities and strengths. Is the whole country constantly constipated or is this trend pointing towards a more disturbing picture of the rise in related eating disorders? I feel the availability and colourful promotion with no health warnings of these products need urgent review. This could lead to a greater understanding of these eating disorders and the resulting long term health problems associated with this abuse.",
