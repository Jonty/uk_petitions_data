            "background": "I own a 4 by 4 and use it for towing a caravan and i have a large family. I dont feel that penalising people who need 4 by 4's by increasing tax is right. People like farmers and large familys and caravan owners buy them out of necessity rather than us being rich and now we are being punnished for it. Maybe raising the tax for people who dont need them is the answer.  Also why should cars of a certain age be tax exempt as they probably create more pollution than new 4by4 vehicles.",
