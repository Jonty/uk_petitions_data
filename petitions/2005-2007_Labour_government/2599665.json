            "background": "Introduce a combined tax, insurance and mot certificate that must be displayed in the vehicle, in order to try and prevent people driving without insurance, tax or mot on their vehicles. The certificate should also state whether the insurance covers named drivers or any driver, and if named, the names of the drivers should be listed. A photographic card should also be issued, stating the drivers entitlement, ie a single vehicle, or any vehicle, that is linked to the licence to ensure drivers cannot drive any vehicles that they are not insured or entitled to do so. Any extra costs to the driver in implementing this scheme should be offset by the reduced insurance premiums that would arise as a result.\nIf anyone continues without insurance, then wages or benefit needs to be reduced to cover the costs in the event of a claim by any other party, rather than raising the insurance of the other party.",
