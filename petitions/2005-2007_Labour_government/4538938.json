        "background": "Child trust funds are an unnececessary burdon on the hard-pressed British Taxpayer. It is a responsibility of parents to make financial provision for their child(ren), not governments. I signed the current petition against Inheritence Tax. If Child Trust Funds were scrapped there would be one less State handout and one less excuse to impose Inheritence Tax on families who are forced to sell their family home, or part with their parents' investments which would have also ensured their own financial independence from anything more than the State Pension, (which they themselves have paid for), in retirement.",
