            "background": "Agricultural subsidies are one of the largest barriers to trade remaining in the world. Most importantly they cripple the economies of the poorest nations by making their primary exports uncompetitive in the richest markets. Furthermore this issue has been stalling the Doha round of WTO negotiations for years, holding back our own economy by holding back the negotiations  on a new agreement on trade in services and well as further reductions of tariffs for manufactured goods. Obviously the complete removal of funding for farmers is not a political reality, however by shifting the funding away from the subsidising the production of food. Funding could be applied for management of the land to create woodland habitats that would also serve as carbon sinks. This could by used to create carbon emission rights which could be traded to ease the financial burden of subsidies on the EU.",
