        "background": "Research shows that between 5-8% of the population suffer from fibromyalgia and chronic myofascial pain, yet most sufferers are not diagnosed until they have suffered for at least 2 years. \n\nWe need awareness to be increased so that patients will be diagnosed earlier on and be able to start treatment sooner. \n\nPatients should not have to wait for more than 2 years for a diagnosis of a condition that is so common! \n\nMost medical degrees include only 1 or 2 lectures about fibromyalgia and myofascial pain, despite the fact that more than 1 in 20 people suffer from these painful conditions! Doctors need to learn more about fibromyalgia.",
