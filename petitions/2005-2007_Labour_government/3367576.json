            "background": "In an effort to slow down or halt the escalation of the cost of living, essential commodities such as heating, lighting and water, should be publicly owned. As it is possible to profit from these utilities under private ownership, then it must also be possible, under good and proper management, to profit from them in public hands. Such profits would be wholly used for maintenance and expansion. The quangos set up to oversee the efficiency of the utilities would be replaced by elected bodies, with the power to veto price rises. Presently, their role seems to be that of a 'rubber stamp' to the budgetary requests from the industries to which they are linked.",
