I suggest this of course because the headquaters could be based in the UK (which would make it the only EU thing in the UK) and with minor local ones in the other 26 EU nations. We could use this to our advantage for promoting the english language by having most of the programming in english (with subtitles for the non-english speaking EU nations).",
