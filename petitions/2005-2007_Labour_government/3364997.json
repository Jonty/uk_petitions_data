            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "Huge numbers of RAF personel from RAF Lossiemouth have been posted to RAF Marham, which is a base virtually no-one wants to go to due to lack of facilities for them and their families.Most of these people are happy at RAF Lossiemouth and are therefore more productive in their current jobs. These people are settled in the local community and because of this are having to leave their families behind. This creates great personal strain, a lack of morale, and will result in a much reduced workrate.Engineers who are happy to remain on front line squadrons and project the expeditionary warfare required of todays modern airforce should be left alone to do so. More power should be made available to Squadron commanders enableing them to retain whatever personell they require to achive the tasks presented to them. \" Front-line first\" is a quote from a few years back, however, at the moment it seems that the front-line requirements are secondary to that of second-line and depth maintenance. Can you pass it on to the powers that be?",
