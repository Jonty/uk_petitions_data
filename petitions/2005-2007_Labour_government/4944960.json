            "background": "As recycling facilities offered by most local councils are steadily improving, one aspect of waste which remains largely ignored are juice cartons; anything of the tetrapak variety cannot be recycled by the councils as they do not have the facilities to deal with the combination of cardboard and aluminium. however, there is one recycling for such materials in the UK. This petition is to promote the recycling of such materials either by re-introducing free postage to the plant that offers the recycling service and for government campaigning to raise awareness of this priblem and it's possible solutions.",
