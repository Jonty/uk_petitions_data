            "background": "Raising interest rates removes money from the pockets of a few less well off, and transfers much of it to a very few very rich.\nIn so doing it has little effect on inflation, and has an adverse effect on exports, industries ability to invest, jobs and those who are working hard to support a family.\nBy increasing tax instead the government would take more money out of the economy in total, while having less impact on hardworking people. This would reduce inflation without hurting industry.",
