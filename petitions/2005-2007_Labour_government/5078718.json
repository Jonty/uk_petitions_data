        "background": "Stop illegal immigrants - Send them back to France\n\nWe can solve the immigration problem in the same way that the Japanese do. That is to send immigrants back to the country they arrive from. That is usually France. The Japanese government have apparently totally solved their problem of illegal immigration by this method.\n\nThis may be the preferred method as our government  is reluctant to send them back to the country of their birth, apparently as they say they may be ill-treated in their home country. Also, on arrival in UK they often throw their passports away, to avoid repatriation.\n\nIf the illegal immigrants were sent back to France they could not claim that their lives would be in danger.\n\nThis method of repatriation to the country of embarkation is allowed under the EEC treaty.\n\nOur nation is full we can not take any more.",
