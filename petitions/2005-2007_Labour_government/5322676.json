            "background": "On Fathers day 17th June 2007 a base station mast was erected in Hexham Northumberland 60 metres from over 40 residential homes 20 businesses and 90 metres from a nursery and middle school.\n\nThis shows the insensitivity of these mobile operators.  This mast was UNAMINOUSLY rejected by the local council after 2 years of deliberations and site visits etc, NOT one councillor voted in favour of it, but because of the bully boy tactics of the mobile operator they called an inquest from Prescotts office and an inspector came to a hearing. He bent to the will of the operator and overruled the decision which was carefully made by the local councillors.\n\nThis makes an absolute mockery of the local planning process and why should one man who is in the employ of the very government that has taken billions of pounds off these mobile companies be able to overrule the descision of the very people who care about and live in the area around the mast. \n\nWe no longer live in a democracy.\n\nThe planning laws need changing now.",
