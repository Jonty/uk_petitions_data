It represents a huge threat to the economies of Africa. \n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation, Malaria has been estimated to cost Africa more than $12 billion every year in lost GDP, though it could be controlled for a fraction of that sum. \n\nIs malaria preventable?\nYes it is. \n\nHas it ever been eradicated in other countries? \nYes it has in the United States and in Europe many decades ago. \n\nCan we do the same in Africa? \nYes we can if we have the will and the motivation.\n\nPrime Minister, please use your influence worldwide to speed up the eradication of malaria",
