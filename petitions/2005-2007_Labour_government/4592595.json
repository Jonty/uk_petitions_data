            "background": "Research has shown that what we eat can cause many diseases.  In particular diabetes, heart problems, cancer, arthritis and bone weakness are linked to diets that are low in vegetable and fruit intake. High animal protein and fat are also responsible.\nThe superiority of vegetarian diets has been proved.  Traditional Chinese diet, low in fat and animal protein excluding milk is even healthier than the Mediterranean diet.\nImmingrants from such countries to the USA start suffering from the typical western diseases within twenty years.\nIn the 1950's it was discovered that US soldiers, killed in the Korean war, had silted up arteries, despite the regular physical exercise they took.\nA wholefood plant based diet is the recommended food intake.  Schools menus should follow this guidance. Our children's health is paramount and prejudice and traditionalism should not get in the way of their future health and happiness.",
