From huge mega-stores to small convenience stores and garages, the disease that is Tesco is spreading throughout our country.  I'm all for a bit of healthy competition but fear it is getting out of hand.  What will it be next I wonder, Tesco hospitals? Tesco schools? \nSurely the billions Tesco already make is sufficent to keep them in business and keep the staff they already have in full employment.  Just don't let them get any bigger.",
