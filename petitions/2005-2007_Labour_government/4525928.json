            "background": "Children are not the same as adults. They have differing levels of development and dependency and they process and react to problems in a different way. They need expert, age appropriate assessment, treatment and supervision. \n\nBeing treated under compulsion has lifetime consequences. These children and young people are vulnerable, many become homeless, self-medicate with alcohol and illegal drugs, find it hard to get work and can become chronic revolving door patients because they fear engagement with statutory services. It is essential that they receive appropriate care at the earliest possible stage to prevent this happening.\n\nMental health commissioners and providers should be placed under a statutory duty of care to meet the needs of children and young people subject to the Act. Many proposals on the rights of children admitted under compulsion were endorsed by the Joint Scrutiny Committee on the 2004 draft Mental Health Bill but have been omitted in the current Bill.",
