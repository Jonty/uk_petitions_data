            "background": "On April 6th 2005, the government introduced new childcare voucher legislation. This allowed both parents, (if employed and paying PAYE), to save Income Tax and National Insurance on registered or approved childcare. In the 2006-7 tax year the allowance is \u00a355 per week, or \u00a3243.00 per month. \n\nThis means a significant saving per parent for the 2006-7 tax year of up to \u00a3962.28 per year for a 22% tax payer and \u00a31195.56 per year for a 40% tax payer.\n\nThis is a benefit designed to make childcare a more affordable, less prohibitive, cost for parents.\n\nHOWEVER THE GOVERNMENT RUN NICS DO NOT SUPPORT THE GOVERNMENT BACKED SCHEME. \n\nJoined up Government?",
