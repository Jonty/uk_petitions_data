            "background": "The Welsh no longer have to pay for prescriptions on the NHS, whilst England, Scotland and Northern Ireland residents have seen an increase in prescription charges. It is an inequitable situation that needs to be addressed, by either reinstating charges for patients in Wales or providing free prescriptions for all patients in the rest of the union. Currently people who suffer from lifelong illnesses are forced to pay for medicine that allows them to function in society (asthma etc) there needs to be one rule for all as England, Scotland and Northern Ireland are now subsidising free prescriptions for the Welsh. Equality for all in the Union.",
