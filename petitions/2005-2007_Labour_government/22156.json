        "action": "Reduce VAT to 5% on Energy Saving Recommended windows in line with other energy saving products",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Energy Saving Recommended (ESR) windows (rated A-C by the British Fenestration Ratings Council) are proven to significantly reduce carbon emissions from the home. If every home in the UK installed C rated windows, or higher, carbon emissions could be reduced by 12.8 million tonnes a year, and every year after. This is the equivalent to removing 840,000 cars from the UK's roads every year. For the Government to achieve its 2010 target of reducing carbon emissions by 20% homeowners need to be encouraged to install energy saving products, such as ESR windows. However, while the Government has reduced VAT to 5% on some energy saving products, like solar panels, insulation and draught stripping to encourage homeowners to install them, windows have been excluded from the scheme. We are lobbying the Government for VAT to be reduced to 5% on ESR windows.",
