The future plan if for this data to be shared with all govenment agencies and be kept in a national data warehouse.\n\nthis would link your tax record, NHS record, DVLA record etc etc etc.  giving us a totally orwellian state circa 1984!\n\nNHS care could be refused based on your criminal record for example.  The hipocratic oath that medical staff operate under would become null and void.\n\nWe cannot trust this or any future govenment to store such sensitive data on computer or worse still use it for more sinister purposes.  Please please help us stop this.",
