            "background": "It is well known that nude swimming and relaxation is both healthy and natural.  Yet in the UK there are very few places where this is permitted without fear of prosecution.  The laws on clothing optional activities in the UK should be brought into line with those in the more enlightened European Countries.  That is more Beaches, secluded areas in parks and even designated times in public swimming pools.  This petition does not ask for a total acceptance of public nudity but merely when appropriate as say in Denmark or Germany.",
