        "background": "Stop scoring cheap political points on road safety.\n\nRoad use is an easy target for politicians who want to demonstrate their safety credentials. Hence the raft of pointless road safety initiatives and policies such as speed cameras, speed enforcement, drink drive campaigns, road humps, mobile phone use, seat boosters for small people etc, etc. Please stop it.  We have to acknowledge that road use cannot be made 100% safe, the money we spend on new initiatives has diminishing returns. Politicians need to invest their efforts and spending in areas which will have better safety returns. Stop making criminals out of motorists. The biggest distraction I have when driving is not my mobile phone it is the passengers I am carrying, is the logical conclusion to all this nonsense is that we should ban them too?",
