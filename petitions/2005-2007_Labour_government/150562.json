            "background": "As ludocris as it might sound to those of us brought up in recent times, there used to be a country called Palestine in the middle East. That country generously agreed to sell land to displaced Jews after WW2, and so the state of Isreal was created. Now, Palestine does not exist as a country, but as two small parcels of land; The West Bank and The Gaza Strip. Naturally this made many of the displaced Palestinians very angry as they now have no home to call their own, and foriegn armed forces launch assaults on poverty stricken areas to stamp out 'terrorists'. When innocents are killed in this way, exteamism is born. The only way to cut down on the amount of suicide bombings, is to curb the Isreali agression against innocents and to give these people their country back.",
