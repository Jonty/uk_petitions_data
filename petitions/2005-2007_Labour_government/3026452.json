The ID card will not stop this as they always find a way around it.  The police are so tied up with paperwork that they only go for the easy targets.  I would love someone to prove to me that the drug dealers etc are going to get an ID card and suddenly become law abiding.  No, it will the general law abiding people of this country will yet again be hit.  This scheme stinks of EU ruling and our government is selling us out again.  Where will it end - a chip at birth with just a YES button.",
