            "background": "Cycle paths are designed to increase safety on the roads for cyclists.  It can help to decrease the number of cars on the  road and promotes a healthier living.  Cyclists are often criticised for their behaviour, which is only correct, but this is often hard to change because so many cycle paths have cars parked on them, as if it is an extra parking lane.  This especially happens near schools (defying the object of increasing health, fitness and safety of children) and cash machines.  Cars are also parking on pavements, therefore restricting the safe movement of pedestrians, especially those with pushchairs or wheelchairs.  Car drivers must learn the responsibility of their actions in order for us all to transport ourselves safely and more freely.",
