            "background": "Asthma, allergies and food intolerances in children can be prevented by early exposure to bacteria and mild infections. Children are now brought up in extremely sterile environments and although rightly prioritised in GP surgeries, the vast majority of appointments are due to weak constitutions in the young and are therefore avoidable. If these unnecessary appointments were made available to others, the waiting lists and overall strain would be significantly reduced. \nMud eating will increase exposure to low levels of germs and bacteria, bolstering the immune system and prevent unnecessary strain on health services.\nRecommended daily dose of 'mud' will be a child's handful, which can also be substituted for a handful of leaves, insects and worms, or river water to cater for vegetarians, vegans and all other dietary requirements.\nThankyou for your support.",
