            "background": "How many times do we hear that the government is losing millions of pounds because of people not having their vehicles taxed? put the tax on fuel and kill two birds with one stone . . . .  Those with large engine vehicles or do thousands of miles a year will pay for what fuel they use and those who do not buy road tax will be paying anyway because they have to buy fuel to drive their cars. This philosophy has been proposed before but nothing has been done, lets get things moving and reduce the lost money by taxing those that use large engine vehicles, do lots of miles and more importantly those hell bent on not buying road tax, think about it Mr Prime Minister you could reduce other taxes as you will not be losing out on the millions lost to TAX DODGERS!!!",
