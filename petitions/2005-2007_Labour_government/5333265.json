            "background": "I'm propose that the government setup a Online Syllabus learning \\ Reference website.  I don't see this as a replacement for Teachers and Schools rather more like a additional learning resources.  \n\nExamples of what the site should contain :-\n\n1) Multi-media content on every part of the syllabus from the very best teachers.\n\n2) Reference guilds - Not every learns the same way so different example to learn the same thing.\n\n3) Help Forums - Allow children to get help from the site. \n\n4) Homework Diary and Guides - Allow teachers to place item on here giving assessment dates and also links to further help.\n\n5) Maybe submission of homework via this method.\n\nThis a broad idea and the content is more than likely change.",
