            "background": "Regular users of the First Great Western London to Hereford services have tolerated a dramatic deterioration of service with an inordinate number of delays and cancellations on this line. We believe we should expect a service to adhere to its published schedule and that a reliable train service is not a privilege but an entitlement we pay for. The situation is serious enough to warrant action from the minister for transport regarding the negligent management of the train services by FGW.  Bad service has had an impact on our professional lives. Thousands of train users no can no longer depend on the service to get them to work and instead take to the roads. In spite of numerous attempts to get FGW to take action on the abysmal service, no substantial action has been taken by the company. FGW need a policy of refunding 50% the cost of tickets purchased for a particular service that is more than 30 minutes late and full refund when the service is more than 60 minutes late or canceled.",
