            "background": "The scheme to re-develop Boundary Park is essential if Oldham Athletic is not to return to financially struggling team (or worse). Whilst recognising the need for proper consultation and Oldham Athletic to address resident's genuine concerns, a degree of NIMBY-ism is creeping into the responses.  \nIt should also be noted that the Oldham Roughyeds Rugby League Club would be tenants in the development, and both clubs to be successful. Their work with the community is vital, but more is needed.\nIt should also be noted that councillors and staff need to be completely transparent with their decision making process, and declare whether they are for, against or neutral to the development.",
