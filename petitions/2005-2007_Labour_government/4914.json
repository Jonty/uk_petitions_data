It's really good that there is now a better way to petition people - better for all sorts of reasons.\nBut this website is hosted by No. 10 - by the government.\nUnder the paper based system, anyone could raise a petition and hand it in, but now the government censors what petitioning can be done.\nThis petition is to reclaim the peoples right to petition, free of government control.\nThe controllers of this website may claim that they are benign administrators, but if so, why would there be a problem to break the link with government and move petitioning to  the oversight of a genuinely independent body.\nSign this petition now, and reclaim another of our ancient liberties that this government is slowly withdrawing from the people.",
