            "background": "The current Welfare Reform Bill will not help people it will further disadvantage them. It will target the people who are least able to defend themselves.We need Welfare Reform that is about helping people not sanctioning people.How will reducing there benefits help them? It will mean that they will have to go cold and hungry as they will be unable to pay for power to heat their homes or food to feed their families.The idea of rewarding private companies for getting people off of benefits rather then doing what is best for the claimant will mean that people will be thrown of benefits which will then be paid to line the pockets of the rich.This Bill is not about helping people but about an arbitrary target set by a government that has little or no understanding of the problems of disabled people or single parents. We ask that the Prime Minister stop and think again and ask the people who are most effected how things can be made better and how their life\u2019s chances can be improved.",
