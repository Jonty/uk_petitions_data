            "background": "This country is supposed to be a democracy, but more and more people are feeling that they are unable to express their views democratically.  Ken Livingstone has been given exceptional freedom to make sweeping changes to our London life-styles.  He wastes money on apparently asking public opinion and then tells us that 'he knows best' and implements his ideas regardless of overwhelming public hostility.  We are frustrated and alarmed that the public vote no longer counts and is being over-ruled by Ken Livingstone, whose powers now seem to be unquestionable.",
