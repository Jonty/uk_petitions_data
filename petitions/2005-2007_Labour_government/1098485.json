            "background": "Bears are cruelly killed for their hides. They are either shot during hunts or ensnared - sometimes for days - in traps before hunters finally come along and shoot them.\n\nFor nearly two centuries, the MoD has waged a war on black bears while doing almost nothing to replace the use of bearskin with synthetic materials. In fact, when PETA Europe presented the MoD with high-tech synthetic materials - which were sourced from leading faux-fur manufacturers and made to the MoD's own specifications - the MoD was quick to reinforce its support of the use of real bears for its hats. The MoD made pathetic excuses about why it wouldn't use the faux fur, claiming that it \"lacks life\" and \"doesn't bounce back\". There is no excuse to kill bears for hats.",
