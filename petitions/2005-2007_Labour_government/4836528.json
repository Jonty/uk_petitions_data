            "background": "In recent years there have been a large number of speed ramps / cushions installed around the country, predominently in social housing areas.  These ramps, despite their strict dimensions, cause damage to vehicles.  Suspension repairs have increased considerably despite drivers reducing speed to almost a standstill.  Cars are not designed to regularly have to navigate these obstructions in the road.  If speed restrictions are necessary then the government should implement something that will not cause damage to cars.",
