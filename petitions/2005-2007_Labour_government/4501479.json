            "background": "Many people in the UK have recognised a need for young people to have a role model. \n\nWe, the undersigned, believe Will Ferrell to represent all that is good about life in general. His attitude to life and acting exemplify productivity, hard work and people skills.\n\nAnchorman has gained international recognition for portraying equal opportunities in the workplace. We believe that if more people in Britain used the values and attitudes Ferrell displayed in his role as Ron Burgandy, the UK would be a better place.\n\nAlthough he has not yet loaned the labour party any cash, we are sure some of his earnings from 'Blades of Glory' could be diverted to a suitable account.",
