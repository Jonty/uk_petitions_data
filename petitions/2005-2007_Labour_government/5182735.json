            "background": "Council Houses distort the market and keep rents artificially low (Contrary to popular opinion private landlords don't make much money fron rental income). The government should pay Housing Benefit were appropriate not build houses let on rents subsidised by the taxpayer. After all the most fundamental reqirements of life are food and water, but the local council doesn't sell fruit & veg they leave that to Tesco. Don't get me wrong I'm not against housing people but if the rents reflected the true cost of runing a property then the market would supply all the housing needed and would actually improve the shortage.",
