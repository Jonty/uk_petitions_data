            "background": "The majority of students within 6th education studying the Welsh Baccalaureate believe that the qualification has been poorly designed offering no extensions to skills already learnt through the GCSE system. As pupils we feel patronised by this 'dumming down' of education. We have been constantly told that the qualification aids our entry into the work place and further education, however, this has only occured in a handful of cases. If this qualification is not scrapped, can the assembly at least review the position of it, and its content. The subject detracts study time for more specialised subjects and the majority has been covered in most GCSE subjects. It is obsurd that it is worth the same as a 'A' in the advanced levels. As a citizen and representative of a large body of students opposing this subject i ask you to review the qualifications position and its content. Thank you.",
