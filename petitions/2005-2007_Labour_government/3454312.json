        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The Banks have been caught with their hand in the till once again. The latest money generating scheme to come to light is the extortionate amounts charged for the execution of wills.\n\nOne Bank charged \u00a318,000 to execute a will that contained six simple bequests to individuals, with the balance of the estate going to charity.\n\nA solicitor would charge between \u00a3750 and \u00a36,750 for the execution of a similar estate valued at \u00a3450,000, which is bad enough when you consider the comparative simplicity of the  will in question.\n\nBut at least the average solicitor is not as greedy as the average High Street Bank.\n\nAny other individual who was caught taking such excessive advantage of the grieving and the deceased would be labelled as a crook and a cheat. He or she would have to face the full might of the Law.\n\nSo please add your name to this petition, and show your support for a practice that should at least be investigated by the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n\nThank You.",
