            "background": "In October 2006, the Office of National Statistics announced that it is planning to insert new questions in the forthcoming 2011 census. These include for the first time questions about people's level and sources of income and the ownership and purpose of second homes. These could be used to determine, for example, how many nights couples who are not permanently living together spend with each other at any second home they occupy. Such questions constitute a significant intrusion into people's personal lives and should not be asked as part of the census.",
