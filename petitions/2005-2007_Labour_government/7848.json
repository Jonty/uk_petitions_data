            "background": "Too many people are living on tax payers money, when they are more than capable of working, but just don't want to.\n\nWe need to introduce a scheme where people who are not working are evaluated and if they have no medical reasons for not working then they should be made to take any job offered, and only get vouchers for food, gas, electric etc.\n\nIt seems that nowdays there are two ways to get paid.\n\n1). Going out to work everyday and brining in a wage\n\n2). Staying at home every day going out every night. Living off tax payers money\n\nAll this wasted tax money could be spent on the NHS, transport system, education, etc\n\nObviously people who can't work for medical reasons should still be entitled to what they have now.",
