            "background": "At a time when the UK is seemingly no longer a 'christian' state, why does the RE syllabus inform teachers that they have to focus on christianity? Yes, RE does have a place in schools, to breed tolerance and respect for other cultures, but we feel it should be done in an unbiased way. Children should have some input on all religions, especially those native to these isles, such as Paganism - namely druidry. We urge you to reconsider the way RE is taught in schools.",
