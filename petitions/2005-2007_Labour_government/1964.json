        "action": "Introduce a system of energy efficiency measuring for computer equipment",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Currently locally assembled equipment can not be easily certified as 'energy star' or under energy efficient brand marks. \nIn fact, only individual components can easily be energy efficient certified under the various schemes, and these brands and stamps are not visable to the end user.\n\nThis has resulted in the sale of computers such as Dell Intel Pentium 4 systems that use in excess of 250W of electricity to function. Despite the technology and components being available for the assembly of a similarly powerful machine consuming 50W or less.\n\nSolution:\nIntroduce a self testing system available to computer shops and assemblers around the country, allowing them to certify on an A-G scale the power consumption of computer equipment.",
