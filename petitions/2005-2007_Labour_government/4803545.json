        "background": "The government give money to students to fund their maintenance whilst at university.  When the student graduates and gets a job they have to pay this loan back.  Therefore you would think that the government would give the same loan to all students as it is that student that has to pay back the loan.\n\nBut no.  Instead student loans for maintenance are means tested on parental income.  However I feel this is wrong because the loan has to be paid back in full anyway.. Therefore I feel that all students should be given the same amount of maintenance loan.",
