        "background": "The current Olympics logo as unveiled on the 4th of June is a day-glo abomination and an embarrassment to this nation. From every conceivable design viewpoint the logo is irredeemably bad and should be scrapped forthwith, if the designer can be driven through the streets of London chased by hounds even better.\n\nWe're not adverse to fresh, new innovative designs but the proposed logo is none of these it is just a travesty. London has an abundance of talented graphic designers, we suggest you employ one of them.",
