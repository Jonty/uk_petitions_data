            "background": "To stop the courts and prisons ending up full,take the offenders and this means burglars, drunks (minor offenders) etc to one side birch them and release them back into society. At least they will be seen to be punished and I feel would end up giving up their life of crime/unrulyness rather than get the birch each time.This would be an easy fix on a Friday night at closing time. No Police paperwork easy to apply, this country has gone soft on repeat offenders. Why do you think they repeat offend? It is because there is no punishment involved.",
