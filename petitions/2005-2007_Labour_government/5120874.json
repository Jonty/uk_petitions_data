            "background": "We recognise that Bank Holidays are useful to Society in that they are days on which local and national festivities may take place, knowing that many persons are not working and may therefore participate in the many communal events that are arranged in towns and cities up and down the country\n\nNevertheless, the current situation whereby three such holidays occur within a short period of time (seven weeks in the case of 2007, with only three weeks between the May Day and Spring Holidays) is a nonsense, bearing in mind that a period of three summer months will now pass before August Bank Holiday on the last Monday of that month.\n\nThat one way this might be accomplished is by abolishing the Easter Monday Holiday (which can fall in mid-March and often unsuitable for outdoor events) It cannot be seen that this could affect religious sensibilities. Further the Spring Bank Holiday (which used to be tied to Whitsuntide, but is no longer) could be abolished and moved to the end of June and a further day be fixed either in the autumn, say mid October, and/or on a fixed date in late winter/early Spring (but giving aufficient gap betwen then and May Day)",
