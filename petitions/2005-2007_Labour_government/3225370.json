We should be creating an incentive for hard work and recognise those who try to go to university or college to create a life for themselves, not rewarding teenage girls for getting pregnant by giving them money in the form of benefits and two-bedroom houses which everyone else picks up the bill for. The government are giving out the wrong message by saying 'get pregnant,throw your life away and we will provide for you whilst you do nothing'. Those who work hard stand little chance of getting onto the housing ladder, whereas those who are lazy and idol get houses and funds handed to them at the expense of those who want to succeed!",
