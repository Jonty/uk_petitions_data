            "background": "At the moment we\u2019re only catching bogus gas fitters after somebody has died.\nThousands of boilers are fitted every year throughout the UK by bogus gas fitters.\nWe all know there are lives at risk when dealing with gas boilers, yet the government seems so relaxed about the sale of gas appliances/parts.  Any Joe Bloggs can walk in to B&Q, buy a boiler and some speedfit pipe/fittings and have a go.  This is absolutely ridiculous.  STOP retail outlets selling these items, and ensure that trade counters restrict purchases to CORGI card holders only, with fines in place, just like with cigarettes & alcohol (which are obviously far less dangerous).  With what intentions would an average person purchase a boiler from B&Q apart from fitting it themselves?\nLet\u2019s put this right once and for all.  It\u2019s the only right, sensible & fair thing to do for the general public and genuine gas engineers.  The ONLY people who will disagree are cowboys, and the retail outlets.",
