Of course I accept the right of any shop to make such a decision but if I knew this was going to happen I could stock up on the shoes (or whatever) before they stopped selling them; this would, presumably, also benefit the shop in that they would (obviously) sell more.  I'm sure I can't be the only person to experience this frequent  frustration.",
