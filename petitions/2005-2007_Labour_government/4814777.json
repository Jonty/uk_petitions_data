            "background": "The government is due to consult with a variety of agencies with regards the possible introduction of a single unitary council for County Durham.  The government is not going to consult with the public, the most important stakeholders.  Instead they will consult with largely unelected bodies. Where is the democracy in that!!  It would seem that the speed at which they are wanting this to proceed indicates a certain amount of insecurity and a total disregard for the democratic principals it claims to have sent our troops to fight for in Iraq and Afganistan",
