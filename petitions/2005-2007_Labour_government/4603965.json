        "background": "In recent years the care offered to pregnant women has been reduced to the point of putting mums to be and their unborn children at risk from late diagnoses of pregnancy related conditions.  Anti natal visits have been reduced in total to six with midwife and two at hospital, these include booking, routine bloods and routine scan.  In the last trimester visits have been reduced by half meaning any potentialy harmful problems could go undetected for up to four weeks.  Cuts in the number of midwives must be reversed to give all women the level of care this government promised to all NHS users when they were courting our votes",
