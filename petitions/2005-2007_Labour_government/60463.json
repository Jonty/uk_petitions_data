Would it not be possible to give the option of overseas service, working with depeartely underpriviledged children etc, to young offenders. This would relieve the prison service and, perhaps, give them some sense of how lucky they are. It would not be staright forward, discipline would need to be maintained, but would surely be worth it if it changed some attitudes.",
