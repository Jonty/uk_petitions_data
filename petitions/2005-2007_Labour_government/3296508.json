        "background": "There seems to be a growing trend for some TV stations to increase the amount of advertisement interruptions to programmes, as well as their duration.  While one can recognise their need to pay for the programmes through advertising, we feel that the TV companies are losing sight of the purpose that people are actually watching the programmes for.\n\nIt would also be helpful if companies would stop their interruptions with  coming programme information during the titles at the ends of programmes.\n\nIt would also be better if companies, including the BBC, would curtail their identity slots where the extol their virtues and just get on with the programmes.\n\nAll of these represent a diminution of the quality of viewing presented by TV companies and serve no good purpose.  Some advertising, including of coming programmes may also put customers off products, the coming programme or even the channel itself.",
