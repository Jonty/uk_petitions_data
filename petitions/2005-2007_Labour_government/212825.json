        "action": "Build nuclear power plant to close the pending energy gap",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "North sea gas supplies have 'peaked', existing nuclear and coal fired power stations are reaching the end of their lives. Renewables cannot make up the gap, and we shall become increasingly dependent on imports from politically precarious countries. We must become self-sufficient in energy as soon as possible. Renewables are too erratic and taking all related costs into account, much too costly compared to nuclear - ergo we must build nuclear plant. This means encouraging investors and discouraging opponents; cutting through planning inhibitions. Without nuclear, energy prices will soar and/or the lights will go out. National security depends on secure energy supplies.",
