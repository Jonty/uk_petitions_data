We fully accept that we should be responsible for our OWN actions and accept any penalty that should be lawfully imposed for a crime or offence that WE may commit. But, the idea of penalizing anybody to support the victims of other offences committed by others, however inhuman, surely goes aginst the principle of being innocent of any crime until proven guilty of the offence that they have been CHARGED with, not someone else\u2019s offence, or an offence that may be committed in the future!",
