            "background": "The 4x4 is the scourge of the 21st century urban environment. Uneconomic, gas-guzzling and downright dangerous, they prowl the streets outside our cities' primary schools, seeking whom they may knock down and seriously injure. \nThe average 4x4 appears to be driven by harrassed parents with a back seat full of screaming kids in areas with many children engaged in the risky activity of crossing roads. They are accidents waiting to happen.\nWe would be better off with them removed from our streets.\nPlease sign up and beseech our government to rid us of this modern pest. Or at least make them pay heavily for their continued existence.",
