I don't think one can endorse in any way that, whatever your views about capital punishment.''\n\nHe added: \"Frankly, to get the kind of recorded messages coming out is totally unacceptable and I think whoever is involved and responsible for it should be ashamed of themselves.''\n\n----------------------------------------\n\nFrom this it seems as if Prescott condones the death penalty as long as its carried out behind closed doors. We the undersigned believe the Prime-minister should condemn the execution as deplorable -REGARDLESS- of it being carried out in front of, or behind the camera.",
