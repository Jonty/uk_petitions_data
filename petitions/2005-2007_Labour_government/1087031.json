These circumstances have arisen during the UK and US occupation for which we have obligations under international law; however it is arguable that these Iraqi citizens have, intentionally or not, worked toward the national security interests of the UK and through the lack of security for which are at least partly responsible, their lives are at risk.\n\nIt is in our interests as a country that defends its allies and has a well defined humanitarian conscience, that we consider all applications for asylum from Iraqi employees of the Coalition that might seek asylum in the U.K.",
