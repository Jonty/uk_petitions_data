            "background": "Dear Mr. Blair, we urge you, as the leader of our nation to intervene and petition the FA to reduce these outrageous prices for the FA cup final 2007. The game of football and certainly this showpiece final is being priced away from those who support it most - the fans. Those people who support their team each week, come rain or shine. How can the FA justify charging \u00a380 or \u00a395 to watch a game of football? A family will pay nearly \u00a3300 to go and see their team - the price of a holiday!\nSo I ask you sir, step in, ask the FA reconsider their pricing structure for the final, do so on behalf of the fans.\nThankyou.",
