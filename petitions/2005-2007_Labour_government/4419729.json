            "background": "I am so fed up. I have read so many examples about PGCE trainees having difficulties passing the numeracy skills tests, even Maths PGCE students, who studied to ALevel. Teachers working in schools on unqualified rates of pay for five years may lose their jobs if they don't pass it this year. I passed a 3 hour maths test set my Manchester Metropolitan University 9 months previous to taking the numeracy test which I passed and nearly five years later i am on my 7th attempt.The government has wasted 6000 pounds training me and I can't get a job in a mainstream school as an art teacher because of the test. Its format is wrong!",
