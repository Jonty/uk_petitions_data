            "background": "to rescind and withdraw the uk's membership of the european union by doing this we would regain control of our borders and therefore have a more robust control over immigration and asylum seekers entering the uk illegally via mainland europe.   We would be free to trade with the rest of the world as well as still trading with europe, this would not affect our economy.   Parliament would regain full control of all legal and taxation issues.   the savings made to the british taxpayer could be spent more efficiently such as in the NHS and education etc.   I would therefore request a national refferendum as soon as would be practical. God save the Queen.",
