Then use a 3 strikes and you're out rule for anti-social behaviour linked to individuals drinking. At all P.O.S. you will have to show your license is current to buy and if found drinking by authorities show your license - would suggest it looks like a driving license picture type. Nearly all adult anti-social behaviour is linked to alcohol abuse, would wager that it has more impact on society than driving does, which we need to hold a license to do. It would also act as proof of age.",
