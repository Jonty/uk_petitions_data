Other key routes in the scheme are the A514 (Osmaston Road, Chellaston Road, Swarkestone Road), A516 (Uttoxeter New Road), A6 (Duffield Road, London Road), A61 (Sir Frank Whittle Way) and the A52 and A38 dual carriageways.\n\nChris Wynn, cabinet member for planning and transportation, said the council was still considering whether or not to go ahead with the plan",
