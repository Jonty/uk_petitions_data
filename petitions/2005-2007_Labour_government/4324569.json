            "background": "For years now the FA has been run abysmally.  They have had scandals (Palios and the secreatary), appointing Steve McClaren because they rushed to get a manager installed before the World cup when there was no need and left us in this petition.  They have also presided over the fiasco that is the new Wembly stadium. Not forgetting the report they commissioned which said that they were not good enough and needed to change and was ignored. If these people had been on a professional companies board or even in the government then they would have been replaced by now, however there is no apology or any sort of responsibility associated with the FA. Since this is an English institution that is being made the laughing stock of the footballing world we feel the government should make attempts to allow regular fans to have a say in their FA.  For the good of UK sport and youth development there needs to be a change at the FA and it needs to be now",
