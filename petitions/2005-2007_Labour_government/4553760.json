Leaving smelly refuse out to fester in higher temperaturs during summer is deplorable. it encourages vermin, which we know are on the increase. it encourages new strains of 'bugs', which seem incurable without great expense in costly medications.we can all stay healthier, and be less of a drain on N.Health costs if we can keep our environment clean and disease free. We just need councils to clear away our rubbish, and this problem is half solved.",
