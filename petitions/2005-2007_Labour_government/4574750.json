In my opinion majority of the people not voting is because they dont believe that anyone is worthy of having their vote. It will be good idea to always have a column called \"No One\" in all the ballot papers, so atleast we can see the true turnover and will give idea of how much of the UK is prepared to vote only if there was someone who really mattered to the public!\n\nHope my request is taken under consideration.\n\nregards,\nM Ali Syed",
