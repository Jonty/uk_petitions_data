        "background": "There is no unequivocal medical evidence to show that helmet wearing helmet protects cyclists. In fact cyclists wearing helmets are more likely to be involved in a collision with a motorist as motorists assume such a cyclist is more competent and therefore take additional risks when driving near one. Further, every country in which this law has been introduced, levels of cycling have plummeted - thereby negating any perceived 'benefits'.",
