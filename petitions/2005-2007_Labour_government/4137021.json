            "background": "The way the Science GCSE module multiple choice exam questions are written, are purposely difficult to understand in an attempt to make the exam harder. \nIn a good exam - the questions should be strightford and easy to understand, but the 'answer' should require skill and knowledge to answer. \nThe reason that the recent computer marked exam questions have been made difficult to understand is an attempt to make the multichoice sytle exame harder to answer, as the computers can't mark written text. \nThis means people are being tested to see how well they understand badly written questions - and not the exam subject.\nThis discriminates against people with dyslexia, or who do not understand written instructions, and has the danger of becoming a exam about understanding questions rather then checking for the knowledge that people have in that area. \nI have seen a lot of similar tests that are computer marked and this is not a fare way to test people.\nThis must be reviewed before the end of the school year or the government may be sued in the future for unfair exams.",
