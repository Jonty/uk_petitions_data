        "background": "Universities increasingly offer and premote degree courses which bear no relation to the needs of Industry and Businesses. This system has led to the current situation whereby there are far to many British graduates who cannot find employment befitting their qualifications and not enough that can meet the actual needs of industry and businesses.  We urge the government to force universities into only promoting and offering industry-driven degree courses that are relevant to the needs of British businesses and lead people onto suitable employment.",
