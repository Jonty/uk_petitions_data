            "background": "if you are a careing for a disabled person, whether out of choice or sence of duty, you are expected to also maintain a clean living environment, as should be.  but no help is given to the carer for this.  the only way the disabled person has help with domestic cleaning, is if he/she has help off social services for washing/dressing ect. a spouse who is also disabled, and is soul carer, is not entitled to any help with cleaning the family home if they are able to bathe, dress and cook for them selves. the carer is expected to cook, clean, bathe, dress and lift the disabled spouse if nessasry, alone. even when they them selves are disabled.  yet a healthy profesional carer, by law is not allowed to lift a person alone.  more attention could be given to the disabled spouse, if the healthier of the two had more time to give, instead of worrying about the general domestic duties, or lifting their spouse which could cause stress for the carer and disabled spouse.\n  more domestic help for carers needed",
