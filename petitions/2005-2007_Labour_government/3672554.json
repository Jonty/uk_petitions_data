            "background": "Mr Blair's government have recently rejected the BBC's request for a reasonable increase in the license fee, in fact implementing an increase below inflation. This is because of his embarassment over Iraq and the Hutton Report. We must recognise what good value the license fee is, particularly after watching programmes such as Planet Earth, Match Of The Day, Top Gear, Question Time, Mighty Boosh etc. It is so nice to not have programmes interrupted by rechid adverts. Let's get behind this institution we can be proud of which represents us brilliantly across the wider world.",
