Market element will cross- subsidise the construction of the affordable housing and all new housing should incorporate substantial office areas for home working. This will reduce road congestion, ensure the delivery of much -needed social housing, address the overall shortfall of housing nationally, support local services such as schools, post offices etc and will allow young people to stay in the villages where they grew up.",
