When I asked for feedback on the interview, I was informed that I had failed due to my credit history.\nThis seems a ludicrous reason not to employ someone, who is capable and more than willing to do an honest day's work in order to better themselves and to clear any outstanding debts.  This is a very unfair way of vetting someone at interview level, especially if the potential employee is in debt due to circumstances beyond their control.\nThis kind of vetting should be abolished and made illegal.",
