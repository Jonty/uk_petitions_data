            "background": "One of the first stealth taxes introduced in Gordon Brown\u2019s 1997 budget was to stop the tax break that allowed pension schemes to claim a tax credit on the dividend payments for shares owned by pension schemes. Experts estimate this has taken \u00a35 billion a year out of the pension system and has contributed to the decline in pension funding and resulted in reduced investment returns. We call on the government to put back this \u00a35 billion a year into the private pension system and consult with the finance industry on the best way of doing this in order to help restore confidence in the pension system.",
