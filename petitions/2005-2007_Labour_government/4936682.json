            "background": "Employees that are injured at work, where the company are guilty of bad practise should not have to suffer financially by being on SSP whilst waiting for their claim to be dealt with by solictors, these employees have worked hard and long hours and when they are off work due to illness ie stress they are put through the extra stress of financially not being able to cope, claims should be settled within 30days of date of application, this will stop all the bad practise that is on going especially company's that have supporting people (government) funding. It is rediculous the way these employees are abused and compensation should be swift and in there favour.",
