            "background": "The Learning Skills Council chairman has said that they are looking for more commercial involvement with FE courses to replace central government funding. Since 1989 we have lost half of our FE colleges. We urge the government to withdraw from this path to privatisation and market force ethos. The dumbing down of education is an inevitable outcome of having a commercial market ethos since the pressure is always to get something for less. \n\nThe government obsession with league tables and measuring supposed achievement is a sign of insecurity and cannot hide the real deterioration of the education system. \n\nWe ask that FE funding for Foundation Art & Design Courses be fully backed as they are vital springboards for creativity in the art and design industries. UK creativity is under direct threat, our long standing global reputation in the Arts and Design sectors is sadly being destroyed. Defend TRUE EDUCATION!",
