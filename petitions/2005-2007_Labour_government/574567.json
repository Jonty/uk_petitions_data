            "action": "endorse a motion that would see the future plans for road pricing and current road fund licence (car tax) scrapped in favour of an increased Fuel Duty Tax which would also include third party insurance.",
            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "There are currently approx. 27 million vehicles on our roads and each year a proportion of their drivers are uninsured. \n\nThe adding an insurance element to the Fuel Duty would make insurance compulsory and overall, the actual increase per year would be very small if each and every road fuel user contributed. The insurance itself should be on a Third Party Only basis, the minimum that you need however, a more comprehensive policy could still be offered by standard motor insurance companies. The overall effect should be that those subscribing to Fully Comprehensive Insurance should see a reduction, as there are more people insured by default.\n\nThe road pricing issue could be again tackled by simply adding the licence fund to fuel duty. Those that use the larger engined, most fuel hungry vehicles will pay more by default in terms of consumption, those that sit in the most congested areas will pay more unless they have a biofuel or electric vehicle.",
