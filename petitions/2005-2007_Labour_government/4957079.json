            "background": "In recenty years, the UK Eurovision Song Contest entry has been notoriously bad.  After 27 June 2007, Tony Blair will have plenty of free time on his hands and we believe that a valuable use of his time would be to write and perform our entry next year.  It is well known that, had things turned out differently for the young Mr Blair, he could have made it as an internationally renowned pop star with his band, the Ugly Rumours.",
