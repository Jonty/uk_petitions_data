            "background": "It appears that thousands of companies have received a \u00a3900 P35 tax penalty notice for the apparent non-filing of P35's last May even though they have filed them on line. With the HRMC not advising of a 'problem' with filing until 9 months later the fine (at \u00a3100 per month) has built up to \u00a3900 for everyone which is completely unfair. The tax offices are also now in apparent meltdown trying to deal with appeals. This amounts to a cruel tax on small businesses - why can't the HRMC advise of any problems with filing one month after the deadline?",
