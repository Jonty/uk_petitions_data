        "background": "EMA (Educational Maintainence Allowence) is a system that is designed to provide a form of benifit for under privilaged teenagers so they can stay on into the 6th form.\n\nThis system completly undermines hard working pupils and pupils' who's parents combined income is just over the \u00a330,000 cutoff point. It doesn't take into account savings of parents and can mean that sometimes the people who need it aren't nessesarily the ones that recieve it. \n\nIn addition to this, if you recieve EMA, you also qualify for bonuses up to \u00a3100 for completing coursework on time. This is very unfair for the normal pupils that work hard and recieve nothing. The cutoff has to be raised or the system abolished.",
