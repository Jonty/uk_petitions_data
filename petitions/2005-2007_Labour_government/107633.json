            "background": "I would like to see either the nit nurse back into our schools or for the teachers to be allowed to check our children's hair.  I am repeatedly treating my daughter for headlice, she has had them 4 times in 3 months.  You get parents like myself who check their child(rens) hair every night after school, we treat our child(ren) if we find anything but this is pointless if they go to school the next day and are reinfested.  Surely it is much better to pay a nit nurse than for GPs to prescribe free treatments, or like myself, just run to the nearest chemist to purchase it, as the doctors have to actually see the headlice before they will prescribe.  Please sIgn this petition and help us to do something for our children.",
