If a driver is banned you cant fine him for speeding etc, secondly you would have less strain on the magistraits courts system as fewer people would counterclaim speeding fines. Most do when they are at the limit of their points. This system has not been reviewed for decades. Instigate a fairer penalty system speed and finance related.",
