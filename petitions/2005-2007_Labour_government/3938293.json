            "background": "Many ex-servicemen and women in the past did not qualify for a service pension because of the number of years they had to qualify and the rules of contract when they signed on. Today those who sign on get a pension for a much greater reduced period. This is an unfair ruling that discriminates against ex servicemen and women some of whom served in hostile areas of the world in defence of their goverment and country.",
