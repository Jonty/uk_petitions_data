If the employees worked in a factory the employer would be bound by the relevant act to provide full training to operate any machinery. The same should apply to the anyone employed to ride a motor cycle or scooter as part of their employment. Make the employers pay for full licence training with additional insurance, This is stastically one of the most dangerous jobs in the UK.",
