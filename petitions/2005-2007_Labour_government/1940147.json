            "background": "The English, their customs, traditions & festivals are constantly under attack from PC Idiots! The government, local councils & schools are always trying to change or ban things associated with English-Christian traditions, customs & festivals. Well, let me intorduce you to human rights! It's a violation of human rights to attempt to ban or change our traditions, customs & festivals for the petty whims of another culture! Political correctness is one sided, against the English & Christianity - it's racism & fascism whichever way you look at it! This government is not fit to hold office for their human rights violations against the English & Christianity. Tolerance is not a word I'd use - RESPECT, respect for the English, for Christianity, respect for our traditions, customs, festivals & culture. Respect it or don't live or come here. We should not have to change our way of life to suit the petty whims of another culture who have little respect for our culture.",
