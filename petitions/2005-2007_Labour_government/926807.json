Better still; why not treat women as the adults we are by allowing US to decide, in the light of what only each individual knows about her own circumstances, whether or not she needs an abortion?  Why, in this day and age, is it not possible for a woman to go to her G.P. and request an abortion in the same way as contraception?  Foetuses are only POTENTIALLY, not ACTUALLY, \"unborn babies\"; they could be miscarried at any point in the pregnancy.",

            "background": "I think it's fairly self-explanatory but I feel, very strongly, that each individual's body belongs ONLY to him/her and no one else has the right to tell him/her what to do with it or to interfere in any decision on this made by any individual.  Specifically with reproduction issues: since it is the unwillingly pregnant woman who, without the option of abortion, would have to endure the hours of agony of child-birth, and then, in almost all cases, continue to be responsible for the resultant child, surely it is only fair to allow her to decide whether she feels able to go through with this.",
