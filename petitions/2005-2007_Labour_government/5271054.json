            "background": "Many migrants have flooded England, claiming endless benefits. Many of whom can not speak a word of English. The people of England did not want to Enter the EU, now because of the Government's arrogance, blindess and failure to listen and allow a public vote, the hard working tax paying English above all, are paying a very high price for this HUGE mistake. It is time to take back control of our borders, close our country to migrants and start making it compulsory for those seeking to live and work here, to learn the English language at their own expense. how can one live and work here if they can not speak the primary language or refuse to?. We have had enough. The time for talk is over, time for action is here. Do we close our borders and make migrates learn English at their expense, and those that do not conform are forbidden to stay? Fair's fair, for fair play.",
