In the south east, we currently waste daylight at 5, 6 or 7 am for well over half the year yet need lights at 8, 9  or 10 pm, generating completely unnecessary emissions.  Lighter evenings mean more can be done outdoors and children are apparently safer during daylight hours, of which there would be more after school. Furthermore, we'd all save money by moving clocks forward.",
