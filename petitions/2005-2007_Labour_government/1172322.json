            "background": "There must be two separate interest rates set for the country of GB, one for London and one for the rest of GB. The remaining population outside of London should not be made to suffer at the greedy over inflated salaries of the Finance Industry. The government must have a responsibility in being fair to everyone else who does not work in the Finance Industry. Salaries, house prices, etc, etc, have a much lower inflation rate than the City of London and must therefore not be used in the equation to set interest rates for the UK.",
