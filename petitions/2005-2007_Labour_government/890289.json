This is not fair. \n\nIf the stats show that more people of Chinese origin crash than any other ethnic group, should we raise the cost of insurance for the Chinese?  Of course not, as this would be racist, in exactly the same way as the current system is sexist.\n\nHow can we be a society that promotes equal opportunity to all when the cost of your car insurance is reflected by your gender? I have had 2 accidents and deserve to pay more than those that have not.  \n\nEveryone should start on a flat rate regardless of gender and your fee then reflects YOUR driving habits and not those of your gender before you.",
