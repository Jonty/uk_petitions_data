        "background": "Organisations are using 0870 and 0845 numbers more and more frequently. These numbers generate revenue for them but they give the excuse that people out of their geographical region will find it cheaper to call them on these numbers. This may have been the case once upon a time, but now with many call providers giving almost free calls to 01/02 telephone numbers, it is more expensive to call the money generating numbers that companies publicise so much.",
