These are such high profile inquiries, due to the importance to the UK economy of the figures they provide. The risk posed to the quality of data we provide is immeasurable. I implore all those who are concerned about the quality of Pensions Fund and Insurance data to join me in this petition, that we might forward it to Senior Management.",
