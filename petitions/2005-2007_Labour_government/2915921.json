            "background": "Anyone who has been to St. Ives (Cornwall), will understand how bad the car parking situation is in the town. Daytrippers should use a park and ride service, with new car parks built nearby, and leave the 'in-town' ones for long-stay holidaymakers. When you've driven hours to get there for a holiday, the last thing you want is to find there is nowhere to park to unload your suitcases, and find yourself lugging a week's worth of supplies a mile across town to your cottage/hotel. \nI propose they make the small in-town car parks long stay and build ample spaces just out of town with a park and ride service for day visitors.\nI would imagine that this would ease congestion around the narrow cobbled streets, which were hardly built for traffic, and so make for a more pleasant stay for everyone concerned.",
