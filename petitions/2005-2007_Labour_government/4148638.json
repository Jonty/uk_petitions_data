            "background": "STOP THE WAR ON THE 4X4..on the basis of 'PROHIBITATION OF DISCRIMINATION' under the BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS LAWS owners and drivers of 4x4 vehicles should only be liable to pay the same amount of Road Fund Vehicle Licence Duty per annum as any other Family type Vehicle legally in use on roads in the UK on the basis that both vehicles would have to conform to the same MOT emissions test and as such the 4x4 vehicle is therefore no more damaging to the environment than the other..and if the issue is to then be based on the amount of fuel used per mile by each vehicle then this factor should be discounted as the vehicle that uses more fuel per mile is paying more fuel excise duty per mile which should then disqualify the excessive increase in Road Fund Licience Duty unfairly currently implemented.",
