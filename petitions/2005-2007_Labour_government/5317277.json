            "background": "I read recently about the Which? investigation regarding so-called \"revenue sharing telephone lines\". These are lines suffixed with the numbers 0845,0870 and 0871 usually and the revenue generated from calls is shared between the communications service provider and the company/body using the telephone line. The calls are more expensive than a number dialled on a local exchange and apparently the benefits agency made more than a quarter of a million pounds profit from phone calls to their 0845 numbers last year even though that person could be calling them from just a few miles away! Profit from people who can least afford it. This morning I called my local police station regarding a non-urgent incident only to find they have now changed to an 0845 number; until recently their number was on the local exchange. As the police are a publicly funded body I fail to see why the British taxpayer should pay for calling expensive phone lines which result in profit for public bodies. The police force are just one example of this, other publicly funded bodies seem to be following suit. Even if the profit does go to a good cause you don't get a choice in the matter.",
