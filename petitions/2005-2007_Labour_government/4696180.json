        "background": "it seems to be the in thing now with companies such as BT,SKY and quite a few utility companies to charge those who would rather not use direct debit an admin fee of up to five pounds.Not only will this be seen as discrimination to those without bank accounts and those who don't have DD facilities but it will most likely cause hardship for those who don't have bank accounts  and to the eldery and infirm who usually see no other way to pay regular bills other than with cash.\nThe charge could be seen as another tax on the the low income families ect as it would be them who would feel the levy hit home the most,at bests it is just blatant profiteering by companies eager to boost annual profits",
