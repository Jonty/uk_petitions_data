            "background": "It seems that an assumption is being made by many that an idea that has the support of millions is better than an idea only supported by one person. History shows us that one persons idea (gravity, natural selection, the espresso machine) are always superior to those held by millions (fascism, Marxism, Islam and supporting Manchester United). The Prime Minister should ignore all ideas held by more than 1 person and only respond to original suggestions from individuals. Please do not sign my petition.",
