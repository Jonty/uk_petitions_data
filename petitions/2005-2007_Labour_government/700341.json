            "background": "The Government (Customs & Exise) are bringing into effect that all agricultural machines will be required to use non rebated diesel (Derv) unless they are used soley for the use in agricultural operations. This is appropriate for those using agricultural tractors for non agricultural and goods transportation and these operators have to comply with the same legislation and rules that apply to HGV's.\n  For the purpose of this petition, we that restore, re-furbish, show at rallies and working events and take part in road-runs and other such charitable events, these machines should not have to use derv as this would have an adverse affect on the charities that we suport and collect hundreds of thousands of pounds each year for to help fund local and international charities.\n  This legislation is ill though out and will destroy the heritage that we are trying to preserve for future generations to enjoy and learn from.",
