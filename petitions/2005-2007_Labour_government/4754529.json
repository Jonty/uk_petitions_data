He now suffers from a disease which threathens his eyesight but can not receive help until he goes blind in one eye although there is treatment available to help him.\n\nI wonder, if this was a Government Minister, would they have to suffer the same. If the Lord Chancellor is able to spend hundreds of thousands of pounds on decorating his public residence, then \u00a36k is a pittance.",
