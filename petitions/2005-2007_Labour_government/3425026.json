            "background": "The huge increases in Business Rates for High St and off High St shops is costing small retailers more and more. It has got to the point where many are closing down as people buy more from the internet and supermarkets. The only way to stop this decline is to reduce small businesses rates. The alternative is shuttered retail units and an end to local shops. This will put people out of work and close town centres.",
