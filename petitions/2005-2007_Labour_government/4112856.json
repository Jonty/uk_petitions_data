            "background": "In the last 30 years since abortion has been legalised under the 1967, there has been huge advancement in medical science and particularly in the filed of ultrasound. We now know that by the time many women become aware of pregnancy if they undergo ultrasound scan, especially now that 4-D (four-dimensional) ultrasound is widely avaialble, the baby's heart will be already identifiable and is described as viable pregnancy. We need the public to debate the implications of stopping the beating heart of a baby tissue.",
