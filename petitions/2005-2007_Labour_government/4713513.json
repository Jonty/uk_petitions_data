        "background": "Under the existing tax credits system, the goverment will provide your family with 'help to pay childcare costs' to allow both of you to return to work.  This can be as much as \u00a3175 a week for one child (max \u00a3300 for more than one child).  This is as much as a parent returning to full-time work on a minimum wage can hope to make.  Why will the goverment pay a stranger to look after your child but not you?  There should be an option for a parent to take this 'help with childcare costs' as taxable income for themselves.  In fact, this money should not be limited only to those who qualify for tax credits, but to a much higher proportion of the population (although, still means tested in some way).  For example, in France either parent can recieve \u00a3550 a month for 'parental leave' to stay at home for the first 3 years of their child's life (or return to work).  The UK has a one of the lowest birth rates in Europe, France has one of the highest.  I wonder why?",
