Paramedics will burn out very quickly,and recruitment/retention will suffer rapidly.And people will die...As a Paramedic you cannot do your job properly without a properly trained colleague.\n\nPLEASE think about what you are doing to our Emergency Services, this will be a massive step backwards.",
