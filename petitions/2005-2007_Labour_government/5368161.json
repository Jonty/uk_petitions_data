        "background": "The decision to give knighthood to salman rushdie is very unthoughtful and very insensitive. It has hurt the feelings of millions of Muslims around the world who think that to honor a man who disgraced their religion is utterly insensitive. \n\nThe timing of this event make it even more worse as already many Muslims are being thought of as being terrorists and such act is only making the situation worse. \nUK always intervene in other countries matters if there is injustice being done but to do some think in their own country can not and should not be overlooked.\nTherefore we request that her majesty the Queen should be asked to take the decision of giving salman Rushdie knighthood back.",
