            "background": "All learner drivers must take a min of 80hrs Training with a DSA Registered PDI/ADI,after they have taken & passed the theory and HPT. \n& Before they can apply for the practicl driving test.The application form must be signed by the PDI/ADI to say that this was done.\nOnce they pass this test they must then take the Pass Plus course by law, only then would they be given a 1st licence to last for 1 year, and would have to display a pink disc on the car at all times while driving, and then if they have not had any convictions for  any  traffic offence, they would have to take a check test of 2 hours to get there full licence.\nAll PDI/ADIs will only be able to charge a set rate of \u00a322 per hour by law for all lessons without any discounts & this would rise in line with inflation each year. (This would be the starting rate for 2007).\nThe police must also take time to check marked teaching cars to make sure that the teacher is licenced to give lessons for rewards.",
