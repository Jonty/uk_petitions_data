            "background": "It's hard enough preparing for a newborn baby.  I think the sure start grant for \u00a3500.00 should be avaliable to all mothers not just mothers on IS, JS or higher rate WFTC.  During my pregnancy my husband wasn't working and was finding it hard to find a new job because we was married we got a couple of pounds a week TC because I was told I had to support him.  We had so many bill and  a loan and it felt like as soon as I worked all our money was gone.  There is alot of families in this situation and the sure start maternity grant could help a baby get the right start in life.  If a family doesn't have money to get the essentials like nappies and milk it's the child that will suffer.",
