        "background": "The Government has now announced a staged pay award for nurses of 1.5% in April 2007 followed by 1.0% in November.  This award will result in a substantial real terms pay cut for nurses like me.\n\nWith the average wage of a registered nurse being \u00a324,841, this equates to a loss of \u00a3571.34.  \n\nRecent independent research by ICM shows that almost 30% of nurses are considering quitting the NHS because of unsatisfactory pay.  That same poll also found that nurses are so upset by an unjust pay cut that close to two thirds of them are prepared to take industrial action.\n\nIf ministers insist on cutting nurses' pay then staff morale will fall, recruitment and retention levels will collapse, the modernisation programme will falter and patient care will suffer as a consequence. \n\nDaily, I and my nursing colleagues have delivered for patients and we have delivered for this Government. All we ask is a fair day's pay for a more than fair day's work.",
