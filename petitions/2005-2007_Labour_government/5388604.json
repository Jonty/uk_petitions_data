        "background": "We believe that the EU Reform Treaty will transfer most of the United Kingdom's remaining sovereignty to the EU through the following mechanisms:\nA European Head of State; An EU diplomatic corps and foreign minister; A common system of criminal justice and a European Public Prosecutor; The abolition of 40 national vetoes;\nBestowing on the EU the \u2018legal personality\u2019 and treaty-making powers of a sovereign state;\nReducing Britain\u2019s voting strength in Council of Ministers meetings by 30 per cent.\n\nAll three parties including the Labour Party  promised a referendum on such changes at the 2005 general election. We believe that they should stand by their manifesto commitments, and that the Reform Treaty should come into effect only following approval in a national referendum.",
