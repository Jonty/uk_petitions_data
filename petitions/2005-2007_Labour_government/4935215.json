            "background": "I feel that in this day and age, the sunday trading law, needs to be changed, as it is not modern enough, you are allowed to drink 24 hours in some places yet cannot do a weekely gocery shop after 4pm on a sunday afternoon, i cannot see why shops have to close at 4pm on a sunday, church goers attend church on a sunday morning, so it has no adverse affect on them, long gone are the days when sundays involved eating roast dinner and staying in, i am sad to say, this law needs changing to keep in line with the modern world. so if you would like to see longer trading hours on a sunday please sign up to this petition!!",
