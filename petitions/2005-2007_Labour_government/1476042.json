            "background": "Are you fed up of seeing bus shelters smashed? Do you think it is a waste of public money for these shelters to be fitted with glass? I hate seeing the glass on the floor, which is also a health hazard to children and animals. Vandals seem to target these so it's time to STOP putting glass in shelters. An excuse is its toughened glass and is not easy to break...the people who do smash them have all night to do it and not many people will stop them because they fear for their own safety.",
