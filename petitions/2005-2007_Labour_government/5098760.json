        "action": "Prevent the home secretary from using the absconding of three people under control orders as an excuse to bypass European Human Rights legislation",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "The current administration has, in the past, held so-called \"terror-related suspects\" against their will without charge or trial. Such a strategy has since been deemed illegal under European human rights legislation. The current home secretary has strongly suggested that he may attempt to derogate from this legislation in order to subvert people's human rights and perhaps begin to imprison people without charge or trial again. He is using the absconding of three so-called \"terror-related suspects,\" who were subject to control orders, as an excuse to introduce such legislation. These suspects have not been charged with any crime, nor have they been tried for any crime.\n\nWe must do our best to try to stop such a gross violation of basic human rights. If there is evidence of someone's terrorist activities or involvement, it should be usedto charge the individual and try them in a court of law. If there is no such evidence, then such individuals should not be restricted in their freedom.",
