        "background": "Create a secure R&D facility to explore the principles of clean free energy such as Zero Point Energy (ZPE) and bring this to the open market for ALL to use.  \nEmployee a team of scientists and engineers and produce a device which could be implemented into our society in about 5 years.  The cost for this R&D would roughly require \u00a3500m in funds and we could have something viable to use in homes, buildings and transportation systems, thus eliminating fossil fuels forever.\nThe possibilities for this new energy are endless and could provide us with a quantum leap in having clean, cheap and decentralised energy for the whole world, thus eliminating poverty and restoring the environment.\nThe west awoke in 2006 to the vast economic, political and social implications of climate change - and realised that it presented as many opportunities as threats to humanity.",
