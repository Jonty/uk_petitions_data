        "background": "As the world's 2nd largest rainforest, the Congo rainforest supports 40 million people across 6 nations and is home to some of Africa's most iconic wildlife including gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and forest elephants.  It is also vital for regulating local and global climate. \n\nDespite a moratorium on new logging (since 2002) over 15 million hectares have been granted to the logging industry - an area over SEVEN TIMES the size of Wales.\n  \nThe World Bank is failing to stop the havoc this destruction brings as the rainforest is being sold under the misconception that it will alleviate poverty.  Taxes paid by the companies to log the forest should be going to local communities to provide essential services however over the last 3 years, not a single penny has reached these communities.\n\nThere is still time to prevent this destruction and see that alternative solutions are developed to lift the area out of poverty.",
