            "background": "The NHS is an important institution in our country, and one for which most of us are extremely grateful.  \n\nSince many of us feel that we have too few public holidays in the UK, we could have one on the 5th of July to celebrate what was a revolution in health-care, and (in my opinion) a great step forward for civilisation in the provision of necessary medical care even to those who couldn't afford it.  The fact that we still benefit from this deserves to be celebrated.",
