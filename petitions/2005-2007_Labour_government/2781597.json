            "background": "On March 6th Manchester City Council will consider the introduction of new laws that will result in \u00a380 on-the-spot fines for allowing dogs off their leads in 11 popular parks (including Heaton Park, Beech Road, Ardwick Green and others throughout Manchester).\n\nThere will be additional no-go zones in 97 parks and fines for allowing dogs to roam on ANY Manchester Street.\n\nWhilst we recognise that dangerous dogs must be controlled at all times, the majority of dogs benefit from off-lead exercise, free interaction and association with other animals. In addition dog owners enjoy the benefit of exercise that would be lessened by walking dogs only on the lead.\n\nThese laws are excessive and unnecessary. The majority of dog owner are responsible and this is yet another attempt to infringe human rights. Manchester City Council should enforce current legislation designed to police irresponsible dog owners rather than waste money with new laws that would be unpopular and difficult to enforce.",
