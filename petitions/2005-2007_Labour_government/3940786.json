            "background": "The \"first past the post\" system of voting is disproportional, and representationally unsound. It makes it impossible for the political minority of an area to have their votes taken into consideration. Each general election, probably about 20% of the British voters do not receive any representation from their parties in Parliament.  \n      Proportional Representation takes       into account the minority votes, and splits up Parliament into how many votes the party got, not how many the candidate got in a particular area. It means that the minority voters can still have their representation in Parliament. \n       And it's just nicer. =)",
