            "background": "Currently aviation fuel is tax exempt while trains in the UK have to pay full tax on fuel. This amounts to an unofficial subsidisation of the aviation industry with which trains cannot fairly compete. We encourage the government to abolish tax on train fuel to create equal market conditions, therefore encouraging lower train ticket prices and greater train use, as an incentive for more environmentally sustainable travel.",
