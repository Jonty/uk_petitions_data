            "background": "A system of selecting members of the lords that works in a similar way to jury service would overcome a number of issues that face a fully elected upper house; \n\nA house selected by this method will overcome the under representation of many groups in the political process. \n\nIt is hard to imagine how the primacy of the commons would be threatened by an upper house selected in this way.   \n\nIf members were selected by proportional representation then groups with minority views but highly motivated members would be over represented in national government, as voter apathy would play a very significant role.",
