            "background": "Atheists bully Christians, they did it in the past to jews and now they are especially targeting Muslims.  Anyone who believes in God should be allowed to practice their religon without being bullied and told their backward, unscientific, and being forced and bullied into accepting things against teir beliefs (evolution in schools, gay adoption and rights, pre-marrital affairs etc).  Also, it is actually religous teachings that promote justice, fairness, equality, thinking of others, unselfishness telling the truth and good manners and being good which are now missing in people in replace of greed, covertness, selfishness, etc.  so these things should be highlighted and not so-called un-religious terrorism (which no real believer in God endorses), fanaticism etc",
