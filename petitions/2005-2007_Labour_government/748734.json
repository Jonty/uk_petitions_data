        "background": "As citizens of your country, we are asking you to introduce a ban on these products without delay. There is support from all over the world and it is time for some action to be taken in the UK and Europe. It is estimated that over 2 million cats and dogs are raised under appalling conditions in Asia and then cruelly slaughtered for their furs and skins to supply the EU market. These products then enter EU unlabelled or with false labeling and consumers, as well as small merchants are often duped into believing they are buying or selling faux fur. This is why the introduction of strict labeling would have little or no effect as it is unlikely to represent a strong enough deterrent of these items.  We urge you, to introduce a UK wide ban on the import, export, trade and production of these items. It is important that you make this a priority issue in order to underline the British public that the UK government will not allow this fraudulent,cruel and sick trade to continue in our country",
