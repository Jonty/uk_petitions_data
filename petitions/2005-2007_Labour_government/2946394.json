            "background": "Air-freighted food and food which has travelled far has recently become the subject of a lot of negative publicity because of the perceived damage it does to the environment. Threats by organisations to ban or restrict air freighted produce have caused serious concern amongst African producers who rely on being able to trade with the West, often by airfreight. We believe that it is unfair to target air-freight and food miles that is helping to create long-term sustainable development in the developing world and would therefore ask that such products are not banned or restricted.",
