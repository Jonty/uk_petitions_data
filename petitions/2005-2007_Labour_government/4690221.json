            "background": "Green miles scheme. This is an informal locally-based car sharing idea routed in the good will and generosity of communities towards neighbours near and far, particularily OAPs and students. By cutting the top 3 inches from a green plastic garden rubbish bag (easiest while still folded)a sash is made.\nOne such sash worn across chest and shoulder or draped diagonally over the back of a car seat would signal a readiness to give lifts or two such sashes, crossed over, would indicate a readiness to give as well as swop lifts.\nCar insurers have long recognised the benefits of car sharing schemes and their policies usually make this plain, provided a profit is not made (so a charge is possible). We trust nobody would take advantage of others. After checking their insurance policy we hope lots of drivers with 1-3 empty seats will consider taking part*.\nIt's idealistic enough to work and we would welcome the Minister for Transport on board!
