            "background": "MPs are elected by us! When elected they should do everything they can to represent their constituents and voice their concerns in parliament. However a lot of voters would agree that MPs do little or nothing to represent them. One of the problems is that MPs have a conflict of interest (ie business ventures which they pursue), so their full time is not spent representing the electorate. I think the public should be allowed a binding referendum on whether we think this is acceptable.",
