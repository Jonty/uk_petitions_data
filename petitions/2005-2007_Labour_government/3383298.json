        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "District wide 'one size fits all' planning policies of affordable housing targets and new Intermediate Market products do not work.  PPS 3 needs to strongly recommend that Local Authorites develop a simple multi-type approach to affordable housing.  For example in an area of high proportion social housing, new housing should strongly be focused on private and some IM products (85%-15%).  In high owner occupied areas, new housing should have an element of owner occupied housing, some social housing and some intermediate (70%, 20% 10%).  Only then can we acheive more balanced and 'sustainable' communities.",
