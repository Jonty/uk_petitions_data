            "background": "I am constantly left wondering why we are still producing and importing new vehicles with ever bigger and and less economical engines than 90% of people need\n\nI therefore would request that fuel be rationed on a Gallons per driver basis with each driver entitled to only ONE vehicle.  \ni.e. 5 gallons of fuel/week to use as required that is to say if you feel the need to drive a 12MPG vehicle you may do so but your range would be 60 miles \nWhereas if you drive a small hatch back doing 40 MPG your fuel allowance would enable you to cover 200 miles\nthis way we would all be made to make only essential journeys with an incentive to use a more enviromental friendly vehicle\n\nThis still leaves individual choice of vehicle but limits us ALL to the same amount of enviromental damage\n\nThe big Plus of this is the driver is not being subjected to EVER MORE road and vehicle taxes which do NOT improve the enviroment they only imply that it's OK to keep Killing the planet so long as you Pay to do it",
