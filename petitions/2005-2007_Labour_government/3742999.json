        "background": "Here in the UK British people are being forced into unemployment to allow for foreign people to work here for cheaper wages compared to British workers. The govenment are ignoring the fact that if employers are paying foreign people less for working those companies are paying less taxes yet getting help from the govenment as well. As an example my wife and I (with 1 child under 2 years old) are unemployed and unskilled and for either of us to work we would have to bring home \u00a316,000 a year which in todays employment market for unskilled people is impossible thanks to cheaper foreign workers.",
