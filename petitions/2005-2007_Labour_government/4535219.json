            "background": "Military vehicles are frequently among the poorest performing in terms of fuel efficiency and CO2 emissions. In addition, bombs and ammunition can cause damage to human health and the environment.\n\nWe ask the Prime Minister to develop more environmentally friendly tanks, armoured troop carriers and warplanes, which are more fuel efficient and produce less environmentally damaging emissions.\n\nWe ask that in future, bombs and ammunition should not contain any chemical substances that are damaging to the environment or human health.\n\nAll new weapons should undergo safety checks, so that they are not only safe to the operator, but safe for the health of those they are used upon.",
