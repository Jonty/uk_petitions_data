            "background": "Car Boot Sales are an effective and popular \"no pain\" means of recycling unwanted household items that would otherwise be dumped. Many local authorities limit them to 14 per year in any one place if planning permission is not obtained. This is completely illogical at a time when we are continually being exorted to recycle everything, rather than throw it away. To encourage the \"re use\" part of the recycling triangle, this petition seeks to increase this to 28 a year, with the proviso that the sale should consist primarily of non - trade sellers of second - hand household goods. Councils should be actively encouraging these events, as well as similar events such as Jumble Sales, etc, to cut down on land fill.",
