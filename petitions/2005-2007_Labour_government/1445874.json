            "background": "im not a soldier but understand (as much as people don't like it) that the military might we have is very important for the security of our country. there is a big problem with service men leaving and getting new recruits. the simple answer is to make it into a real career, by raising the age of entry and paying more towards the soldier by means of eqpt, standard of living and wages. i believe that for a private to risk his life abroad doesn't get much over \u00a31000 a month, when a private security operative would get close to \u00a35000. remember it was the soldier in WW2 who gave the activist the right of freedom and speech. if we didn't have a military(army, navy, air force)might we would be ruled by invaders like Hitler. \n\n  the equipment is rubbish, their are too many children fighting wars, and the money is so low that any adult in his right mind would turn his nose up at the pay packet. would you work for below minimum wage to risk your life abroad?",
