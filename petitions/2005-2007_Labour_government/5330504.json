            "background": "This is to put a stop to a simple exchange of driving licence to a U.K licence from their own licence obtained from outside the U.K where the test to pass the driving test or HGV is of extremely low standard and in some cases just involves driving up and down a one hundred meter road. There is also the issue of not being use to our very complex roads and signs. Anyone wishing to drive on the U.K roads must undertake a U.K driving test, it is a must to save lives.",
