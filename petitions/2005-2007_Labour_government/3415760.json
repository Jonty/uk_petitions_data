            "background": "The wording on food packaging, including food storage and cooking instructions is too small to be easily read by most people. There is usually sufficient space to have all the information shown in an easily readable font size but for marketing and aesthetic reasons manufacturers choose to minimise the lettering size to make it unreadable for a large number of people.\n\nAs the wording is mostly on the back of the packaging there is no excuse for not making it readable.\n\nI would like legislation to force manufacturers to ensure that their lettering is not smaller than a generally accepted font size - in line with standards for readability that exist for web site designers.\n\nThe lack of standards poses a potential health and safety risk for people who misread instructions and is also a real inconvenince for a large number of people.",
