Firstly the 18% share holding of ITV Plc, when rival NTL Inc [now Virgin Media] where conceding bidding for ITV. ASA is currently looking into two count of BskyB using misleading advertising, which has promoted an Early Day Motion, number 935. BSkyB has withdrawn basic channels from Virgin Media, locking people out of content who subscribe and locked into a virgin media contact, forcing some customers to consider to change provider from Virgin Media to BskyB. We ask the Right Hon. Prime Minister, Tony Blair to consider asking/telling the Office of Fair Trading to look into BskyB Ltd and its practices urgently. We want to point out that Virgin Media customers would SkyOne Channel back. Thanks.",
