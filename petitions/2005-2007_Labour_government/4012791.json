I believe skirmishers are mature and have the common sense not to go out with their weapons a hurt innocent people.\n\nIts silly boys and girls with \u00a35 BB pistols that have risen this bill and endangered a massive world wide sport.\n\nKeep Airsoft alive, show the UK how big Airsoft is and how important it is to us!",
