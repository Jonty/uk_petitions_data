            "background": "This petition is designed to bring back the tried and tested tradition of witch trials to this great land. \n\nIf first hand evidence is to be believed there used to be countless witches. Until great men helped rid the land of the witch plague that haunted it. Unfortunatly this doesn't mean we can afford to get complacent. With the rise of Harry Potter and his friend THE DEVIL all of the good work of the past could be undone. This is your chance to make a real difference. \n\nGood night and good luck",
