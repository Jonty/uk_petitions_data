            "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
            "background": "LGVs (formerly HGVs) are currently restricted to 40mph on single carriageway roads. When LGVs adhere to this limit it leads to suicidal overtaking attempts by smaller vehicles. When LGVs travel at 50mph drivers of cars are more likely to follow than attempt a suicidal overtake. A 20mph differential in  speed limits for different vehicles on the same road is dangerous, archaic and anachronistic as modern LGVs have hugely improved braking systems over vehicles of 20+ years ago, and PCVs (coaches etc.) already have a 50mph limit. This proposal can only be a benefit to road safety.",
