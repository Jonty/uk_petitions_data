            "background": "I think that the Prime Minister should relax the Firearms Act 1997, to allow the private use of pistols for target shooting in police approved ranges. Even if it means that weapons must be stored at the range and not in people's private homes, this is a legitimate Olympic sport, which was once enjoyed by many people.\n\nThe banning of this persuit was unjustified by the Dunblane tradgedy. Why must the majority of decent, law abiding citizens always pay for the mistakes of others?",
