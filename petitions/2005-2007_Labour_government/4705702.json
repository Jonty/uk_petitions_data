            "background": "By creating a Crown Colony out of Port Hydneye (Penhurst Close) in the light of the current security situation, the colony would be outside the jurisdiction of the European Union, thus the British State could use it as a holding pen to deport criminals to countries where the death penalty is retained without falling foul of the EU constitution stating that countries may not deport any person to a country where the death sentence stands. We can also make money by making our own stamps for collectors.",
