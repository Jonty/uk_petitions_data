        "background": "Legislation to protect citizens and businesses from the amount of Counterfeit and Stolen Goods sold at Online Auctions.\n\nAt the moment Ebay claims to be \"Just a Venue\" this statement absolves theem (Ebay) from any responsibility.\n\nLegislation is needed to force Online Auctions to be more accountable for the goods sold on their websites.\n\nFor example, Ebay has so many frauds that is would be impossible to list them in 1,000 words.\nThere are Illegal Firearms, Stolen Property, Counterfeit DVD's, Video's and computer software on sale any day of the week.\n\nEbays answer is; \"we are just a venue\".\n\nI believe that Online Auctions should be held accountable for the items advertised and sold on its website.\n\nUntill that happens, these items will  continue to be sold, by anonymous sellers that hide behind their Seller names, as happens on Ebay. \n\nIf buyers were to stop and ask themselves; Would I really pay good money to someone that I have never met?\n\nYet that is exactly what is happening every minute of every day on Ebay.",
