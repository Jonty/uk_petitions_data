            "background": "20 people on average are killed weekly by work-related road crashes (HSE/RoSPA statistics).  Employers often cause or contribute to these deaths by excluding driving from their Health & Safety arrangements, placing responsibility on individual drivers' behaviour, not satisfying legal duties to assess/mitigate risk, pressurising by unreasonable targets, occupational hazards - long hours, stress, bullying, and not recognising driving is integral to many peoples\u2019 work.\n\nHSE annual work-related accidents/deaths statistics are wrong, as work-related road incidents are excluded & do not count towards any H&S improvements.\n\nThe Government must immediately: make reportable under RIDDOR all injuries/deaths to workers/the public from work-related traffic incidents, improve enforcement by HSE, local authorities & police of employers\u2019 statutory duties under existing legislation and enable the prosecution of negligent employers for corporate killing.  \n\nPetition nationally endorsed by all TUC trade unions who represent members who drive whilst at work.",
