            "background": "With so many 1000's of free newspapers handed out on the tube, I think its vital that London Underground begin recycling them. Every day staff collect the newspapers and bin them with all other ordinary rubbish. By introducing recycling to London Transport we can make a huge difference to the Environment! The Government and some local councils are enforcing household recycling, I think that it should be enforced on Transport for London too.",
