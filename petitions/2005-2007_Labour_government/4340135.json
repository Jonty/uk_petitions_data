        "background": "In the past NHS dentist were available to all who were resident in the UK. With NHS dentists reducing through switching to private work, dentistry costs have escalated way beyond reasonable growth. There is a great need for an increased provision in NHS dentists or NHS access to a local dentist. Non-NHS dentists should be made to accept a percentage of patients in order to be allowed to practice in the UK. This should be enforced with annual compliance checks on dental practice records to ensure that such practices are maintained.",
