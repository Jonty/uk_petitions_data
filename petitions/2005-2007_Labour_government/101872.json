            "background": "Why should someone under the age of 22 get paid less than an \"adult\" just because they're young? Young people are being exploited by greedy employers and it's time this was ended. The minimum wage is \u00a35.35 per hour for workers aged 22 years and older. For those aged 18-21 there is a \"development rate\" of \u00a34.45 per hour. For those over the compulsory school age and under the age of 18 the minimum wage is a tiny \u00a33.30 per hour. The government claim the minimum wage for 16-17 year olds must be kept low because it will encourage young people to stay in education. I cannot find a reason for the 18-21 \u201cdevelopment rate\u201d. Some youths have to go out and earn a living and they end being exploited by greedy employers. It's time to end this unfair age discrimination! I am campaigning for an equal minimum wage for those over the compulsory school age.",
