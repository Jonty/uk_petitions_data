        "background": "Various efforts are being made to prevent the slaughter of a bull that has reacted positively to a screening test for bovine TB. This slaughter is normal procedure for preventing the spread of this disease both to other animals and to humans, and these efforts should be resisted.\n\nThe Welsh Assembly Government has already neglected its duty to act by indefinitely delaying the slaughter. If this continues, the government should either ban movements of live cattle out of Wales, or put legislation through Parliament to withdraw their powers in this area, and take action itself.",
