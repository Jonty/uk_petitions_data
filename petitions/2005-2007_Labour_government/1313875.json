            "background": "Building a maglev train network and a fleet of maglev trains would reduce travel times between UK cities to the extent that it will compete with internal flights, reduce congestion on the roads and revolutionize the economy.\n\nIt will allow travel times between London to Manchester in just 45 minutes and relativley close by cities such as Liverpool and Manchester will in effect become 'megacities' as travel time between them will be 15 minutes. Track is cheaper to produce then channel tunnel rail links and emits les CO2 than air travel.",
