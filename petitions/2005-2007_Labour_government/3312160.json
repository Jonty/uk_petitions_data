However, this will gain momentum. If not here, somewhere else. So embrace it. \n\nMr Brown, if you're next to take control - keep E-Petitions going. Mr Blair's team has something good here. Don't bin it because it is an old regime idea. \n\nThis E-Petition website should be protected now and not deleted to make way for a big road price website.\n\nThank You.",
