            "background": "Current law permits a bus driver to drive 5\u00bd hours continuous with a maximum 10 hours driving per day. Coach and lorry drivers only drive for 4\u00bd hours continuous with a maximum 9 hours driving per day. Bus companies are expecting their drivers to work the maximum hours permitted by law, which is resulting in tired bus drivers on the road. We would like to see driving time and break time to be brought into line with that of coach and lorry drivers with a maximum working week.",
