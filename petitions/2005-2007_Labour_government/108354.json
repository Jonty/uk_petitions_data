            "background": "The amount of personal debt in the UK now exceeds one trillion pounds (\u00a31,000,000,000,000).  This is not only unsustainable, but has led to an increase in bankruptcies, house repossession and misery for many people.  Part of the problem is that debt is marketed as credit, with all the positive and beneficial connotations that go with this.  Personal credit is, in reality, personal debt - a far more negative concept, that financial institutions (which profit from it) have no interest in acknowledging.  To require such institutions to refer to credit as debt in their marketing and advertising etc would at the very least ensure that people reflected on the implications of entering into contracts of indebtedness with them.",
