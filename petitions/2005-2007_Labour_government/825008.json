        "action": "Cap the amount of community charge & or rise that can be used to pay for beneficial local authority pensions",
        "action_prefix": "We the undersigned petition the Prime Minister to",
        "background": "Many of us working outside government and local authority structures are having to face the fact that pension schemes are not able to meet our expectations without substantial increases in payment. At the same time local authorities are able to increase the community charge (precept for town councils) to the benefit of local authority employee pensions. Greater than inflation increases in council tax reduce the amount of disposable income that we could divert to savings or additional voluntary contributions to our pension scheme. We have no choice but to pay the community charge but it is unfair that our financial position in old age should be compromised to pay better-than-average final salary pensions for local authority employees. This petition calls upon the government to limit the amount of community charge that can be levied for local authority pensions",
