People should STOP selling tickets on eBay for their own profit and let genuine people have a chance to purchase them via authorised means. Live 8 was a prime example how people made money on tickets in which the sale of tickets via authorised sites was for charity, yet on eBay for the greedy eBay sellers profits.  It is time we stopped these ticket hungry, profit orientated people and ban the sale of tickets on eBay.",
