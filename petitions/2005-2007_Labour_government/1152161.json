            "background": "Legislate to require that car boot sales with more than 30 selling pitches be subject to planning controls. At present, Car Boot Sales and similar events can  operate for 14 days a year on any one site under \"permitted development\" rules, unless planning consent is obtained.\n\nI am proposing that the current rules be amended so that an event with more than 30 sellers cannot be held under \"permitted development\" rules, unless planning permission has been obtained thus protecting residents in the local area from unreasonable disruption of their lives and ensuring that proper consideration of the effect that increased traffic may have.",
