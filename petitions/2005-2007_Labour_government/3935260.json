            "background": "There remains a large percentage of TV programmes at BBC ITV BFI & other archives that have never been re-shown since first transmission.\n\nWith the fast changing world of the Interweb, Broadband, video on demand, Youtube and infighting within the TV industry (Sky Virgin) and the rubbish content of our current UK TV Programming.\n\nMr Prime Minister is it not about time we all saw the archives that contain superb programmes from the past, that once made UK Broadcasting the envy of the world.\n\nThis is now the 21st century and people should have the right to see this footage (especially BBC Programmes that WE the licence payers paid for to be made)\n\nPeople no longer want to get hold of this footage for illcit purposes (ie selling it on the black market) just to watch the programmes we grew up with, rather than being force fed the rubbish on TV today.\n\n\nWe thank you for taking the time to read this petition and ask that it can be bought up at a future meeting of the Culture, Media and Sport Commons Committee\n\nYours\n\nThe Undersigned",
