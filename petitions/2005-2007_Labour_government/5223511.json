If members of staff (or the general public) make suggestions of best practice that are beneficial to the residences of their local NHS Trust and PCT. Staff should not loss their pin number or be subject to a disciplinary for putting these suggestions forward. \n\nThe suggestions should be robustly and proactively applied (particularly if they make common sense). Any consultations led by the NHS and PCT should have the transparency and integrity to full fill the remit of any of these consultations and not be done purely as a tick box exercise!\n\nEspecially in the areas or hygiene/cleanliness, budgeting, staffing, allocation of life saving drugs, all race equality issues (applying local race equality schemes), malpractice and abuses towards vulnerable patients. After all we do pay for a service that we are not getting value for money for and the wrong people are being victimised for trying to improve things in the NHS.",
