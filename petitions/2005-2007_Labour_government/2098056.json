            "background": "I would like to see Winter Fuel Payments introduced for people under the current age of 60 who are in receipt of long term disability benefits such as DLA whether this is payable for the care component or mobility component. Most people in receipt of this benefit are on a lower income that pensioners and having a disability can make them also susceptible to the cold weather. I feel it is extremely unfair to expect them to manage on low incomes whilst trying to keep there homes warm. I am all for the Winter Fuel Payments since it was first introduced but I feel that you need to consider the needs of many people who miss out on payments because of the age restriction that you have in place.",
