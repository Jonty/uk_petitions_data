For those frightened of flying and who also smoke, they are already banned from smoking in their aircraft, to ban all smoking areas in airports would be excessive.\n\nAlso; these areas are sealed off from the non-smoking public so the aim of the Bill is still achieved; no non-smokers will be impacted by this exemption.\n\nLast; there are already exemptions for smoking areas within otherwise smoke-free premises e.g. hotel bedrooms and homes for the elderley.",
