            "background": "The car tax is paid annually and is only based on the type of car - not the amount of use.  I always felt this was unfair.  I paid the same (doing 20,000 - 30,000) as my dad (doing 1,000 - 2,000)and the only way I could see to right the imbalance was to pay through petrol.  This would mean that the gas guzzling cars would pay more (green penalty?) and the low users wouldn't be penalised for being green or canny.",
