Our schools can't cope, our hospitals can't cope, we don't have enough housing, our roads can't cope.  In the South East we don't even have enough water!  Even our sewers can't cope, with multiple occupancy by Eastern European immigrants houses that would normally have 2-3 people now have six, they still only pay one council tax bill.  This has nothing to do with racism it is purely common sense that we cannot carry on like this.",
