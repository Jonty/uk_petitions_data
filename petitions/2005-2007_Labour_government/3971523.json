            "background": "At the moment in the UK companies are able to make UK employees redundant in favour of moving their jobs offshore, I believe that Companies should incur penalty charges for doing this which would then be divied out to the employees affected.  This would go some way to help these individuals \\ families and possibly deter companies from doing this in the first place.  Moving work out of the UK at the expense of UK jobs is wrong and will only hurt the economy in the long term.",
