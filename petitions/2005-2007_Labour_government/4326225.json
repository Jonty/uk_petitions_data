            "background": "Learner drivers are not allowed on motorways whilst having lessons and rightly so, but why once they have passed there test they are allowed straight on to a motorway without any lessons of any kind. This petition is to make drivers who have just passed there test sit a motorway competance test before being allowed to use one, at least this way new drivers will not have an excuse for using the motorway incorrectly i.e. sitting in the middle lane of a motorway for no reason",
