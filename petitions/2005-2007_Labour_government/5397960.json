        "background": "A speed camera is to act as a deterant to speed. If someone is speeding then they should be punished. Do not scarp speed camera's because more people will speed. The speed limit is there for a reason and should be objeyed by everyone. \n\nAs Satellite Navigation are more common why not add a mandatory chip in a car using the Satellite Navigation technology to immediatley fine a person when they are in a designated zone breaking the speed limit. This is the only way I see possible of reducing deaths and hospitalisations.",
