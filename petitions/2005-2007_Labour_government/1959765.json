            "background": "Tax credits are about fairness.\n\nContribution would be measured by taxes and dues paid minus any usage from the system (ie healthcare, welfare, education, etc).\n\nThis will not penalise those who genuinely need the use of state provided utilities but would reward those who through effort, determination and action, provide for themselves and keep themselves healthy. With a credit escalator based on net contribution, it could substantially help people in their later years who would considerably benefit for reduced taxes (where is the equity in taxing the income of a pensioner who has paid tax all their working life!)",
