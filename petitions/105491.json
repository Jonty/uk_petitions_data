        "additional_details": "Thousands of migrants are camped near the port of Calais, using every opportunity to evade security measures to travel illegally to Britain, overwhelming the efforts of the French police, our border service, transport drivers, and the operators of the channel tunnel to enforce legitimate border controls. Only armed resistance is likely to get them back under control.",
        "background": "We are currently experiencing unacceptable disruption to trade and travel due to the illegal behaviour of would be immigrants who have no right to enter Britain. Our forces should be deployed in our defence, with authority to use deadly force where they deem appropriate.",
