        "additional_details": "The cost of the road and tunnel route has been estimated by Highways England to be up to \u00a35.9bn. In order to justify this investment, the economic benefits have been estimated to be \u00a37bn buy with little reference to any supporting evidence. \r\n\r\nThe UK Government has been cutting back spending on public services and other projects. There is no evidence of whether the money could be spent more wisely in other areas with potentially greater economic benefits.",
        "background": "The Lower Thames Crossing Option C is set to blight the lives of those who live in its path in Kent and Essex. It will pass though greenbelt areas, damaging the environment.  SE England is already very built up and funding should be directed to other areas of the country. ",
