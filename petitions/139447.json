        "additional_details": "Leaving the EU requires a further treaty before Parliament. It should NOT BE passed without the fundamental rights of each UK citizen GUARANTEED first.\r\n\r\nMr Gove's plan is for a BILL OF RIGHTS to abolish the Human Rights Act when most citizens cannot enforce any current rights. \r\n\r\nRIGHTS TO BE TAKEN AWAY should be subject to REFERENDUM before the Act of Leaving. Limit their power to hurt YOU, your Family, & Fellow Citizens. SOVEREIGNTY means the MP is the servant and not the Master\r\n\r\nRemind them.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The EU Referendum set citizen versus citizen. The EU guaranteed Fundamental Rights. Hillsborough & Stafford show it was left to Citizens to enforce the most basic of Rights - to Life & for Justice. Government & MP's knew but failed - Year after Year. We cannot allowed such rights to be ignored.",
