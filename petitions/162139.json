        "additional_details": "The Child Maintenance Service uses the tax data from HMRC in order to calculate gross income. This also includes any taxable benefits that are not received as cash. They also have a 20% tolerance for any changes in income (up or down).\r\n\r\nThis can mean that a paying parent can be on an income of \u00a350,000 a year, with a company car and company fuel, and any other benefits such as private health etc, could be seen to have a gross income of \u00a360,000 (even though they pay tax on these benefits). Also, due to the tolerance in place, they will not review income changes (even a reduction in income) if it is less than 20% change.\r\n",
        "background": "The child maintenance calculations are unfair to the paying parent, due to the method of calculation. I am asking the relevant Secretary of State to review these calculations and to make them fairer to both the paying and receiving parents. \r\n\r\nThis should also include a cap in maintenance payable.",
