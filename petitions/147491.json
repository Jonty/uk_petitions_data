        "additional_details": "Constitutional law, no withdrawal provision is necessary in any Treaty Our Parliament can pass any Act it likes including an Act to withdraw from any Treaty it has previously signed. Baroness Scotland informed the Lords on January 11th 2000 \"We see no need for the Treaties governing membership of the Union to include a specific provision on unilateral withdrawal. It remains open to Parliament to repeal the European Communities Act 1972, the consequence of which would be to withdraw from the EU.\"",
        "background": "Sovereignty of the United Kingdom, internal and external, remains intact and unimpaired. It is simply not being exercised, because our MPs have, in effect, contracted out much of their work to the EU. We insist that our MPs do all the work we pay them for, no longer sub-contracting it to Brussels. ",
