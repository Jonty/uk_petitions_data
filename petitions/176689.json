        "additional_details": "This leads to physical issues, chronic stress causing untamed behaviour & sadly, even worse.\r\n\r\nThe RSPCA's guideline is 80X50cm floor space as a minimum. There are thousands of cages smaller than this being sold every day as \"permanent\" homes for Syrian Hamsters by uneducated staff.\r\n\r\nCages sold as Large (30x59cm) are too small for permanent residence, the minimum recommended size for an adult Syrian should be 80x50cm. Lets be the voice for those that cant speak & improve the welfare of hamsters.",
        "background": "Thousands of hamsters are kept in cages not suitable. \r\nAccording to a pet shop \"a cage sized 30X59cm is the biggest cage & is suitable to keep a hamster in as they don't grow much.\" Incorrect advice is being given to owners & millions of hamsters are living in cages that are not actually big enough",
