        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom is under threat of being dismantled.\r\nScotland and Northern Ireland may leave the union.\r\nThe economic chaos and cost of leaving would weaken the country for many years.\r\nOnly 38% (52% of a 72% turnout) of the electorate, excluding 16 & 17 year olds, voted to leave the EU.\r\nThey were misled by false promises of public spending.\r\nThe EU referendum is only advisory and is not legally binding. Parliament has full sovereignty and the duty to protect our nation from this awful prospect.",
        "background": "The Union of the United Kingdom itself is threatened.\r\nOnly 38% of the electorate voted to leave the EU.\r\n16 & 17 year olds who will be most affected were not able to vote.\r\nMany who voted to leave are now realising that the promises made on immigration and public spending will not be fulfilled.",
