        "action": "Make sure the UK's EU referendum goes ahead as promised.",
        "additional_details": "The British people must be given the opportunity to have their say on the UK's membership of the EU. The last referendum on Europe was the Common Market referendum in 1975, and a significant proportion of the public wouldn't have been old enough to vote in that referendum. Furthermore, the EU is now significantly different to the Common Market to which we originally signed up. Therefore, the 2016 referendum must go ahead as planned.",
        "background": "There is currently a petition demanding that the EU referendum be cancelled. This is intended to be a counter-petition. This government promised us an in-out EU referendum in their manifesto, and many people would've voted in the general election based on that pledge, so the referendum must go ahead",
