        "additional_details": "Following 13 cycles of chemotherapy Beryl is now undergoing an experimental course of immunotherapy in the form of \"Pembrolizumab\".  Had Beryl been suffering from Melanoma she would have been able to access Pembrolizumab for free on the NHS. Although NICE have licensed Pembrolizumab for Melanoma, it is not licensed for her type of cancer. There are not enough sufferers to support a formal trial. We find the decision not to fund Beryl's, and other rare cancer sufferers', care very unjust. \r\n",
