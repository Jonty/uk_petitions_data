        "additional_details": "The government agreed in principle to accepting around 3,000 refugee children but reneged on the decision without good reason after accepting 350.\r\nThere are thousands of children stranded, alone and vulnerable, having fled the horrors of war in their home country. \r\nTime is running out for them, and the government should reverse their decision immediately.\r\nNot only is the children's safety, and their lives, at stake, but also Britain's reputation as a kind, decent and humane nation.",
        "background": "The Dubs Amendment was recently set up by Lord Dubs, himself a child refugee, in order to help unaccompanied children fleeing their homes.\r\nThe government has prematurely cancelled the amendment, leaving thousands of vulnerable children stranded, despite U.K. councils being ready to accept them.\r\n\r\n",
