        "additional_details": "I run a group on Facebook and everyday there are more missing pets. Dog fighting still exists and in a recent report it has stated dog fighting happened every day. Licenses will require the owner to pass simple knowledge and possibly even annual checks to be sure the pet is safe. This would work well with a register listing all animal abusers so they do not hurt an animal again as they wont have a license to buy pets. In addition stop the ban on the four dogs. With responsible owners these dogs do not need to be banned. ",
        "background": "More and more pets are going missing as well as stolen. As well as this, dog fighting is still in existence. By introducing licenses we can reduce this and know that pets are in a safe home through the checks owners must go through to own any animal.",
