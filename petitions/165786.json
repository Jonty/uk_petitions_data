        "additional_details": "Deobandi Islam is the most common form in UK mosques, growing from colonial India to protect Muslim identity from British influence. It therefore demands not befriending non-muslims, or integrating into British society.\r\nWomen have to cover their faces and not travel a distance of more than 48 miles unless accompanied by a male relative (even if the purpose is to attend a religious gathering).\r\n\r\nhttp://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/06/who-runs-our-mosques/\r\n\r\nThis is not something that should be funded.",
        "background": "Stop all foreign funding of Mosques in the UK.\r\n\r\nSaudi Arabia and Qatar are well-known for funding an ever more regressive, illiberal, and misogynist interpretation of Islam (Deobandi) in the UK.\r\nRemoving this funding will help to reduce home-grown Islamic extremism and cultural enclaves",
