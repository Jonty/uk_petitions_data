        "additional_details": "We now know that former legal highs are available illegally and have become more dangerous. The industry still exists. It is wasting police time and resources when we should be focusing on terror and more important matters. Even the UN says drugs should be decriminalised.\r\n\r\nUK Parliament has made more people into criminals when it is supposed to be criminal justice reform. The Equalities Commission & the PM said coloured people are more likely to go to jail this is racist legislation.",
