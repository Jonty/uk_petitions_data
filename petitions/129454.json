        "additional_details": "I suffer from many hidden illnesses, but my main problem (Fibromyalgia & Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) is not yet recognised as a disability in the UK, yet my symptoms are. I ask for a better understanding from PIP assessors and a system that works for people like me.",
        "background": "Assessors don't understand that I can't correctly fill in their forms as I can't tell you how many days I will become unable to help myself after any given activity. I visit my family at the weekend, and it takes me ALL WEEK to recover, just to do it again. I just want us to be heard and understood.",
