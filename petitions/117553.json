        "additional_details": "We have an inexcusable relationship with Saudi Arabia. We buy her oil, help give her a seat on the Human Rights Council, sell her fighter jets (72 aircrafts in a $6.8bn deal as an example), some of which are currently being used in Yemen \r\nMoreover, given the fact that the Saudi's long campaign to spread their hardline creed of Wahhabism worldwide has since mutated to into a violent anti-heresy creed found in 'Islamic State,' we cannot stand idly by and be complicit in this with our petrodollars\r\n",
        "background": "In light of: a) Saudi Arabia's mass-executions including the Arab Spring leader Shaykh Nimr from an oppressed Shi'i minority b) her supporting extremists in Syria - the progenitors to 'Islamic State'  c) and her illegal war in Yemen...We MUST cease doing business with her until she changes course\r\n",
