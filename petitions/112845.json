Far from an attack on Islam, we are engaged in a defence of Islam, and far from a risk of radicalising British Muslims by acting, failing to act would actually be to betray British Muslims and the wider religion of Islam in its very hour of need.\u201d   \r\n\r\nThe Prime Minister, having carefully considered strong representation made to him by many Members of Parliament across the House, advised the House on 2 December that \u201cI feel that it is time to join our key ally, France, the Arab League, and other members of the international community in using, as frequently as possible, the terminology \u201cDaesh\u201d rather than ISIL. This evil death cult is neither a true representation of Islam nor a state.\u201d\r\n\r\nForeign and Commonwealth Office",
