        "additional_details": "A cycle lane gives a cyclist a little more confidence, especially for newer cyclists.\r\nCycle lanes that have vehicles in them are not only a waste of money and resources, but dangerous to cyclist and moving vehicles. \r\nThe cyclist has to go further into the road in an area where a cycle lane was deemed to be needed.\r\nWhat is the point in having cycle lanes that are unusage by cyclists because they are full of parked cars?",
        "background": "Cycle lanes can help increase confidence for cyclist with a designated part of the road, either by having it separate from roads of with road markings.\r\nWhen vehicles park or wait in a cycle lane, it not only makes the cycle lane pointless, it actually increases the risks to cyclists.",
