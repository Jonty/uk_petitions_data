        "additional_details": "Abellio have continuously increased ticket prices, yet for many, conditions continue to get worse. Many photos of the ageing rolling stock and poor conditions can be found via twitter (https://twitter.com/Delayed_Again/media), as passengers turn to social media to vent their frustrations. In one case, used syringes were discovered on the trains, as were fleas and maggots.\r\n\r\nWe the undersigned have had enough of Abellio, and call on the government to exclude them from the 2016 franchise decision.",
        "background": "Passengers using Abellio Greater Anglia are often having to endure misery on a daily basis due to a seemingly unending torrent of delays and cancellations. They have failed to deliver the previously promised investment. Taken together, Abellio have proven they are not fit to run the franchise.",
