        "additional_details": "The County of Cleveland was created in 1974 and named after the historic region, but not covering it all, and also including land north of the Tees that had until then been in Co Durham. It was situated around the Teesside urban area and included Middlesbrough, Stockton-on-Tees, Hartlepool and Redcar.\r\nThe county was abolished in 1996 with its boroughs becoming unitary authorities and the Tees re-established as the border between North Yorkshire and County Durham for ceremonial purposes only.",
        "background": "The County of Cleveland no longer exists. Middlesbrough gets called North Yorkshire and Hartlepool Durham. The area has no identity, the Police Service is past its prime. Let's move forward & evolve; use the original boundaries of Durham and North Yorkshire as our Policing areas for 2020 & beyond.",
