        "additional_details": "The intention is to fix Boxing Day to the 26th Dec regardless of what day it falls on so that it is observed formally as a national holiday.\r\n\r\nThis would mean that if Boxing Day falls on a Saturday or a Sunday, that day is observed as Boxing Day and (Sunday) the Day of Rest is observed on the Monday instead.\r\n\r\nThis Petition is about recognising the priorities and people and how times have changed. Boxing Day would be given priority over business and Sunday day of rest.",
        "background": "If 26 Dec is on a Sun, Boxing Day in the UK is moved to 27 Dec. In the UK, Boxing Day is a bank holiday. If Boxing Day is on a Sat, the following Mon is a substitute bank holiday. On occasion when Xmas Day is on a Sat, the following Mon is Boxing Day and Tue a substitute bank holiday for Xmas. ",
