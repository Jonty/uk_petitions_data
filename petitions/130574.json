        "additional_details": "A recent documentary by the BBC called 'Britain's Puppy Dealers: exposed' illustrated real examples of dog dealers and how dogs and puppies are left in small cages without heat, food or any air holes, and how small puppies were dumped on the side of the road because they were either dead or not up to standard. This type of evidence illustrates why this needs to be stopped. ",
        "background": "Recently seen visual images regarding how dogs are held captive and bread in small cages in order to be sold on the high street. Dogs should not be sold or treated this way. I want action because animal cruelty should not be acceptable in any circumstances. ",
