        "additional_details": "I'm currently serving in the British Army attached to the Navy, as I bought my own home I have to commute every weekend. Within the navy married personnel who own and live in a house do not require to pay for camp accommodation. But Army policy you have to pay for accommodation until you are 37 which I believe is unfair.  As the reason why serving members need the accommodation is to allow them a place to sleep and administrate whilst away from their personal home.",
