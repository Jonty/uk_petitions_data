        "additional_details": "I have decided to try to take action based on the recent call to the Police about a gull stealing a sandwich ( is that really true?) and someone calling 999 because they didn't have any toilet paper. Whether these stories are true or not, it reflects the lack of respect for our over stretched emergency services when they could be deployed in a true life or death emergency",
        "background": " I'm a senior nurse, I've worked for HM Coastguard, and I am also part of the fund raising committee for the RNLI. I feel very strongly that our resources are valuable and should not be abused, thus potentially leaving the door open for disaster when dealing with non emergency calls to the 999 line",
