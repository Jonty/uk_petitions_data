        "additional_details": "Leaders of the Brexit campaign are backtracking on pre-referendum promises/claims e.g. \u00a3530 million per week will not be going into the NHS, we will still have free movement of the workforce in the EU, and we will still be paying into the EU to be part of the free market.\r\n\r\nIt is apparent that many people who voted Brexit did so as a protest vote against austerity.\r\n\r\nEvidence for above is freely available in the press.",
        "background": "Voters were provided with misinformation and made it difficult to make an informed decision. Much of the Remain campaign claims are transpiring. The Brexit side appear to have based their case on misinformation on emotive issues such as controlling immigration and significant investment in the NHS.",

The expression \"vote of no confidence\" is used when talking about a vote in the House of Commons which tests whether or not the Government of the day has the confidence of a majority of MPs in the House of Commons. That's why we allow petitions asking for a vote of no confidence in the Government or in individual Ministers. \r\n\r\nThe concept of the House having \u201cconfidence\u201d in someone does not apply to the referendum result."
