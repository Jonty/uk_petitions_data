        "action": "Amend the Care Act (s73) 2014 which fails to protect private paying patients",
        "additional_details": "No tests were offered to ascertain if the device was displaced as I had this surgical procedure privately. I had to vigorously research what tests were needed to identify misplacement and I eventually learnt that a volume and gadolinium MRI would be the only source. These tests were eventually done after much persistence that finally illustrated incorrect placement that has caused me physical injuries and lost career. Members of the public are under the assumption that private paying patients will always be protected but the Care Act 2014 has never protected this category of patients; this Act needs amending to ensure  all of the public are protected irrespective of fee source.      \r\n\r\n ",
        "background": "I was booked for elective day surgery in a Private Hospital but unfortunately, the device was placed incorrectly that has resulted in horrendous physical injuries. The Private Hospital is not liable and the Surgeon denied misplacement that was not discovered until years later. \r\n ",
