        "additional_details": "Recently, France introduced a law that bans supermarkets from throwing away unsold food \u2013 forcing them to donate it to charities and food banks or face a fine.  As the biggest EU waster of food, the UK needs this law too. The government is hesitant because they currently make approx \u00a3500 million in Landfill Taxes.  We must put pressure on the government to introduce legislation which ensures that precious food is shared, and not wasted.  This way everyone benefits, including the environment.",
        "background": "A 2014 inquiry found that the UK wastes 14 million tonnes of food a year, twice the EU average and the biggest waster. And the latest data available shows that food waste is costing the UK \u00a32.94 billion. The decomposition of food waste in landfills is also polluting the environment with methane.",
