        "action": "Screening and training for mobility scooters especially for class 3",
        "additional_details": "Training is needed for cars and motorcycles that use the highways but no training is needed for mobility scooters. AM Hefin David and AM Julie Morgan are in agreement that training should be given. Compulsory training will help reduce accident rates and make the users more confident and independent which will help with well-being. Statistics are being looked into to make insurance mandatory but not training. ROSPA say training should be given but not necessary!\r\n\r\nScreening should also be done by a doctor or medical professional before buying a mobility scooter. This will ensure that people have the physical and mental capacity required to safely use a scooter, such as adequate vision.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "There are 300,000 mobility users in England and Wales. There were 208 accidents in 2014-2015, 46 serious injuries, and 9 deaths. Class 3 mobility scooters can use the road up to 8mph, need TAX and at present, only voluntary insurance.",
