        "additional_details": "In June Patrick McLoughlin announced  that  a \u00a31.1billion scheme to electrify the line had been \u201cpaused\u201d.   \r\n\r\nBut a previously approved \u00a3200m towards Midland Main Line improvements must now be made. It will better travel times from Nottingham to London by 13 minutes.\r\nSo today The Nottingham Post has teamed up with Nottinghamshire County Council to launch a Fast Track to Notts campaign demanding   the Main Line is improved. \r\n\r\nIt will also bring huge economic benefits to the East Midlands.",
