        "additional_details": "Throughout my travels I have find that very few pubs and bars as well as establishments generally have good access for disabled people. The vast majority will often have steps that a disabled person cannot overcome without some form of assistance.\r\n\r\nThus the law should be changed meaning that all pubs and bars must have step free access, in a similar manner to them being 'smoke free'. That would greatly improve the opportunities available to disabled people. ",
