        "additional_details": "We should ensure every citizen gets, at a bare minimum, the necessities of food, shelter and water. This includes people who miss meetings at the job centre, get fired from their job, are under or over a certain age, or are children of single parents with many siblings. Everybody deserves to live, but recent changes to our benefits system seem to forget this and force people to rely upon charities. The government should provide these necessities, to anybody who needs supporting, at all times.",
        "background": "We would never make a prisoner go without food, shelter or water. We do however remove benefits from people who cannot provide for themselves. Charities should not be used as the safety net - the government should be providing.",
