        "additional_details": "It is widely viewed amongst society that fathers are heavily penalised in child contact cases, and that all support is heavily biased towards mothers. \r\n\r\nMany fathers are wrongfully accused and a scan of mothers forums show evidence of collaboration in what accusations to make to prevent/limit contact. CAFCASS are complicit in these activities and their case workers highly prejudiced. Mothers are not held accountable for falsifying accusations.",
        "background": "A request that a Parliamentary commitee be set up to review the way family courts are conducted, the basis of evidence that they and cafcass depend on to make decisions, and the way family courts and CAFCASS are biased towards the mothers wishes over the fathers, more importantly the childs needs.",
