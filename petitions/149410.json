        "action": "Simplify the process of getting British citizenship for resident EU citizens",
        "additional_details": "EU citizens have built carriers, started businesses, payed taxes, contributed to the community and most importantly the UK had become their home.\r\nThe UK leaving the EU makes these EU citizens feel second class citizens in their home. They feel unwanted, discriminated and they are left in uncertainty. \r\nThe current process for them to become British citizens is complicated and expensive. UK Government must protect the rights of these EU citizens and simplify the process of their naturalisation.",
        "background": "EU citizens resident in the UK for at least 5 years have to be offered a simple process to gain British citizenship to ensure they have the right to remain, live and work in the UK indefinitely and irretrievably.\r\nThe current process is complicated and many families can not afford it.",
