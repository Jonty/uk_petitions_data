        "additional_details": "Siblings of children with disabilities face more difficulties than their counterparts and quite often need the peer interaction more than the disabled child themselves. Without them being able to access the FEET funding, their parents are left with very little option to give them socialisation and respite from the demands of a household with a special needs child. Disabled children & their siblings need to be supported equally, socialisation and respite are large parts of this. ",
        "background": "FEET funding allows 2 year olds in certain categories to access pre-school places. Currently this is for children from low income families, looked after children & disabled children. There is no provision for siblings of disabled children who also need these spaces. ",
