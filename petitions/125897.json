        "additional_details": "When a call is made to OPODO, customers are often asked to wait several minutes in some cases hours and could be hung up on. This way one has to start a call afresh only to be delayed online for several minutes and eventually sent to a different correspondent who will waste more time asking same details you had already provided the previous correspondent. This practice is a routine delay tactic to discourage customers. In one instance a customer phone bill was ~\u00a3200 just calling OPODO for help",
        "background": "The number of complaints against the travel agent OPODO.co.uk is on the rise. This company has become the worst nightmare for travelers especially in the event of a flight cancellation, booking changes or when seeking clarification about flight bookings. Claiming refunds is a nightmare and they lie.",
