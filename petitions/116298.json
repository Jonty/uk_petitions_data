        "additional_details": "After Gastric Bypass surgery 15% of all patients will suffer with severe complications for the rest of their lives, some, resulting in death. Our stomachs are our survival tool for obtaining nutrients to keep us alive. Without it, our other organs begin to lose out on these nutrients and no amount of weight loss will make up for the internal damage our bodies suffer due to malabsorption. The benefits can never outweigh the risks of this operation and the list of complications are endless. ",
        "background": "At present the solution for the ever growing obesity issues in the UK seems to be the popular Gastric Bypass. On the 15th June 2014 my mother lost her life due to the many complications she suffered after undergoing bypass surgery in 2011. An operation which is so dangerous should not be allowed.",
