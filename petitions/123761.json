        "action": "Ban loud vehicle exhaust modification",
        "additional_details": "I live and work in central Elgin and have to listen to the same cars tearing round and round the town centre over and over again day and night. Ban this pointless modification culture now, as I'm sure it will only get worse. It is unfair and there is no need for them to be doing this. It is anti-social behaviour and a nuisance.",
        "background": "Ban people modifying their cars and bikes to have louder exhausts than the ones they come with. There is no reason what so ever for these people to have loud exhausts apart from misguided vanity, yet the general public have to put up with their right to peace and quiet being removed by a few idiots.",
