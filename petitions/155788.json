        "action": "Allow 16 - 18-Year-olds the opportunity to vote in their own EU referendum.",
        "additional_details": "Giving our teenagers this will encourage them that democracy works.  Seeing as the MPs still have to vote whether to implement article 50 and they take it in their hands to do so either way I see no issue in this practice if it could be for the greater good. Ultimately we can add their votes to the main body of the votes received for a final collection and put this decision to rest.",
        "background": "Allow our 16-18's that are interested in having their say concerning the EU referendum do so to truly represent the UK. Knowing Scotland gave their teenagers the ability to vote in the independence referendum in 2014 we must give the UK that same opportunity.",
