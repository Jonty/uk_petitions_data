        "additional_details": "Nursery Assistants and early years educators perform a similar job to that of a reception class teacher. We must ensure children are learning and developing at a rate deemed age appropriate. We must carry out rergular assessments on the children, and facilitate learning environments and activities based on each individual childs needs. We need to have in depth knowledge of the Early Years Foundation Stage and are usually required to be qualified.",
        "background": "Nursery assistants and early years educators follow the same EYFS targets as a reception class teacher. We are now required to have specified knowledge of children's learning and development. It is no longer 'just' childcare. We are teachers.",
