        "additional_details": "Several statements made by leaders of the Exit campaign are now being withdrawn after the referendum result, therfore there is a real risk that a significant proportion of the population has been misled. This undermines democracy and has enormous consequences if acted up too hastily.\r\n\r\nA General Election is necessary in order for the public to select between parties that have pro, and against, EU membership as described in their respective manifestos.",
        "background": "The referendum has demonstrated that the country is split roughly 50/50 on EU membership.The failure of a strong majority is insufficient to enact such a fundamental change in our relationship with Europe. An election before Article 50 is enacted is required to offer all a a chance for reflection.\r\n",
