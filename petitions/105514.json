        "additional_details": "Currently the HP company along with the dealership are putting a case stating the sale of a used car \"can exceed the manufacturer's recommendations and this would not render the vechile of unsatisfactory quality.\" What is a grey area is how long this can be exceeded before deemed unfit for purpose and unsatisfactory in accordance to existing legislation.\r\n\r\nI propose a law where manufacturer guidelines are honoured or a set time frame for repair is done before purchase of a used car to the public.",
        "background": " I bought a car from a dealership whereby two months before purchase an urgent note left by the manufacturer service centre stating a cambelt had exceeded it's lifespan, of which wasn't replaced. A law must safeguard guidelines and consumers from dealerships breaching manufacturer  recommendations.",
