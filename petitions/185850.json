        "additional_details": "According to the BBC \"Vitamin D deficiency is likely to affect over half the UK's white population, up to 90% of the multi-ethnic population and a quarter of all children living in Britain.\"\r\n\r\nThe British Medical Journal recently published a journal saying fortifying foods with Vitamin D (adding Vitamin D to food) would reduce the risk of illness and improve bone and muscle health.\r\n\r\nThe SACN has also urged an increase in the RDA of Vitamin D to 10 \u00b5g/day (400 IU/d), throughout the year.",
        "background": "Finding tasty foods that are high in Vitamin D is a challenging task.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the UK population suffers from Vitamin D deficiencies. \r\nGovernment must act to prevent the continuing rise in bone diseases such as rickets through mandatory Vitamin D food fortification, as in USA and Canada.",
