        "background": "On 23/06/16 the People of Scotland gave voice to their Sovereign Will and chose for the UK to Remain a member of the EU.\r\n\r\nThe only legitimate course of action is for the Government to withdraw Leave voting regions and Nations from the EU in the same manner as Denmark withdrew Greenland.\r\n",
