        "action": "Overturn the decision to allow Fracking in Lancashire permanently.",
        "additional_details": "Fracking uses a technique of breaking up rock to release natural gas, and there are serious environmental and public health concerns, including chemical exposure, toxic drinking water, nosebleeds, and headaches.\r\n\r\nBut around the world opposition against fracking is bubbling and it's working. Victoria has recently become the first Australian state to ban fracking outright, joining France, Ireland, and the U.S. states of New York and Maryland.",
        "background": "Cuadrilla has been given the green light to frack Lancashire, even though the County Council said NO!\r\nFracking could begin as early as next year. \r\nThis is a major step up in fracking in the UK: four wells have been approved compared to the single one in North Yorkshire earlier this year.",
