Furthermore every main political point that people thought they were voting for has been overturned in the light of the result. Which means it was a false vote.",
        "background": "The vote carried out this week was not fully understood by many of those who voted. It became a protest vote for those in deprived areas who felt they were being ignored by politicians.\r\nThe vote was not binding and we can avoid the chaos this will create.",
