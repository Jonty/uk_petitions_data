        "additional_details": "On June 23rd 2016 the British public were asked to vote on whether Britain should remain in the EU. Since the referendum result, it has transpired that there was never a firm leave plan put in place in the event of Brexit. With the benefit of hindsight, I believe that in the interest of both sides (in and out) a 2nd referendum should take place once a full plan has been discussed by our Government with the EU and then revealed to the British public so they can make a better informed decision. ",
        "background": "I believe a mistake was made in giving the British people a choice to vote on whether we should remain a part of the EU due to the fact that no plan or procedure was ever put in place for Brexit resulting in minimal information given to either side in order for a sensible, informed vote to be made.",
