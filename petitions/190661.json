        "additional_details": "Look through history and you'll find that there have been no recorded deaths due to marijuana. Not a single one. There have been cases of deaths where marijuana was in the system of the deceased, but in these cases, a plethora of other drugs and alcohol was also found.\r\n\r\nAlcohol and tobacco kill millions every year the world over, and it makes no sense to keep cannabis illegal while these are allowed.\r\n\r\nIf you're old enough to drink, vote, drive, and serve, you're old enough to smoke a plant.",
        "background": "With scientific studies pouring in seemingly every week about the benefits of using marijuana in certain situations, it is absurd that this natural substance is still illegal in this country. Allowing anyone over the age of 18 to grow two plants without fear of prosecution is reasonable, and fair.",
