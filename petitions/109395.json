        "action": "Halt the ultra-polluting London City Cruise Terminal before it costs lives",
        "additional_details": "No fewer than 117 local groups and individuals lodged written objections, more than 400 signed a petition, and only three letters were sent in favour. But the Royal Borough of Greenwich approved the scheme, dismissing pollution fears, as did the Mayor of London. Now, however, the Mayor agrees \"the colossal diesel engines\" will indeed emit dangerous pollutants, but he says he backed the terminal because locals want it. We don't \u2013 and we urge the Secretary of State to step in before it's too late.",
        "background": "A proposed cruise terminal at Greenwich will be a major pollution hazard because hotelling ships take their power from dirty diesel engines. The vessels could connect to cleaner onshore power but the developer refuses, saying it's too expensive, so local people will have to breathe lethal emissions.",
