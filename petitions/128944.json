        "additional_details": "The NHS is being systematically denied the resources it needs to deliver care in rural areas and a full Parliamentary board of Inquiry needs to be established to assess the funding necessary for providing vital services.  Community Hospitals have closed leading to pressure on the District Hospital that is now threatened with being downgraded because of lack of appropriate funding for the NHS.  The level of funding needs to be established but it also needs to be delivered.",
        "background": "Community Hospital beds have been closed across the area and now the Success Regime is consulting on closing all acute services at North Devon District Hospital.  This would leave residents in North Devon and Torridge over 90 minutes away from the nearest A&E. ",
