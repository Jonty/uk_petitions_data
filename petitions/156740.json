        "additional_details": "Sitting in an exam is hard as it is, but sitting one in a car with an examiner next to guy watching at everything you do is another thing. I think the driving test time should be reduced to at least 20-30 minutes. \r\n\r\nMany people fail their test because their nervous and don't know what the examiner is writing, it puts the learner under a lot of stress and end up failing their tests. \u00a362 is a lot of money to spend every time you fail and have to rebook a test. Reducing the time will be good.",
        "background": "40 minutes for a driving test is a long time to sit in a car with an examiner looking at you throughout the test. Many people fail their test not because their bad drivers but because their nervous and sweaty. ",
