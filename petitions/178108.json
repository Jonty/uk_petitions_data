        "additional_details": "The two child policy will see many families, including working families, thrown into poverty and unable to house or feed their children if the two child policy is allowed to go ahead.\r\n\r\nThis is unjust when a system is supposed to be there as a safety net to prevent poverty, not be the cause of it! Children should not be punished because they happened to be born into a family with more than two children.\r\n",
        "background": "From April 2017 all new claims for child tax credits or universal credit will be limited to two children only. Current claimants will also not be able to claim for a third or subsequent children from this date.\r\n\r\nIn addition from November 2018 ALL claimants will only be allowed to claim for 2 kids.",
