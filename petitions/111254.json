        "action": "investigate adoption cases correctly and stop forced adoption",
        "additional_details": "i believe these changes should be made as myself and my partner have been victims of forced adoption our youngest son we have together was very well loved and looked after, he wanted for nothing but that wasn't enough for our local social services and they took him from us and had him adopted without our consent. It effected me and partner massively, after doing research on forced adoption and seeing how much it is happening and i strongly feel somebody somewhere should look into this.",
        "background": "I think social services should have some one with more power than them to answer to and if a parent believes their child is being wrongly adopted they should be able to go to a person in power and put their point across and have the case reassessed by an independent individual.",
