This means that it will assess the planning application against certain criteria and decide if a full inquiry is needed. For more information, including the criteria and how to request the call in of a planning application, see: \r\n  \r\nhttp://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/SN00930/SN00930.pdf \r\n  \r\nYou could also contact your local MP, who may wish to request the decision is called in if they agree with you.
