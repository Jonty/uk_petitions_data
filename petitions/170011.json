        "additional_details": "After recently purchasing tiskets to see Phil Collins I saw that many fans were upset to see a lack of tickets but the secondry market was full of them.\r\n\r\nOn many occasions these were priced at 4 or more times the face value. On this occasion tickets with a face valye of \u00a385 were on sale of upwards of \u00a3250.\r\n\r\nTouts are cashing is & preventing true fans access to events.\r\n\r\nI feel that this now has to be regulated & all tickets should be not allowed to be sold for more that 10% of Face value! ",
        "background": "I like many true fans get frustrated when trying to get tickets to big events. Only to find that they are sold out on most occasion even before General sale dates.\r\n\r\nThen within hours the tickets are for sale on secondry sale markets such as Stubhub for multiple times the face value.",
