        "additional_details": "This petition does not seek to overturn the recent referendum result or request a second referendum.  It simply seeks to ensure that any Brexit deal guarantees the residency and employment rights of EU nationals living in Britain and Britons living in other EU countries which are not currently guaranteed. This has left many individuals and their families uncertain of their futures.",
        "background": "Following the EU referendum, the futures of EU nationals living in the UK and UK nationals living in EU countries are completely unknown. We demand that they are allowed to remain in the country of their choice.",
