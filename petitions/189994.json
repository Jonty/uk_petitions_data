        "action": "Need more consumer protection for airline & travel bookings.",
        "additional_details": "The vast majority of the airline tickets are 100% non refundable which means the consumer has no recourse to change their mind. Given that most people book several months in advance, there is a high likelyhood of changes to travel plans. The current system is so heavily against the consumer & is is inherently unfair. Why should airlines and travel companies enjoy such unprecented priveleges? I call upon the government to legistate for better rights to consumers in this regard.",
        "background": "People spend thousands of pounds buying air tickets & making travel bookings. Strangely there is no consumer protection whatsoever. There must a period of atleast 14 days when the consumer has the ability to cancel their purchase and get a full refund in line with distance selling regulations. ",
