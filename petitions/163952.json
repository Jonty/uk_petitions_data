        "additional_details": "If implemented the result of the June 2016 EU Referendum means the United Kingdom would leave the World\u2019s most influential network of nations on the base of a remarkably thin majority for such a huge step.\r\nThis is the decision of a lifetime to ALL British Citizens, wherever they live, yet the outcome was based on an undemocratic principle.\r\nThe millions of British citizens residing outside the UK are not only grass-roots ambassadors of the UK spread all over the planet but are affected by the result of the EU Referendum just as much as, if not more so, than UK residents.\r\nHowever, millions of expats resident outside the UK for more than 15 years were not eligible to vote and were in effect disenfranchised. Therefore the result is not democratically legitimate.\r\n",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to implement a rule to trigger an additional EU Referendum for all expatriate British Citizens, regardless of the length of time they have resided outside the United Kingdom.",
