I believe there should be a mechanism that would make it easier to achieve peace than to achieve war, easier to facilitate peace in Northern Ireland than to start a war in Iraq. Following the appointment of Fabian Hamilton to the position of Shadow Minister for Peace and Disarmament \u2013 a post created in 2016 by Labour Leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 it is my proposal that from now on all UK governments must include the senior cabinet positions of Ministers for Peace and Disarmament.",
