        "action": "Make the triggering of Article 50 subject to a free parliamentary vote.",
        "additional_details": "Article 50 requires that the process is triggered prior to negotiation with the EU, and that triggering then commits to exit on terms yet to be agreed. The UK Government desire to withold the negotiating position prior to trigger is therefore understandable. However we believe that parliament has a superior duty to decide whether or not to trigger Article 50 on the basis of (a) a specific, detailed UK 'Brexit' proposal; and (b) the likely range of terms of a final agreement with the EU.",
        "background": "We believe that the triggering of Article 50 should be determined by a free vote in the House of Commons. The referendum should be treated as advisory to avoid usurping the sovereignty of parliament. Moreover we believe that the Article 50 vote should reference specific UK-proposed 'Brexit' terms.",
