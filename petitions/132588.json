Most of the cyclists on the roads don't care about cars, and get stupidly close to cars. Ride ridiculously and go through red lights and it needs to come to a stop. If one day a motorist hits someones car. We would have to automatically pay due to them NOT having insurance now for new drivers this could be \u00a31000 extra on insurance.",
