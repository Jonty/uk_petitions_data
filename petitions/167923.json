I want to potentially get the law changed for children born in the UK as it isn't right that because my parents were not born in the UK and my father lost one document from when he was a child I can not get my passport. When my father was a child you could claim through grandparents so it wouldn't matter but since the law has changed it was made it increasing hard to get a passport.",
