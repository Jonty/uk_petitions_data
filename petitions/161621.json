        "additional_details": "The decision not to appoint a Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change has been widely criticised by groups such as Friends of The Earth and Greenpeace, politicians and experts. The implication is that the UK commitment to acting on climate change has been downgraded and that there is no specific voice for climate change action in cabinet.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change-department-killed-off-by-theresa-may-in-plain-stupid-and-deeply-worrying-move-a7137166.html",
        "background": "In July Theresa May failed to appoint a Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, merging this role into one for \"Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy\".\r\n\r\nThis undermines the UK's effort to tackle climate change and places a priority on the needs of business ahead of the environment.",
