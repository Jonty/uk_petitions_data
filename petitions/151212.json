        "action": "UK Parliament to veto a Brexit from the EU",
        "additional_details": "1) A Brexit would not be in the best economic, security and cultural interest of the British people.\r\n2) The 'Leave' campaign misled and manipulated the electorate by lying and promising things they never intended.\r\n3) There was not a sufficient enough majority to conclude that the result was decisive and legitimate.\r\n4) There was never a strategy for a Brexit which means the government has knowingly jeopardised the stability of the nation.\r\n5) The Union (UK) is at risk of being torn apart.\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The UK parliament should prevent a Brexit from the EU by refuting the legitimacy of the referendum result and refusing to issue Article 50.\r\n\r\nThis motion will be executed in the best interest of the nation. We believe that the result of the referendum is not enforceable for the following reasons.\r\n",
