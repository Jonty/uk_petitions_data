        "action": "Review event licensing to put a stop to the decline in live music",
        "additional_details": "Particularly in London, more events are being cancelled on the grounds of licence. This causes a surge in overcrowded and unlicenced events, not only continuing a cultural decline in the UK, but making safety an issue. This also leads to many groups being discriminated against due to musical taste, as licensing seems to be genre based.\r\n\r\nI request the police and local councils reconsider licensing policies. They not only hurt us creatively, but recent events have shown that something must change.",
        "background": "Gradually over the past 5 years, event licensing has become more restrictive, making it harder for small promoters to hold events, leading to many attempting unlicensed events as well as events becoming larger due to costs and a lack of options. Both of these consequences put public safety at risk.",
