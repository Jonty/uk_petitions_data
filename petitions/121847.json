New home buyers need more protection - the 10 year warranty is not sufficient to protect against poor quality. If the home buyer can retain 5% of the purchase price, then if the home builder cannot deliver the home to the required cosmetic and structural quality (which can be independently verified), then the home buyer should be allowed to keep the retained capital.",

An incentive must be provided for the house builder to complete the house to the required quality standards.",
