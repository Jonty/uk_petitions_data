        "additional_details": "The rate of 30% is to be paid from profits of said company and will be estimated by the government and checked with the companies own accounts and billed to the off shore company. (Much like when the HMRC decides how much tax a UK citizen should have paid if there is any discrepancy in end of year  accounts.)  If the company disagrees then they will be served a notice to close all remaining branches and leave the country.   ",

So we are calling for OUR government, people that we have put in place to work for US, we the people to charge these companies a UK operating tax of 30%",
