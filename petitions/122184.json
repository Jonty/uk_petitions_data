        "action": "Suspend benefit claimant assessments until a public inquiry is undertaken.",
        "additional_details": "Whilst helping claimants back into work is commendable, the implementation has serious failings :\r\n\r\n1. Thousands assessed as fit for work died within 6 weeks\r\n2. The report on these deaths was inappropriately held back\r\n3. The assessment process is overly demanding, intrusive and inflexibly handled, often aggravating mental health issues of claimants\r\n4. There are claims of flawed recording of assessments\r\n5. The assessors are inappropriately given sanctions targets\r\n6. The costs far exceed advantages",
        "background": "The assessment ideology and implementation has serious failings whose accumulated effect mandates an inquiry, and should be suspended until inquiry recommendations are put in place.",
