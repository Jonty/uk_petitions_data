        "additional_details": "The British population has been betrayed into voting for an outcome that is not in its best interest. The immediate effects of voting leave, while widely predicted, were hushed up and discredited by leave campaigners. Even claims which were shown to be false, such as the \u00a3350m sent weekly to the EU and the implication it could be spent on the NHS, continued to form a major part of the campaign after being discredited. Propagating mistruths should be illegal; a referendum rerun is necessary. ",
        "background": "The lead up to the EU referendum has been marred by lies and mistruths. Experts have been discredited and misinformation has been rife. The British public has been deceived, voting on promises which can now be seen to be false. In light of the deception we call for an emergency referendum rerun. ",
