        "action": "Use UK influence to pressure USA Federal Government to increase gun control.",
        "additional_details": "The UK has a near total ban on firearms in private ownership. Attacks like those seen on USA college campus and in public spaces do not happen here. Illegally held weapons will always be a problem, but by removing the largest mass of weapons from the public domain it removes the possibility of someone carrying out such atrocities. \r\nThe USA constitutional right to bear arms was probably meant to mean that the citizenship could always stand against government not that everyone should have a gun.",
        "background": "The USA continues to suffer mass shootings by persons using legally bought and held guns. Many of these weapons are high powered, high calibre semi or fully automatic. An easily accessible weapon can easily fall into the wrong hands. There is little evidence of citizens using legal guns to protect.",
