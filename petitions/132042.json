        "additional_details": "-A constitutional amendment by initiative not only requires a majority public vote but a majority of cantons must also approve it\r\n-Differs from the mandatory referendum, which is called by parliament and does not need public signatures.\r\nI think that if a petition gets 500,000 signatures over a 6 month period (rather than 18 in Switzerland) then it should be put to the public to decide the outcome. If the petition in question can be resolved by referendum or if the petition is calling for one.",
