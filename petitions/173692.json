        "additional_details": "An RSPCA Officer spoke to my Animal Management class and we discussed the maximum prison sentence for animal cruelty. It doesn't matter how severe the abuse is or how many animals the person has abused the longest sentence is six months. This is immoral. If a person chooses to keep a pet they should provide the care that is needed for that animal. They chose the animal, the animal did not choose them. So why should it be the animal that suffers? Make the sentence longer than six months!",
        "background": "The maximum amount of time in prison for an animal abuser is six months (three months with good behaviour), I feel this is not long enough as it is proven animals can feel pain. We need to join together to speak up for animal rights because they cannot. Six months is not a long enough time.",
