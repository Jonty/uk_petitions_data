        "action": "We DEMAND a second referendum on the issue of the UK leaving the EU.",
        "additional_details": "It is becoming clear that the UK might well have made a great collective error. The value of the pound is dropping, industry is unsure, banks are considering leaving London, hate crime rates have skyrocketed, and the UK is rapidly losing any advantage it has at the negotiating table as other nations (such as Canada) work with the EU on trade deals as the UK faces exclusion from the debates. The nation currently does not even know the direction we are heading post-Brexit. 'Regrexit' is real.",
        "background": "As we approach the end of October 2016 the fog is lifting and it is becoming clearer what the ramifications of the UK exiting the EU are. The electorate MUST be given a second vote on the issue to ensure it is the correct course of action before it is too late to change course.",
