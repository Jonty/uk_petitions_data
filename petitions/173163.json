        "additional_details": " 'Stay Drive Stay Alive' found that young drivers are much more likely to be involved in a crash on the roads, often due to inexperience and a lack of knowledge of the risks. \r\n*Around 1 in 4 deaths on the road is aged 17-24*\r\nThe Safe Drive Stay Alive campaign will reach new and pre-drivers in an emotive and hard-hitting way, influencing behaviour and attitude on the roads. ",
        "background": "This event is used as means of reducing the amount of accidents and road collisions. It is vital that people are aware of the minor things that can significantly impact their lives, and the lives of others. I believe it should be made mandatory before a person can officially gain their licence. ",
