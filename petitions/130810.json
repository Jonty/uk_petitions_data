        "additional_details": "In England, a junior doctor's career is controlled by a public body called Health Education England (HEE).  HEE controls long term employment, and can make decisions to remove a doctor from training.  At this moment in time, if a doctor fears they are being punished for whistleblowing, the decisions of HEE cannot be held to account in an employment tribunal.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.54000doctors.org/thecase/1-intro-and-how-this-case-affects-you.html\r\n",
        "background": "Junior doctors who raise concerns about patient safety do not have full protection under the law, and could lose their career.  We ask that junior doctors have full whistleblowing legal protection, in the same manner as student nurses",
