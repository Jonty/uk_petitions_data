        "action": "Create a virtual parliamentary constituency for serving armed forces personnel.",
        "additional_details": "The creation of a virtual constituency will give serving members of the Armed Forces and their families the opportunity to vote for a person who will directly represent them in Parliament, regardless of where they are based. Critically it will allow the incumbent MP, regardless of party, to immerse him/herself in the specific needs of serving personnel and their families. This role is to be independent of the MoD and the Minister of State for the Armed Forces which reflect Government needs.",
        "background": "The choice of voting for the constituency a Serving Member (and his/her family) find themselves in (when based in the UK) or voting for a constituency they had lived in previously is often unsatisfactory.  In my experience serving members don't vote at all and few use their MP.  \r\n\r\n\r\n",
