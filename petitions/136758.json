        "additional_details": "The result of the EU Referendum on 23 June 2016 was a small majority of 52-48 for the 'Leave' camp, on a turnout of only 72.2%.\r\nConsidering the slim majority, and that this was only an advisory referendum, there is no clear mandate for the UK to leave the EU, and the issue should now be debated by parliament. The lawmakers for the UK are the members of both of the Houses of Parliament, not the general public nor the PM, and the will of the people can only be served by a parliamentary decision.",
        "background": "There is no legal requirement for the Prime Minister to take action on the EU Referendum, but he could make a unilateral decision to start Article 50 procedures.\r\nIn the interests of democracy, the parliament of the UK should have the final responsibility to debate and vote whether to leave the EU.
