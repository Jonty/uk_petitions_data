        "additional_details": "Both local councils and shelter England advice the tenant to stay after the end of the section 21 date. Why should the tenant be liable for cost when following the councils guidance? Why should landlords have to take tenants to court to get their properties back.? Why are councils using a form of blackmail to get tenants to do what they want?",
        "background": "Local housing authorities are forcing private tenants to stay after the end date of a section 21, and making them wait until bailiff evictions. The tenant is responsible for the court and bailiff costs.\r\nIf the tenant does not stay, they are deemed intentionally homeless and refused help.",
