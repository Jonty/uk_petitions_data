        "additional_details": "Too many of the homeless are ex-military and find there is insufficient help for them to find a home after finishing military service. Without a permanent address it is almost impossible  to gain employment .Often they end up sleeping on the streets and alcoholism is a real threat as their life descends into a feeling of hopelessness and despair. Will you sign this petition to ask our Government to ensure there is adequate help for them before they finish their military service .",
        "background": "Quite a lot of the people who are homeless are ex-military who have found it impossible to find accommodation and cannot get on a housing list due to having no postal address.",
