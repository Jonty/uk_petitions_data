        "additional_details": "Staffing levels are to be reduced by 40% which will result in a 50% decrease in ambulance and rapid response vehicle cover. The area covered by this station includes the Holme, Colne, Dearne Valleys and the Huddersfield area.  The planned reduction to 1 ambulance crew 24/7 will mean this area will be without emergency cover for long periods of time. Statistics show that a high % of life threatening time critical emergency calls are already not achieved due to a lack of available resources. ",

We believe this will have serious implications for the public.The plans will leave the area devoid of cover for long periods of time.We are asking for your support to protect the service that we provide for the local communities.",
