        "additional_details": "Our band Solid Rock from Whalley, Lancashire, professionally recorded our own songs at The Grand Studio, Clitheroe. These are now exported to over 36 countries. We receive little reward on our  investment though. US companies take 98% of streaming revenue. With Brexit forcing new UK trade deals with the USA, an opportunity will arise to sort a more equitable bargain. MP's must ensure that the present blatantly unfair situation is reversed to a 50/50 deal to secure a future for UK songwriters.   ",
        "background": "The UK music industry is a great exporter. Present streaming revenues though are paltry, unfair and discouraging talent. In the free trade deal yet to be negotiated, Parliament needs to ensure a better deal for all musicians. We need their technology.They need our music. So 50/50 is the fair deal ! ",
