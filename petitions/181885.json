        "action": "Stop the endless war raged upon motorist's with average speed checks on UK roads",
        "additional_details": "Since when did it become that everyone in the UK cannot be entrusted with the use of speed and driving a car? The example of Germany with motorways without speed limit and low accident rates. People are responsible and do not want to risk their live's. Looking where you are going is far safer, not at your speedometer constantly. The car is one of the UK's biggest and most popular pastimes. It is sacrilege the way the motorist is being treated. A total review must be taken and sanctions repealed.",
        "background": "The motorist is constantly faced with sanctions. It feels like a one sided argument that the minute you get behind the wheel, you feel like a criminal. The endless amount of speed cameras, average speed checks, hidden police speed checking vehicles. It is simply not fair and must be halted.",
