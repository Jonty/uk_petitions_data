        "additional_details": "HPV, for example is contracted through sexual activity and is a leading cause for cervical cancer. Regardless of age, anyone can contract HPV and although it is now immunised for in most teenage girls, many women have no idea of the damage it causes before it's too late. A cervical screen test / smear test - is a method of detecting abnormal cells on the cervix. The cervix is the entrance to the womb from the vagina. Detecting and removing abnormal cervical cells can prevent cervical cancer.",
        "background": "The legal national age for consent is 16. Smear tests aren't available until the age of 25. Meaning that any given woman could go for up to 9 years, without being screened for abnormal and dangerous cells.",
