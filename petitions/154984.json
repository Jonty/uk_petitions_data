        "additional_details": "It would also seem hugely hypocritical for any vote leave backers to remain in salaried positions at the European parliament now that the UK has voted to leave. Now their protest has been fulfilled, it is time to allow those with the skills and mindset to develop a positive and lasting relationship with the other 27 nations to take their place, however limited that time may be.",
        "background": "After the vote leave campaign was successful in the recent UK Referendum, we are in a time that requires diplomacy and negotiation with our European neighbours. It is my firm belief that that Mr Farage is an antagonist and threat to any future deal the UK and EU could broker and he must be removed.",
