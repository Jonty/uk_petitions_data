I have raised three children alone and succeeded in my life with the support of the laws of our land which protect the rights of women. I work two jobs as a tutor of sculpture in schools and communities, i also support speech and language therapy programs for young adults in a supported learning environment. \r\nEvery day since 20th January, i have watched with horror the anti-progressive, backward actions of this US administration. Is this who WE are? \r\n\r\n  ",

Stop his influence, condoned by this state sponsored visit and save our Queen the indignity of shaking the hand of a self confessed woman abuser. \r\n",
