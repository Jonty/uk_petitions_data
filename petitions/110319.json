        "action": "Increase the Carer's Allowance for all UK carers even if inflation is negative",
        "additional_details": "Carer's Allowance, the payment given to carers, is estimated to save the United Kingdom government \u00a3300 in social care costs per year of every pound paid in carer's allowance. As of 2011, there are around 6.5 million carers in the United Kingdom (suggesting the Government is saving costs of \u00a31.95 billion a year). When benefits are uprated each year (except those where different rules apply) the CPI rate of inflation is used, therefore with inflation this low, there is the chance of a reduction.",
        "background": "We, the undersigned, call upon the United Kingdom Government and the Chancellor of the Exchequer increase the allowance for 2016/2017 even if inflation is reported to be negative in November 2015.",
