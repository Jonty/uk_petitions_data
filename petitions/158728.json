        "additional_details": "Multiple statements have been made in campaigns - both sides - referring to research that shows the current EU Nationals working in the UK as having made a hugely positive net impact to the economy.\r\nFull detail of future entitlement could take years to define, by which stage there could be irreversible loss of valued labour due to uncertainty. \r\nA separate Bill could cover this aspect promptly, independent of future migration policies. Home Office and Inland Revenue could enact at low effort.",
        "background": "The uncertainty created by the EU Referendum, the subsequent leadership vacuum, and the posturing of parties is possibly causing more damage to the economy than actual changes will.\r\nDamage to the labour aspect of the economy could be minimised by an independent decision on those already here.",
