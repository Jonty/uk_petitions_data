        "action": "Prevent the sale of ARM Holdings to Softbank",
        "additional_details": "If the government truly believes in businesses that can compete in the world then it must realise it takes decades to develop companies such as ARM and coming under foreign ownership when not needed is only ultimately strategically beneficial for the foreign company and bad for national self-esteem.  \r\n\r\nThe sale of ARM will represent the end of real British involvement in any significant way in the ever-growing, ever important technology sector. ",
        "background": "The government should prevent the sale of ARM, the biggest and most successful British technology company to the Japanese company Softbank.  With designs used in over 90% of devices, the idea that only another company can support its growth is invalid.     \r\n",
