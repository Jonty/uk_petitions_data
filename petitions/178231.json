        "action": "Temporarily ban breeding of domestic animals until UK pet crisis is manageable.",
        "additional_details": "It is our societies decisions that have led to the number of abandoned animals increasing year on year. Rescue centres are overwhelmed  and it is our responsibility to change this.\r\n102,363 stray and abandoned dogs were handled by local Authorities between 2014-2015, and the RSPCA alone rescued almost 119,000 animals.",
        "background": "We believe preventing breeding of domestic animals for monetary gain will decrease the number of animals living in cages. Why when there are so many animals without homes are we letting people keep breeding more?. They clearly have no thought for the animals, just the money they can make. ",
