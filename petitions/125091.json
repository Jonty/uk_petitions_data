        "additional_details": "Disabled folks, rely on pip payments, and believe me they aint alot, they just.   about maintain  as far as possible, an independent, and dignified standard of living, that the majority of the population take for granted. They make the difference to me between a short taxi ride once a month to see some freinds. Or seeing know one. For weeks most disabled cant work so cant make up this loss. Is this a fair society.",
        "background": "I had a stroke 4 years ago. but cant really walk so good, take away the pip payments im pretty much housebound, as most of it is used on transport. Pip gives us a small payment each month to maintain our independence of which we work hard to achieve, dont take it away, its vital to our independence",
