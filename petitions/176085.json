        "additional_details": "Figures show that attacks on NHS staff are rising. With stretched resources, higher demand and rising waiting times the NHS can ill afford this violence.\r\nFor twenty years it has been a specific offence to attack a Police officer conducting their duties. (Section 89(1) of the Police Act 1996)\r\nWe the undersigned believe it is time to extend this higher legal provision and protection to NHS medical staff and make it a specific offence to assault them.",
        "background": "There are 185 attacks on NHS staff a day in England. It is unacceptable that dedicated staff should both fear and face violence whilst caring for the sick. For 20 years it has been a specific offence to attack a Police officer. Give the same protection to our medical staff.",
