        "additional_details": "I was personally tested by a dyslexia specialist however my full dyslexia report stating support, such as extra time, that I needed for exams has now been ignored after doing a simplifide dyslexia test that I did in school. They also did not accept any other external infomation provided from a dyslexia specialist. I feel like my dyslexia report was refused by the school because I was sucsessful in my GCSE exams. I therefore believe that testing within school should be done with a specialist.",
        "background": "People who are dyslexic are not gaining enought support from school due to the fact that the tests used are not effective enought to provide infomation to state that they are infact dyselxic. Also external testing done by dyslexic specialists are not accepted. We want change. ",
