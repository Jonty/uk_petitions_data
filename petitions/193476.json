        "additional_details": "The questions are things like, can you shower, can you go to the toilet, can you move around your home. There's people who can do all of these things but are not able to work, therefore would really benefit from this money. Also people who are not mentally stable but have children could benefit from this money to make sure their children can go into a private nursery or childminders when they are having a bad day or week, this way the children is less likely to be affected by the mothers health",
        "background": "I would like this action because I feel that the questions that are asked for personal independence payment are only for people with physical disabilities, the questions do not concentrate on people with mental disabilities. I also think that someone with children should get more points. ",
