        "additional_details": " Incidents like the one on the 14th February 2016 where a laser was shone at a Virgin Atlantic aircraft endanger both the crew and the passengers. Lasers are being used as weapons to shine at aircraft and should therefore be treated as such by British Law. It is vitally important that the government take action as such incidents will continue to increase in frequency, thereby increasing the likelihood of a catastrophe.\r\n\r\nhttp://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35575861\r\n",
