        "additional_details": "Darts meets almost all requirements stipulated by the Olympic charter.\r\n\r\nSports with similar characteristics are currently already included in the Olympic programme such as Archery and Shooting. Darts is a true test of precision, accuracy, strategy, hand-eye coordination and pressure.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned urge the Government to step in, in order for Darts to have the best chance at becoming an Olympic Sport, and to gain the recognition the sport and it's competitors deserve.",
        "background": "The Secretary of State for Culture, Media and Sport should create a task force in order to lobby the IOC for Darts to be recognised as a sport. They should then have direct involvement in the process of applying to become an Olympic Sport at the earliest opportunity. \r\n\r\n\r\n",
