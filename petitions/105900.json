        "additional_details": "Family Law Courts are outdated in many ways and it has to move forward with the times. No more draconian ways. How many children have to suffer without their parents? How many parents have to suffer without their children?\r\nThose years when separation is imposed upon by Laws that are Victorian and outdated, think of the years that can never be replaced.\r\nWhen one parent loses custody. Is it right for that child to be stripped of contact with their Grandparents, Aunts and Uncles?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "Children's Voices need to be heard, they can no longer sit in silence and be fearful of authority. They need to be able to trust and confide in individuals and not be called liars.\r\nParents need to stop being gagged. This is draconian, and they should be able to speak about their individual cases.",
