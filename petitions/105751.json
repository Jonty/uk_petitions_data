        "additional_details": "The A14 is a well known accident hot spot, the junction to our village has no filter lane and access across the bridge depends on if your face fits.  .Having spoken to the County Council, local police, local MP and Parish Council it has been suggested that a petition is raised to apply for a change of use.  The only other way the situation will be looked into is if there is a fatality Now is the time for change not after a child dies\r\nPlease offer your support not your condolences  ",
        "background": "Getting to the neighbouring villages means running the risk of death or serious injury for even the most experienced driver. We believe the public bridleway should allow ALL villagers, via reasonable means, bike, moped walking, etc safe access across this dangerous road not just a selected few\r\n",
