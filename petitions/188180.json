        "additional_details": "People unelected to represent the people should not talk in their name, act in their name or hold sway in their name. The members of the Lords are mostly privileged ,political appointments and a scattering of working class people mainly there to give it the semblance of legitimacy.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Lord in frustrating the Brexit referendum clearly show their contempt for the people they are purported to represent. It is time this house had real accountability and legitimacy by being their at the will of the people not despite the people.",
        "background": "It is clear that those born of a particular circumstance , and those that have gained political favour have been given a greater say on the affairs and lives of the British public. This is an intolerable situation and we need to come into line with every other major democracy in the world. ",
