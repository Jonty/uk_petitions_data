        "additional_details": "As a working mother with a partner who works we find it extremely difficult to pay for holidays that are not in term time with holidays costing more than 50% more than they do during school terms. I find it extremely disgraceful that we as parents can not choose what is best for our own children that the government are trying to take control, they are going from one extreme to another! Please sign this petition if you as well would like to decide for your own child!",
