        "additional_details": " The main example at the moment is Rossendale in Lancashire who currently have issued 1864 drivers badges for a population of just 65,000 people most of the 1864 are working in other areas for which they have no knowledge. Also this means that the council's for the areas these people are working in have no information about them or their cars. We think this should be altered as soon as possible as this poses a potential public safety risk.\r\nthe lancashire telegraph published a story on this on 07/10/2015",
        "background": "as the current law stands a taxi driver may gain his badge and hackney plate anywhere in England and then go to another area and work for a cab firm as a private hire vehicle. ",
