        "additional_details": "The increase in puppy prices is soring, in turn there are more irresponsible breeders and owners breeding just to make quick cash! they're not been bred for health or temprement, this is causing rescues to overflow as these puppies are growing into unhealthy untrainable and some cases dangerous dogs. This petition is to enforce licences on all dog owners and breeders and make them liable for any consequences of their dogs! Those caught not been licenced need prosecuting or jail! ",
        "background": "Everyone should be registered on a database & buy a dog licence that wants to own one! Anyone breeding be it once or several times should have to be checked by an authority to show they are equipped and have the education to do it properly, the laws need to be toughened up on those who abuse them!",
