        "additional_details": "Science agrees that human development begins at conception: \r\n\u201cHuman development begins after the union of male and female gametes or germ cells during a process known as fertilization (conception).\u201d[Moore, Keith L. Essentials of Human Embryology. Toronto: B.C. Decker Inc, 1988, p.2]\r\n\r\nAs the fertilized embryo has all the genetic components of an individual human they should receive the same rights as born humans. The right to life is a fundamental cornerstone to western society as we know it and abortions stand in direct opposition to that right.",
        "background": "An innocent life is being taken whenever an abortion is performed. As someone who pays taxes to a great health service, I want to see this procedure removed from the NHS.",
