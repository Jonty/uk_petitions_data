        "additional_details": "I have been a member of TMOBILE and now EE for many years now and have contracts for 3 family members. My sister had called and asked for unlimited mins on her price plan but didn't realise it starts next bill and has been charged \u00a3436.85 +vat for 900 minutes the total for a price plan on average is \u00a335pcm with unlimited minutes and texts including some data. What makes it execptable to charge this amount? No wonder we as a country are falling into thousands of pounds worth of debt.",
        "background": "Hi my name is Laura, I would like the UK goverment to put a realistic amount on all mobile price plans when certain minutes are used outside of price plans. This could be an additional debt solution as mobile bills play a part in the younger generation falling victim to debt.",
