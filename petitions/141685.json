        "action": "Rerun of EU referendum due to misleading campaigns placed before the voters.",
        "additional_details": "Since the original vote factors put forward are now shown as incorrect including the basis if a leave campaign being to transfer payments into the EU to fund the NHS which are now being receeded upon. A serious devaluation in the economy and an emergence of uncertainty around the decision made by those who voted in favour of leaving. Plus a lack of clear debate around strategy to safeguard jobs and prevent further discrimination within the UK must favour the need to validate with a re-vote.",
        "background": "The arguments put forward for consideration to the British public were misleading and not properly outlined. Thus making a just decision impossible. A democratic vote must be based on valid fact when so important to the future of the country. A re run of the EU referendum must be considered now.",
