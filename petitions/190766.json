        "additional_details": "The United Kingdom is made up of England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Devolution essentially means the transfer of powers from the UK parliament in London to assemblies in Cardiff and Belfast, and the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nA United Kingdom should be run from one location with equal representation from all parts.\r\n\r\nDevolution is divisive and human nature will have each part constantly trying to grab more power and to fight the other parts. ",
        "background": "The entire population of the UK should have a referendum to abolish devolved parliaments (national assemblies). In 2004 according to the daily telegraph it cost \u00a3650  million a year to run. It causes division and friction. We should have a choice to go back to one inclusive parliament. ",
