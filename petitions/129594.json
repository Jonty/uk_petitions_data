        "action": "Stop foreign men using marriage to live in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "This loophole for foreign men was closed in 1969 but was re-opened by the next Labour Home Secretary. The Conservatives promised to close the loophole again in their 1979 election manifesto, but did not keep their promise.",
        "background": "Marriage is a loophole in visa constraints. Abolishing the spouse visa would be for the common good, because England is over-crowded and the UK has more young men than young women. It would not prevent women from marrying foreign men because they can live in the husband's country, as is normal.",
