The British public do not have confidence in the prime minister nor the Conservative party and want a general election. ",
        "background": "The Prime minister did not have a plan for Brexit. It seems he was sure of a remain victory so never bothered with a decisive plan of action if the public voted to leave the EU despite holding a referendum regardless.  This has left the country wondering with uncertainty what is going to happen. ",
