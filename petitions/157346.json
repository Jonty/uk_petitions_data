        "additional_details": "UK citizens have been badly let down by their elected representatives.  Referendum campaigning featured lies and misinformation. Many 'Leavers' cast their votes to protest their sense of disenfranchisement. Neither side in the referendum has any strategic plans for the future. The referendum has not even been debated by Parliament. Current leadership issues reinforce the feeling of a country lacking unity and direction. Only a coalition of the best and brightest can lead us out of this disaster ",
        "background": "Economic ruin, social collapse, the breakup of the United Kingdom face us. Political parties are in chaos. There is no leadership or coherent strategy. The main political parties must form a coalition, setting aside the referendum result to build a safe, fair future for UK citizens within the EU.",
