        "background": "The Act is deficient in that it allows hunt clubs to ride out with hounds. Hounds do not abide by the law. They pick up the scent of a fox, they chase. The law continues to be flouted in the UK and foxes are still being killed. If hunt clubs aren't hunting, there's no requirement for hunt hounds. ",
