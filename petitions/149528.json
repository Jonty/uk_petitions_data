        "action": "RAISE Tariffs on IMPORTED steel to keep British Steel ALIVE.",
        "additional_details": "Our Steel Industry has been decimated over the years by cheap Chinese and other low labour cost nation imports. LEVY IT. This will promote projects within the UK to use British Steel thus reviving the industry, producing jobs and a renewed sense of pride within ourselves. Moreover, to support and kick start this I want capital, state projects to ONLY use British Steel. Beginning with HS2 and other ongoing projects. I believe this will boost economic output and GDP and benefit us all immensely.",
        "background": "Our manufacturing sector has been decimated over decades of neglect and a sense of simply not caring. A strong manufacturing sector constitutes a resilient, strong, diverse and booming economy. WE NEED MORE THAN JUST SERVICES. We can begin by raising tariffs on imported, cheap steel.",
