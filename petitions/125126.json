        "additional_details": "Clean air technology exists in the form of electric engines, batteries, and hydrogen fuel cells. Cars and other vehicles powered by this technology are currently expensive, and out of the reach of most consumers and business. However, legislation could increase the pace of innovation within automotive industries in order to make such technology cheap and available to all. This will be a big step towards the cleaner brighter future that we all deserve.",
        "background": "Air pollution is linked to 40,000 early deaths per year in the UK. A major contributor to the state of air quality is the use of vehicles powered by fossil fuels on Britain's roads. Climate change and health implications aside, just imagine the air in our cities being as fresh as an alpine breeze.",
