        "additional_details": "NHS staff undertaking additional agency work have experienced pay caps from 2016. In a profession marred with pay caps and freezes and a record number taking out pay day loans these vital NHS staff are forced to undertake agency work to plug the gap in income. NHS staff have rights to exercise their skills and maximise their earning potential, and find expression in their right to private life under the Human Rights Act 1998 and their right to work under the Fundamental Charter of the EU.",
        "background": "The NHS Inprovement directive potentially forbids NHS trusts from allowing full time substantive NHS staff undertaking agency shifts in another trust. This is in breach of the agreed rules and practices of established Framework agreements, under which agencies supply nurses to Trusts.",
