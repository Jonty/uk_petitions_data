        "additional_details": "We have spent some 5 months debating the issues of the debate. The public will not want this dragged out any longer. This is just another EU attempt to subvert the wishes of the people and to override their opinion.\r\n\r\nThis is not the first time the EU have tried to hold additional referendums to get their own way. We must stand firm and state that the public have spoken and should not just be listened to, but to enact their wish as called for in a democratic society.",
        "background": "I Call on the government to honour the referendum and to ignore the call for a second referendum. The remain campaign are trying to get a second referendum to over turn the first. This is typical EU behaviour and is undemocratic. We have had our vote and it should be honoured without further ado.",
