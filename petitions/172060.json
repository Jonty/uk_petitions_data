        "additional_details": "The UK-US special relationship has been built on shared values, objectives & defence over many years. We the undersigned want the special relationship to continue but it can only be special if those values, objectives & defence are still shared. Donald Trump has been democratically elected president of the US, having made remarks during his campaign that many in the UK do not agree with. It is not our place to interfere with who is US president, but we can decide how we respond to the choice.",
