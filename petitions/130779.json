        "additional_details": "By allowing this to happen, the government is not doing enough to close the gap between the rich and the poor. Every year, 5 top independent schools send over 2000 pupils to Oxbridge between them. These kids have almost definitely performed well on the same exams as your sons and daughters whilst driving up the grade boundaries and making it harder to achieve top grades to apply to top universities. How can a child who did not pay for their education be expected to compete with children who did?",
        "background": "Privately educated children should sit different GCSE and A Level exams to children from state schools. This is because the quality of education for children who's parents are paying over \u00a315k a year will undoubtedly be very different to a student attending the local state school.",
