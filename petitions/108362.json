        "additional_details": "Significant cuts have been made to the budgets for the elderly for their care and providing the help they need. The evidence is with Charities and from families of people who have loved ones who are not getting the help they need with their day to day care and to be able to live an independent life without the worry of having to pay bills and to be able to feed themselves. This needs to be made Law so it is enforced and can not be changed by Local Authorities to meet their targets.",
        "background": "The Government Austerity plan has made it difficult for L A's to provide money for Care of the Elderly & big cuts have already been made. In future cuts this budget is not ring fenced &  this is where funds will be cut to provide for refugees and illegal immigrants that are coming daily into the UK.",
