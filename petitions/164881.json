        "action": "Raise compulsory education starting age to 7",
        "additional_details": "The starting age of compulsory education in this country is the same as in the Netherlands - 5 (or the year in which a pupil approaches their 5th birthday). It is too young to start formal schooling. Compare this to almost all nations in Continental Europe, where the age is raised to 7 - there is less stress and the people are happier and more satisfied. Children need time to mature at their own pace, and forcing them into premature schooling is not the answer.",
        "background": "The current starting age in this country is far too young when compared to the European Continent. 4 or 5 is too young an age and can cause unnecessary pressure on parent, teacher and child due to the child being thrust into a more \"mature\" environment when they are not ready for it.",
