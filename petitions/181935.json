        "additional_details": "It states that he killed a 45, 13 and two 11 year old because he was looking through music on his phone. He was driving at 50mph when he hit the car which killed 4 people. Another man, killed a cyclist even though he was convicted 8 times before hand for using his mobile phone. The cyclist was competing in a 10 mile time trial, and was sadly killed because of a van driver was too busy looking at a text. This driver attended 2 driving awareness courses as well. Yet, he still carried on. ",
        "background": "The penalties for driving using a mobile phone is too low. It should be a years ban from driving, with added points for when they have their license back and a higher fine of \u00a31,000. This would be a good deterrent. 1 man on the A34 killed a whole family.",
