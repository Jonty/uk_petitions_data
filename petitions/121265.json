        "additional_details": "Since being made redundant, my friend has been unable to get another job because 35 years ago, he took a hub cap off a dumped car and on another occasion altered a road tax disk. Employers are unlikely to offer him a job because of it. In fact, a criminal with one serious offence that has lapsed can have his/her record filtered after a period of time.\r\nI think petty recorded crimes recorded over decades ago should be filtered also. The current system is ridiculous and discriminatory.",
