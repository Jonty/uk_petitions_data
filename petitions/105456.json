        "additional_details": "As most people will have a blank chip, the exceptions would be quickly filtered out and dealt with.  For example, an injured child taken to A&E would be recognized as 'at risk'.\r\n\r\nIllegal immigrants will not have a chip, so would be easier to isolate and process.\r\n\r\nFor a fuller understanding of this, carefully constructed, national framework for protecting privacy without hiding wrongdoing, watch: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rw99cHR8mzg\r\n",
        "background": "By default, the only thing stored on the chip will be the holder's biometrics (encrypted); no identity information, not even a name.\r\n\r\nParliament must decide whether some exceptions, such as criminals or children at risk, should have identity and other information encrypted onto their chip. \r\n",
