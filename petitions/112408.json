My own dog accidently got into my garden 5 days after Guy Fawkes night she got such a scare when a firework suddenly went off that she fled and was missing for 2 and a half hours.  Owners get frantic about their pets welfare. There are also old people who are frightened at the bangs and flashes it is a reminder of bombs going off in wartime.",

Wildlife are killed every year, children are maimed and injured. Many dogs and cats and other pets have to be sedated.",
