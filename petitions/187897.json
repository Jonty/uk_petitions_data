        "action": "Increase the funding into grassroots football in the UK.",
        "additional_details": "I have sustained injuries on the current playing fields near my house playing for my local side. Furthermore, I know many others who have had similar experiences to myself. I believe that if we had better grass to play on, it would motivate more of the public to get involved in the sport as well as just getting healthier as a nation. By improving grassroots football, we are becoming healthier and more motivated. Football is just the beginning ,we could also improve rugby pitches and many more.",
        "background": "I believe the state of amateur football picthes across the UK is appalling. The amount of injuries sustained to young and old footballers is increasing on these sort of playing fields. In my opinion, by improving pitches it will not only benefit football in general but the entire nation as a whole. ",
