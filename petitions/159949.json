That comes to \u00a37.1bn a year or \u00a3136 million a week.  \r\nhttp://www.theguardian.com/politics/reality-check/2016/may/23/does-the-eu-really-cost-the-uk-350m-a-week\r\nhttps://fullfact.org/europe/our-eu-membership-fee-55-million/",
        "background": "The referendum was not fair and should be declared invalid because \u201cLeave\u201d prominently used false figures to stir up loathing of the EU. The EU doesn\u2019t take from us \u00a3350m/week as Leave claimed on their bus and posters. The true net figure is about \u00a3136m/week or under 1% of government spending. ",
