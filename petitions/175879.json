        "action": "The Government should recognise Taiwan's right for national self determination.",
        "additional_details": "This petition is not about requesting that the UK Government recognises Taiwan as a country but instead that it recognises that it is for the people of Taiwan to determine their future free of threats from the Chinese Government.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese Government's claim to control the destiny of the people Taiwan is a dangerous and outdated philosophy based on colonialism. This is because although Taiwan was once part of mainland China it has not been for almost a 120 years.",
        "background": "The UK Government should revise its view of the 'One China Policy' to recognize that Taiwan is a beacon of democracy in Asia and that it is for the people of Taiwan to decide their future and not the Chinese Communist Party, which is known to be an authoritarian and oppressive government.",
