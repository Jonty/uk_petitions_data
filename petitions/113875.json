        "additional_details": "I am not asking for Cannabis to be legal in general, however we are asking for the Government to do more research into using Cannabis to cure cancer, and list it as a official cancer drug, should there be positive results in doing so. The government simply says that it will stay illegal as it causes effects (even though alcohol is just as bad) when we want it to be allowed when it comes to medical reasons!",
        "background": "The government needs to start doing more research into Cannabis curing cancer. The government says that it is a harmful drug, however there is evidence that alcohol causes a lot more effects that Cannabis  does, resulting in thousands of deaths per year in the UK. ",
