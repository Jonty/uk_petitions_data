        "action": "protect workers on universal credit by having their 'housing element' protected.",
        "additional_details": "I have been sanctioned my personal element of \u00a3317.82 for 63 days (for missing one appointment) which means the element to buy food and pay bills has gone, then because I work part time my wages are then deducted from my housing element ALSO. This is only going to lead to homelessness and severe hardship and debt. The person affected can not claim back bank charges from unpaid direct debits so they are in debt/arrears and face being homeless EVEN if this sanction is later overturned.",
        "background": "unfair sanctions mean part time workers lose their 'standard' allowance, (money to live on), and THEN have their wages deducted from their rent element aswell. So they have no money to pay bills/bank charges, no money to buy food but also no money to cover all their rent and face becoming homeless.",
