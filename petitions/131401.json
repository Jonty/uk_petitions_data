        "additional_details": "Where there is no risk of compromise to individuals or families, the presumption must be that all public or committee meetings should be live-streamed so citizens have less reason to distrust politicians or civil servants. If there is nothing to hide, there is nothing to fear is what we are told by government agencies concerned with surveillance and monitoring, so the same should apply to government. The United Kingdom should be a world leader in \"glasnost\" not forever in the shadows.",
