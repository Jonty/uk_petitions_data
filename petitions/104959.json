        "additional_details": "There is very little effective regulation in place to monitor registered charities or unregistered groups. Too many collect money from the general public under the pretence that they offer a service to the ex-military community when they actually offer no service or an unnecessary service. This directly effects other charities and shouldn't be allowed to happen. \r\nUnauthorised use of the logo should be an offence with permission  granted by the MoD, possibly monitored locally via the covenant. ",
        "background": "There are many 'service' charities purporting to support serving or former members of the Armed Forces. A stringent criteria and logo would give confidence to both the general public and beneficiaries and minimise the duplication of services. This would also affect unwanted organisations.",
