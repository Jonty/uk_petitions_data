        "additional_details": "The only messages Claire Perry managed to convey in a recent interview with The Argus (http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/14557427.Rail_Minister__Unions_are_launching_a_war_on_passengers/?ref=fbpg) are finger-pointing, inflammatory and provocative, and she has contributed nothing towards resolving the ongoing dispute between GTR and its staff that anyone can see. The last thing GTR passengers want at this moment in time is a government minister to add fuel to the fire.",
        "background": "The recent interview with The Argus demonstrated that Claire Perry has no clue how to resolve a dispute to the mutual benefit of all stakeholders. She has shown no professionalism with inflammatory comments and cannot be entrusted as a public servant at DfT to work for the long suffering passengers.",
