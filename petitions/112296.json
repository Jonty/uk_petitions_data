They are selling off all our national institutions & bargain prices to there rich friends so they can get richer at the cost of our 'The British Peoples' lives. This is a petition to stop any chance of the privatization of any part of the NHS. It should be there for the people at no cost (As that's what we pay NI for) as it has been for so many in there time of need. We need to protect the NHS from any privatization.!",
        "background": "The NHS has been the pride of our country & envy of others for as long as it has been around. The Tory government has been cutting the funding & bringing it to breaking point in order for it to fail so they can sell 'Our' NHS off to private investors. This needs to stop.! NOW.!",
