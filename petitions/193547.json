        "action": "Negotiate for British citizens to exchange citizenship with other EU nationals.",
        "additional_details": "As the situations of the many EU nationals living in the UK, and the many British citizens living throughout the EU, are now highly uncertain, and as many British citizens wish not to lose their EU citizenship as a result of the UK Government's leaving the EU, and as many EU citizens, especially those who have lived and worked long in the UK, wish to remain in the UK, this would allow numbers to remain stable, and ensure those in the UK genuinely wished to be British.",
        "background": "We call on the government to negotiate an agreement with the EU, or failing that bilateral agreements where possible with member states of the EU, to permit British Citizens who wish to remain EU citizens to exchange their citizenship with citizens of those member states who wish to become British.",
