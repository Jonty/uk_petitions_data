        "additional_details": "Other licence operators around the world are recognising this has become an issue, most recently New South Wales introduced more stringent regulations than those we ask for in this petition.\r\n \r\nThe petitioners want to see the following:\r\n \r\nBookmakers must accept a legitimate stake up to \u00a325 on all accounts, and restrictions must not restrict to under \u00a325. Bookmakers also be banned from closing accounts of successful punters or refuse to accept a new account.",
        "background": "It has become a common practice for bookmakers within the UK and that operate in the UK to restrict or close the accounts of successful punters. Everyday, countless accounts are closed because of punters searching out best odds on comparison sites and selecting more winners than losers.",
