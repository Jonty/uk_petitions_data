        "additional_details": "A fundamental tenet of democracy is that those representing the people are accountable to the people. There should, therefore, be some way of demonstrating this accountability. \r\nOver 190000 people signed a petition calling for PM Cameron to be held accountable for his Government's actions. The regulations currently do not allow this to happen. \r\nWe propose that the regulations are changed so that in the future MPs can be held to account, by the people, for their actions on behalf of the people.",
        "background": "190000 people have been informed by email that their petition to hold PM Cameron to account via a Vote of No Confidence has been rejected due to the Petitions Committee \"not having the power to schedule [this type of] debate\". We propose the regulations be amended to give the Committee this power.",
