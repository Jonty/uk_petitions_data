        "additional_details": "Surrounded on 2 sides by sea & closer to Europe and China than Gatwick or Heathrow. Air freight at Manston would reduce the millions of freight lorries passing through the port of Dover where infrastructure is very poor. Encourage development at the ports of Ramsgate and Tilbury make a new Thames crossing more financially viable \r\nReduce high air pollution levels in Dover & Southeast\r\nThe population of Thanet & UKIP led council want an airport at Manston and need the employment opportunity.\r\n",
        "background": "The former Manston  RAF airstrip has an existing runway capable of use by largest  air freight planes. Thanet has good infrastructure, close to  ports of Dover & Ramsgate. Transferring all air freight  to Manston would eliminate need for third runway at Gatwick or Heathrow & improve air quality .",
