        "additional_details": "\r\nBelow is taken from the gov.uk website\r\n\r\nMost workers who work a 5-day week must receive 28 days\u2019 paid annual leave per year. This is calculated by multiplying a normal week (5 days) by the annual entitlement of 5.6 weeks.\r\n\r\nLimits on statutory leave\r\n\r\nStatutory paid holiday entitlement is limited to 28 days. Staff working 6 days a week are only entitled to 28 days\u2019 paid holiday and not 33.6 days (5.6 multiplied by 6).",
        "background": "Currently a worker who works a six day week is only entitled to the same statutory annual leave as a worker who works a 5 day week. Despite the 5 day worker getting an extra 52 days leave a year a 6 day worker is not entitled to anymore. Lets change this so a 6 day worker gets another 8 days a year.",
