Our politicians bicker like children and exaggerate - governing with fear rather than facts. It is having a negative impact on everyone - particularly vulnerable or impressionable people. You cannot fill a country with fear and hatred without consequences. The government and media must recognise their influence and change the manner in which they conduct themselves.",
