        "additional_details": "The OECD revealed this week that Britain spends \u00a31 in every \u00a37 on Foreign aid.\r\nWhen councils are forced to cut budgets, it is an insult when the Government insists on spending 0 7% of our national output on Foreign Aid, especially when it is wasted on giving China millions of pounds on a space project.\r\nAdded to that is evidence that not all of the money that is committed goes to its intended destination.\r\nFor example, the disclosure that almost \u00a31bn was sent to the most 20 corrupt countries.\r\n",
        "background": " The Government should repeal the commitment to spend 0.7% of national income.\r\nIn 2010, the total Foreign Aid budget stood at \u00a38.4bn. By 2020 this will have risen to almost \u00a316bn\r\nIn tough economic times it is wrong to spend taxpayers' money in this way.\r\nIt's time to cut Foreign Aid.",
