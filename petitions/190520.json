        "action": "Re-apply for Membership of the European Union once we Leave by 2020.",
        "additional_details": "Since the referendum result, thousands of 'Leave' voters have realised their own mistake, prompting them to regret their personal decision. The European Union provides reliable allies who essentially produce security and stability. Leaving the European Union means that we will also HAVE to withdraw from the Single Market. This has resulted in a vast amount of jobs being created, leading to growth and prosperity. The European Union is incredibly unique. Don't waste this opportunity.",
        "background": "The European Union is a cherished community of Nations which allows each individual state to develop and prosper in its own way. The UK's decision to leave the EU was disastrous, causing our nation to become more divided than ever. Sign this petition to aid the government in realising our mistake.",
