        "additional_details": "In March 2016 NHS England stated that they were 'not responsible for commissioning PrEP\u2019. Following a legal challenge from the National AIDS Trust, which the NHS wasted time and money appealing, the Court of Appeal has ruled that the NHS has the legal power to fund PrEP. \r\n\r\nThe NHS\u2019s decision has already been delayed for over 6 months, so we urgently call on Jeremy Hunt to make PrEP available on the NHS. \r\n\r\nEvery day the NHS delays its decision, 17 more people will be diagnosed with HIV. \r\n",
        "background": "PrEP stands for Pre-Exposure Prophylaxis. It's a course of HIV drugs for HIV negative people to take before sex to reduce their risk of contracting HIV. Research demonstrates that PrEP is as effective as condoms in preventing HIV transmission. ",
