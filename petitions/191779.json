        "additional_details": "It is widely held that the fundamental truth of nuclear weapons is that they can never be used, furthermore by reducing the size of our nuclear arsenal we would be setting a precedent for other countries to do the same, in a time of growing tensions between nations we could be held up as an example to others, instead of another country making irrational paranoid policy decisions based on no evidence. The money can be invested in healthcare, a cause on which there is consensus across party lines",
        "background": "While there may be valid reasons for the United Kingdom to possess a nuclear arsenal, the size of said arsenal is completely arbitrary due to mutually assured destruction, there is no reason the same benefits cannot be achieved with a greatly reduced nuclear arsenal. ",
