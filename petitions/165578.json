A ban on these companies would very likely decrease the sales of unhealthy goods in this country and help to decrease the obesity epidemic.",

Food and drinks companies have some of the best marketing in the world. \r\n\r\nIf we can eliminate advertising of fizzy drinks and junk food, we can work to really reduce the obesity epidemic which the western world is in the grip of.",
