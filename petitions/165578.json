        "additional_details": "There was a time where Santa's suit was Green, Red or Tan depending on the person drawing it, then Coca Cola came along and used Santa as part of their Christmas marketing drive and since then we've all come to know the jolly fat man in the red suit.\r\n\r\nAdvertising is extremely powerful and has a huge influence on the purchasing decisions of our nation. A ban on these companies would very likely decrease the sales of unhealthy goods in this country and help to decrease the obesity epidemic.",
        "background": "There is no arguing that marketing companies make an impact. Food and drinks companies have some of the best marketing in the world. \r\n\r\nIf we can eliminate advertising of fizzy drinks and junk food, we can work to really reduce the obesity epidemic which the western world is in the grip of.",
