        "action": "Continue the Dubs Amendment scheme that grants unaccompanied minors refuge.",
        "additional_details": "The minister for immigration Robert Goodwill has said the Government had 'reasonably' met the 'intention and spirit' of the Dubs Amendment. Evidently, this is not true as only just over 10% of the target has been met.\r\n It is estimated that there are 90,000 unaccompanied migrant children across Europe. At least 10,000 unaccompanied child refugees have disappeared after arriving in Europe, according to the EU's criminal intelligence agency. Many are feared to have fallen into the hands of organised trafficking syndicates. The UK needs to fulfill its responsibility to protect more of these children.",
        "background": "In 2016 a commitment was made to allow unaccompanied children to be offered safe refuge in the UK in the House of Commons but has now been revoked. It was thought up to 3000 children would be granted refuge, but the commitment has been closed with only 350 children resettled in the UK. ",
