There were two possible drivers and they simply refused to say who was driving.  This is not uncommon but it is effectively \r\nThe penalty was 6pts and \u00a3150.

This can be exploited where the offence alleged carries a higher penalty than that above (e.g. dangerous driving).\r\nThe penalty for failing to provide should match that of the offence allegedly committed by the driver.",
