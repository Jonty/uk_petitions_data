        "action": "Improve accessibility to state benefits for the poor and sick.",
        "additional_details": "With greater accessibility to benefits, the sick could focus more on their health. The foundation of state support would ease the suffering of people with mental illnesses, enabling greater engagement in treatment, and hastening their return to the workforce.\r\n\r\nRelying on a partner's low income hurts one's mental health, and much dignity is lost without the independence of a personal income. For those just above the income threshold, this will mean financial and emotional hardship. ",
        "background": "ESA living allowances must rise. Many get nothing beyond a partner's low income, creating hardship. Allowances for age should end. Under 25s get less than over 25s though their needs are the same. Eligibility criteria for Income Support should widen beyond lone parents, the pregnant and carers.\r\n",
