        "additional_details": "In the UK, almost 25% of the population are deemed obese, according to an NHS report from 2013. This continual increase in obesity levels indicates that we simply cannot afford to publicise fast food any more.\r\n\r\nIn 2003, general advertisement for tobacco was banned. Statistics further support benefits of this, with the percentage of people smoking decreasing by 7% between 2002 and 2013, which reiterates the possibility of banning fast food marketing having the same effect. ",
        "background": "With our constant surrounding of fast food advertisement, who wouldn't succumb to the indulgence? However, with children being the predominant victims, futures may be jeopardised by ill health and a lower quality of life. Therefore, we must address this issue now in order to reinstate healthy living",
