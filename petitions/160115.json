        "action": "Update voting technologies in the UK to ensure a fair, representative turnout.",
        "additional_details": "It is a shame that the EU referendum used 'traditional' voting systems, such as polling stations and postal votes. To ensure a rigourous, proportionally representative turn out, online voting facilities must be deployed in the future, otherwise population segments will remain disenfranchised.",
        "background": "A broader range of technologies for the population to use to vote in the UK would ensure a greater turn out. For example, the recent EU referendum. The voting system is out-dated, archaic and is suited to certain population segments. This is not truly democratic in a modern, technology driven age. ",
