We will never see world peace, but something has to be done to stop these attacks. I don't want our future generation to grow up in this mess. 9/11, Paris attacks, Lee Rigby, the poor man beheaded by ISIS. Please do something to stop these horrific attacks! David Cameron now is the time to actually save lives. Think of your own! ",

I fear for my life and the lives of others. Please close the borders, put our soldiers in cities, main events, stop police cuts, increase our safety.  Protect us.",
