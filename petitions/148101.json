        "additional_details": "Furthermore, the referendum result does not provide a sufficient mandate for the UK to leave the EU because 16 and 17 year olds were not allowed to vote (unlike the Scottish independence referendum) and not all territories voting (i.e. England, Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and Gibraltar) voted to leave.",
        "background": "Only 52% of people who voted in the European Union (EU) referendum on 23/6/16 voted to leave. Other countries, organisations and companies require a two thirds majority for a substantive change. Therefore, the result does not provide a sufficient mandate for the UK to leave the EU.",
