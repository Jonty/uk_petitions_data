        "additional_details": "On numerous occasions since the 5p plastic bag  law was passed, Superstores have abused their position of power by not ensuring that they have an adequate level of 5p plastic bags available for the business day. Customers are being forced to purchase the 6p bags once the 5p bags have ran out.\r\n\r\nI propose that in the event that a Superstore is unable to provide 5p plastic bags to customers, the Superstore will provide the 6p plastic bags at a reduced price of 5p.",
