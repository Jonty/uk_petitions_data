        "additional_details": "Linda Masarira, locked up since 6 July on trumped-up charges, has health problems & is the mother of 5 children (youngest 2 yrs). Accused of inciting riots in the female section of Chikurubi prison on 10/9, she was moved to solitary confinement in the dangerous male section \u2013 we fear for her safety. Other activists are also still incarcerated, many needing medical care after violent treatment by the police. Both Gift Siziba\u2019s hands are believed to be broken.  This vicious persecution must stop.",
        "background": "We ask the UK govt to raise the issue of persecution of activists with the Zimbabwe govt. The last election was hugely rigged. Misgovernance & corruption have destroyed the economy resulting in starvation & 90% unemployment. Civil unrest is growing & protesters refused bail & jailed without trial.",
