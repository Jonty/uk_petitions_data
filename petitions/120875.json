        "additional_details": "The new KS2 tests focus on grammar, reading and maths.  The concepts are so specific that creative writing, critical thinking, art and other subjects are likely to be cut as teachers scramble to spend more time drilling students.\r\n\r\nTeachers are aware that testing does not work.  A varied, rich, creative curriculum does.  We have ideas.  Why are we not being consulted?\r\n\r\nhttps://www.tes.com/news/school-news/breaking-views/take-absurdly-difficult-english-test-and-see-why-generation-students\r\n\r\n",
        "background": "The new Key Stage 2 tests show an incredible lack of foresight and knowledge of education today.  \r\n\r\nThis petition calls for the government to consult a randomly-selected range of teachers from across the UK whenever it wants to make changes to education policy.",
