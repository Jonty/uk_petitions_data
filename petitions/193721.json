        "additional_details": "The UK voted to LEAVE the EU & we have already wasted 9 months.  Now Article 50 has finally been triggered, it is already clear that the EU fully intends to 'punish' the UK & the British people.  We will continue to waste at least another 2 years & will ultimately either agree a bad deal or withdraw without any deal. We should therefore save 2 wasted years, tens of \u00a3Billions & another 1million+ immigrants entering the UK. We should cut our losses now & LEAVE the EU immediately.",
        "background": "The EU are already dictating to the UK what will & won't happen.  We will NOT be held to ransom by the EU so should cease discussions now with an immediate withdrawal and exit from the EU with no deal and reverting to WTO rules.",
