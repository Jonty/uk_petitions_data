        "additional_details": "Though it may reduce the rate on high emission vehicles, there is no benefit to the taxpayer unless the vehicle produces more than 266g/km due to the hefty first year rate.\r\n\r\nFor example a Lexus IS 300h Hybrid at the current rate costs \u00a340 over 3 years. Under the new scheme \u00a3560 would be the tax over 3 years.\r\n\r\nAlso this affects many Zero-Emission Cars such as the Tesla Model S. Currently they would pay \u00a30 but as the value is over \u00a340,000 when new, owners would have to pay \u00a3310 per year for an EV.",
        "background": "On the 1st April 2017, new Tax Laws are to be introduced that will introduce a flat rate for all non-Zero Emission to \u00a3140 per year and an additional \u00a3310 'premium' for all vehicles with a new price of \u00a340,000+. ",
