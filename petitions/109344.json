Under the terms of that Charter, the BBC is operationally and editorially independent of government and there is no provision for the government to intervene in the BBC\u2019s day-to-day operations.\r\n\r\nYou could write to the BBC directly to make this suggestion.\r\n\r\nIf there is a different action that you would like the Government or Parliament to take on this, and it's something that's within their power, you could start a petition asking specifically for that."
