Rather than waiting until the child becomes unwell and then discovering that their body cannot produce T-cells to fight the infection. If made aware earlier the bone marrow transplant will have an increased chance of being accepted, this will increase the death rates within the United Kingdom. ",

Children that have SCID basically have no immune system and in many cases this is discovered around 6 months and in most cases is fatal.",
