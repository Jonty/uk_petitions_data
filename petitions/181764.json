        "additional_details": "Earlier this year two young people lost their lives due to the complications arised from type 1diabetes. Unfortunately there currently is no cure, insulin is not a cure it is 'life support'. With early and correct diagnosis, and treatment a full life can be led. I know from experience that it is not easy, it is a rollercoaster every day, it never stops. However, anything is possible, you only need to look at our current Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nEarly diagnosis is key, it really can make a difference. \r\n",
        "background": "Type 1 diabetes is on the rise in the UK with many people not knowing the symptoms or how dangerous late diagnosis can be. A campaign is needed to educate not only parents but anyone who comes into contact with children. As a family we were fortunate that we knew the signs, we knew what to look for.",
