        "additional_details": "Much has been done to improve the water quality in our rivers and streams. Dumping into our waterways is commonplace and a disgrace. There is difficulty in  resolving these issues, but supermarket trolleys are one area that might be tackled.  A recent flood left a pile of 50+trolleys and tyres in a weirpool. Children were  climbing up and throwing trolleys into deep water of the weirpool.  2 kayakers were pushed by the current  into a submerged trolley, one being inverted. He nearly drowned.  ",
        "background": "There need to be a law mandating trolley owners, supermarkets etc, to fit security features such as coin locks or similar, in order to keep abandoned trolleys out of our river systems and countryside.",
