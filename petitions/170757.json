        "additional_details": "She most recently chaired an event in the Lords where there was mention of Israel being compared to terror group Islamic State and blaming the Jewish people for the Holocaust. There should be no place in the UK for Jew hatred, and in an age of growing antisemitism, we need to work to ensure we do not repeat the mistakes of the past. In addition, her actions were noted in a recent Home Affairs Committee report into \u2018Anti-Semitism in the UK\u2019 (chapter 6 point 123). ",
        "background": "Baroness Tonge has a reputation for making inflammatory, often antisemitic, statements against both Israel and the British Jewish leadership. She has brought the honours system into disrepute and should have her peerage removed. ",
