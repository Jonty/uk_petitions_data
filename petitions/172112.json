        "action": "End the ban on the creation of new grammar schools",
        "additional_details": "Your postcode should not determine your quality of education. Yet the gulf between the worst and best state schools is large and for many, private school is not an option. This has created severe educational inequality, which academic selection will help to address.\r\n\r\nGrammar schools should be a top priority in improving opportunities for bright, poorer students. The government should allow the creation of new grammar schools to widen access to a rigorous, traditional and academic education.\r\n",
        "background": "Planned expansions of existing grammar schools will not be enough to address educational inequality; bright children who live nowhere near to a potential expanded grammar school are being failed.  The ban on the creation of new grammar schools must be repealed. ",
