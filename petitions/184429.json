        "additional_details": "There can be no denying the positive impact EU citizens have made to the UK economy. However, we are facing the prospect of having to start new lives, leave friends, families, lovers, careers and future plans behind. To return all the investment we have made towards the prosperity of this country, would be just a small gesture, like a dream holiday booking cancellation, where the provider could no longer fulfill the Terms and Conditions.",
        "background": "As EU citizens living and working in the UK we have made a conscious decision to invest in this country and our futures. If we are not granted permanent residence all our tax contributions should be returned, as we will no longer be able to enjoy the fruits of our labour and love. ",
