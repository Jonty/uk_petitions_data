It costs about \u00a33.6m to train an Apache pilot.  At least 15 pilots have already resigned over the action being taken by the MOD. The MOD should just write this error off and stop pursuing the individual pilots. ",

It costs around \u00a33.6 million to train an Apache helicopter pilot. Losing pilots due to low morale and persecution is not worth the cost",
