        "additional_details": "With all respect i believe it is very unfair, in the summer i would like to be seeing my family abroad not doing exams 3 weeks early then just doing nothing at school. Most Countries Including America get like 3 month holidays i am not asking for that. I am just asking for you to consider my request that we can leave school for the holidays as soon as we finish our exams. However, I understand that in some occasions it may not be possible, but i am asking you to please consider this. ",
        "background": "We don't get long enough holidays but schools and local authorities feel they have the need to fine us just because we leave school at least a week early. I understand education Is vital, but at least let us leave school for the summer as soon as we have finished our final exams.",
