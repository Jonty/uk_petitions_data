        "action": "Make employers requiring driving licences, illegal outside selected professions.",
        "additional_details": "While roles, whose core or partial function is to drive a vehicle, the Armed Forces and parts of our Emergency Services need the requirement, there are a huge number of roles which have an \"Essential Requirement\" for \"A Full Driving Licence\" which don't. \r\nCompanies are removing many disabled people from their recruitment process entirely and perfectly within the law. \r\nThis petition calls for a law that would require an organisation to apply for the ability to exempt non driving licence holders.",
        "background": "The requirement of driving licences can be used as a selective tool to discriminate against disabilities. At present there is no law to prevent this from occurring and is excluding many able people from the recruitment process of jobs which don't require them in order to fulfil the role properly.",
