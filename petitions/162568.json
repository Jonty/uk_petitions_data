        "action": "One electronic recording system to safeguard all children and young people",
        "additional_details": "Legislation 'Keeping Children Safer in Education' specifies the legal duty for anyone working in Education.  We should have one clear piece of legislation that involves all agencies and states 'What we should do, how we should all work together to achieve it and how we record it.' Too many young people are slipping the net, through agencies not sharing and recording information on the same system.   Lessons learnt from serious case reviews, repeatedly comment on lack of shared communication.",
        "background": "Safeguarding is the responsibility of all agencies, yet we don't all have access to the same system for recording.  We all hold pieces to the puzzle but don't have access to the 'big picture'.  We can only safeguard our young people, if professionals work together to put the pieces together.",
