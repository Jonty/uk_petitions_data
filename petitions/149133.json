        "additional_details": "This is not about the results of the EU Referendum, it's about the state of our country's government. The reasons why this referendum was called in the first place are questionable, but the results have shown themselves to be divisive both within the parties themselves, and also within the very fabric of the people of this country.\r\n\r\nThe Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 requires the House of Commons to vote for no confidence, or for an early general election.\r\n\r\nI call on them to do so, now.",
        "background": "Recent months have shown divisive and misleading campaigns regarding the EU referendum on both sides.\r\nWe now have an elected parliament with deep divisions, and an opposition that is falling apart; all through lack of confidence and faith in their choices.\r\nI have no confidence, neither should you.",
