        "additional_details": "The 24% charge is a standard charge, whether payment is \u00a31 or \u00a31000.  This fee amounts to a lot for some paying parents and represents money that could be better spent on the children.  The CMS should at least explain the reasons for this extortionate fee level, and be transparent about what they actually do to deserve such a fee.  Monies already paid by parents should receive a refund along the lines of the PPI scandal.  (Will give CMS something to do!)",
        "background": "Paying parent pays 20% - receiving parent pays 4% to CMS for setting up direct debit.  Fees are disproportionate to the effort required by CMS to effect payment.  Fees are significantly more than fees charged to make simple bank transfer or BACS payment, regardless of the amount involved.",
