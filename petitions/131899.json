        "additional_details": "I am petitioning as I would like to see the government's new bill include a requirement for \u2018Talking Buses\u2019. These are buses which include on board audio-visual (A/V) next stop and final destination announcements, as well as other important information regarding the service. This vital assistive technology enables people who are blind or visually impaired to get the bus independently and with confidence.\r\n\r\nThis technology is a rarity outside London, and that needs to change!\r\n \r\n",
        "background": "If the government are reviewing the overall regulation of the industry then it would be a suitable time to ensure that bus networks are fully accessible. Audio-visual technology speaks and displays next and final stop information, assisting those visually impaired to use the bus with confidence.",
