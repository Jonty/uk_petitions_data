        "action": "Prevent UK based holiday providers overcharging during school holidays.",
        "additional_details": "This limit will help reduce school unauthorised absence rates, save families money during difficult economic times and stimulate the UK economy by encouraging families to holiday on home soil.  Holidays are an essential aspect of maintaining a healthy workforce and families should not be held to ransom by enormous price increases during 'peak times'.  Allowing a hike of 15% also allows holiday providers to make their seasonal profits during school holidays, but at a more reasonable rate.",
        "background": "Families are being squeezed from both sides regarding taking their kids on holiday.  Parents are being forced to take their kids out of school and risk a fine to be able to afford a family break.  I propose an upper limit of a 15% price hike to help families spend time together away from home.",
