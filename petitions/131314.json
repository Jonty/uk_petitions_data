        "additional_details": "Rebecca Kelsall, see http://dailym.ai/1UWGJNx, died because GPs failed to follow RCGP guidelines CR152 and the NICE guidelines CG90 and CG91. This showed that the health service can be slow in keeping abreast with latest guidelines. As coroners have a duty to investigate whether death was avoidable, they are best placed to monitor whether best practice guidelines are followed.  As such, coroners should persistently ask clinicians and others for reports about processes and procedures followed.",
        "background": "Worldwide studies show that the involvement of family, friends & carers helps to reduce suicide. The document, http://bit.ly/1VUKDI5, agreed by all the professional bodies, advocates that unless there are good reasons not to do so, consent should always be sought to involve family, friends & carers.",
