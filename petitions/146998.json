        "additional_details": "So my proposal is to make the National Insurance Number a required piece of information to sign a petition.\r\n\r\nThis way ONLY British Citizens over the age of 16 years of age can sign a Petition and they can only sign it once, as opposed to the current format in which a person only requires a different email to sign the same petition again.",
        "background": "In the highlight of the recent EU Referendum there is/was a Petition calling for a 2nd Referendum that received millions of signatures which received a lot of scrutiny.\r\n\r\nThis is because it is all too easy to sign a petition, there is no way to confirm that the person signing is a British Citizen.",
