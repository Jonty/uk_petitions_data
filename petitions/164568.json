        "additional_details": "Focus on sporting and academic departments take away sometimes completely from the vocational or artistic side. If that is a career a youth would want to pursue then it is the EDUCATION systems duty to EDUCATE the students on such matters! But no input or teaching on these skills are taught, hindering the abilities of our youths and holding them back from their potential, MANY, MANY people have a skill in vocational activities and subjects that could lead to a career in it. ",
        "background": "In state education here in the U.K our youth have next to no chances to properly further their vocational skills, e.g dance! Many schools not offering a thing in some of these areas that could potentially be the child's gift in life! For many school is the only outlet for them to progress in this.",
