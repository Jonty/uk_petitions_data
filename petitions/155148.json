        "additional_details": "The Referendum was a clear breach of the Human Rights of the voters in Scotland, Wales and N Ireland (representing 16.2% of the electorate) as whichever way they voted the result would still have been determined by the vote in England (83.8%). Because of the disenfranchisement of these voters it was not a UK vote but an England vote on behalf of the entire UK. The result should have required at least three countries to vote the same as the simple majority for a clear result to have occurred.\r\n",
        "background": "The electorate in England (38.9m) is substantially greater than the electorates in Scotland (3.99m), Wales (2.27m) and N Ireland (1.26m).  Thus the overall result is skewed in favour of the result in England to such an extent that the results in the other three countries are practically irrelevant.",
