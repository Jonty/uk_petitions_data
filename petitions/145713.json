        "additional_details": "The lead up to the EU Referendum in the UK has exposed our leaders as being at odds with the public they are meant to serve. A vote of no confidence is required, not just in the party leaders and our Prime Minister, but also in the way the public are represented, and the way in which decisions are made on public services.\r\n\r\nWe, the undersigned, call for an early election - within the year; with reform for proportional representation and the right to elect ministers based on their qualifications.",
        "background": "At a time where the country is in need of leadership, our representation has failed a public of diverse views. Reform is urgently needed to support a liberal democracy, with proportional representation; where ministers are elected based on their qualifications to represent a sector; all views count.",
