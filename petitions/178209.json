        "additional_details": "Prime Minister Theresa May has spoken of the 'shared society.' It would be nice to see some power being shared with our representatives at the UK Parliament and the devolved Parliaments and Assemblies. \r\n\r\nRegular digital voting on issues that matter at a local and national level, would leave everyone clear on what the majority wish for on any number of issues. A more intelligent vote could also arise; Eg: someone with good knowledge of farming would vote on it, though perhaps not vote on fishing.",
        "background": "The technology for 'push-button digital voting' by mobile phone or pc already exists. People vote on tv show contestants all the time. Mobile and online banking are deemed to be secure. Thus there's no reason why this technology cannot be adapted for digital referendums to truly empower the people.",
