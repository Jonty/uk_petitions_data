        "additional_details": "If this stopped just one person from an act of terrorism then isn't that enough?\r\n\r\nWe need to show strength against terrorism and by reinstating capital punishment we are showing those who are being groomed that they will be caught, trialled and put to death by a country that shows no fear against this hidious vermin.\r\n\r\nLet us unite against this evil by showing them that we are prepared to harden our laws and give the ultimate sentence to those who chose to try and destroy our way of life.",
        "background": "These people whom want to bring harm to us denounce any belonging to a country and should be seen as a relentless threat that needs to be eliminated. Terrorism has seen our citizens beheaded, burned and treated so inhumane that the people convicted deserve not to walk this earth.",
