        "additional_details": "By switching to an opt-out system, we can eliminate a large cause of the organ shortage: human inertia. We can save money by eliminating the need for marketing campaigns to stir us into action.\r\n\r\nIf a citizen feels strongly enough, he or she could simply remove himself from the database. Should they fail to do so, then at least our innate inertia might lead to some good.\r\n",
        "background": "On average, 3 people die every day waiting for an organ to be donated.\r\n\r\nThe majority of Britons support organ donation and want to donate and yet a mere 29% of us are on the register.\r\n\r\n",
