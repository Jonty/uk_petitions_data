        "additional_details": "Devon is not able to afford the support required by children with special needs and\r\ndisabilities, a decision was recently taken by the council to take another \u00a333 per pupil from the\r\nbudget of every school to pay back the deficit in this funding. This is an additional \u00a312,606 cut from\r\nour budget. The cumulative impact of all these cuts and rising costs is that we are faced with making\r\nsavings of around \u00a345,606 between now and 2019.\r\n\r\nHelp the future. Support our school. Willand \r\n",
        "background": "As one of the lowest funded local authorities, Devon has been campaigning for a number of years for\r\na fairer funding settlement which would bring the money allocated to Devon children closer to or even in line with the national average. \r\n",
