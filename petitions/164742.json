You may be interested to know that the Government has worked with the banks to develop a voluntary protocol on what should be done if there are plans to close branches: \r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/news/banks-agree-protocol-on-branch-closures\r\n\r\nIn addition, bank branch closures were debated in the House of Commons on 30 June. The link to the debate can be found here: http://www.parliament.uk/business/committees/committees-a-z/commons-select/backbench-business-committee/news-parliament-2015/debate-on-bank-branch-closures/\r\n\r\nWe could accept a petition about Post Office branches, because the Government wholly owns Post Office Ltd, which runs the network of post offices.
