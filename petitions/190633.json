        "background": "There is no legal minimum bay size and only \"guidance\" appears to be set by local councils. This has led to a number of issues affecting drivers including:\r\n-Inappropriate bays \"squeezed in\" to meet planning requirements\r\n-PCN fines despite the bay size not fit-for-purpose\r\n-Avoidable vehicle damage",
