        "additional_details": "It's common to see people who don't have a basic knowledge of the spectrum especially when it comes to Genders. We believe that the path to social equality starts by educating people and teaching about it in schools; if we can educate people on racism, why can't we educate people on Gender and Sexuality Discrimination?\r\nFrom personal experience I found the lack of education was disgusting and of no help to me as a gender fluid teenager.\r\nHow can i come out to people who don't know about my gender?",
        "background": "As more and more people are coming out as a member of LGBT+ community, it is important that our society and future members of society are correctly educated, in order for members of  the LGBT+ community to then be properly accepted.\r\nWe need to educate not only on Sexuality, but also the genders.
