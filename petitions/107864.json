            "details": "The Government has announced an investigation into the application of Sharia law in this country, to enhance our understanding of any ongoing misuse of Sharia law and the extent of the problem where it exists.  \r\n\r\nThere can be no question of there being a parallel system of law in this country.  There is one system of national law which applies equally to all citizens, regardless of religious belief. Practices that follow Sharia principles are therefore allowed to the extent that they also comply with the existing law in England and Wales. \r\n \r\nThe Government does not prevent individuals from seeking to regulate their lives through religious beliefs or cultural traditions. Communities and individuals have the option to use religious councils or any other system of alternative dispute resolution and to agree to abide by their decisions. However, these councils are not part of the court system in this country and have no legal means of enforcing their decisions. If decisions or recommendations are contrary to national law, including equalities legislation such as the Equality Act 2010, national law would prevail.  This is no different to any other council or tribunal - whether or not based on Sharia principles.\r\n\r\nAny individual or group is free to express views and beliefs, but they also have a duty to behave responsibly and to respect other people\u2019s rights.  Where there are behaviours and views which run counter to our shared values, these will be challenged by this Government. Promoting fairness in society is one of the Government's core commitments. This is everyone's responsibility; it is only together that we are able to develop a stronger and more cohesive society.\r\n\r\nMinistry of Justice",
