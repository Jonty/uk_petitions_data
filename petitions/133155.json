        "additional_details": "We believe the MOD has wasted many years avoiding any meaningful inquiry into Deepcut, even denying that an inappropriate culture existed there until very recently.\r\n\r\nYears that could have been used to reassure the parents of future recruits.\r\nYears that could have been used compassionately to listen and offer comfort to those recruits whose young lives have been so dreadfully affected.\r\nYears that should have been used to draw a line under this blot on the reputation of the British army.",
        "background": "This petition is in support of an application by LIBERTY on June 15, 2016 to the Rt Hon Michael Fallon MP, Secretary of State for Defence, requesting that he convene an independent public inquiry into allegations of physical, sexual and psychological abuse at Deepcut barracks between 1993 and 2002",
