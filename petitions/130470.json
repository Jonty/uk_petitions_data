        "additional_details": "However, tickets for an event in September I booked just a few weeks ago have already arrived! It is disgusting how companies like Ticketmaster can hold tickets for so long, when they were booked over 6 months ago & they can arrive as late as 5 working days before the event. That does not allow for potential hiccups in the system. I believe that Ticketmaster NEEDS to change their policies and procedures, & that tickets should be sent out much quicker than this! Atleast a month before the event.",
        "background": "I and many others have booked tickets for events. The current event I am concerned with is the currently running Busted tour. I have a friend who has lost tickets in the post and the event is this coming Saturday. And mine have yet to be printed even! Yet the event is less than 2 weeks away!",
