        "additional_details": "Since the EU Referendum was held on 23 June, the UK political system and economy has been in turmoil. Many people feel that they have been misled by claims from both sides and would have voted differently had they been in full possession of the facts. Both the government and its opposition continue to fragment, and as a result, citizens of the UK have no idea who will effect the exit from the EU, or have any idea of the potential outcome from any perspective.",
        "background": "We the undersigned call upon HM Government to postpone invocation of Article 50 of the Treaty of Lisbon - triggering the formal UK exit from the European Union - prior to the the outcome of a UK General Election.",
