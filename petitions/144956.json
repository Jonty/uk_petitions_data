        "additional_details": "This EU question is so huge with such far reaching actions & reactions with many who voted to leave realising very quickly they have made a huge mistake that the UK/EU vote should be allowed to be redone as the future of the UK, Europe & the whole World are tied to this very important vote & if the Scottish get a second go then so should the UK.",
        "background": "The 2016 UK/EU referendum was so close that the UK is divided with many voting to Leave the EU on promises made by the Leave campaign that proved untrue.\r\nThe Scottish want a second referendum on their independence from the UK so if that is allowed the UK should be allowed to vote again on the EU.",
