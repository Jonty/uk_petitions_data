        "action": "Hold a public inquiry into the institutional bullying of carers by officialdom.",
        "additional_details": "The institutional bullying of carers (and those they care for) is a regular occurrence within local authorities, the NHS and care companies.\r\n\r\nIf carers stand up for the person they care for, or make a complaint, they are targeted; facing bullying, harassment and intimidation from those who are supposed to help and support them. Tactics employed against carers include the abuse of the MCA, MHA and safeguarding, deliberately incorrect assessments of capacity/need, general harassment and threats. \r\n",
        "background": "The institutional bullying of family carers (and those they care for) by various official bodies is now a nationally recognised phenomenon. It is known as 'mother blame' (men are also targeted). A public inquiry into this phenomenon is imperative - to address the issues and halt the practice.",
