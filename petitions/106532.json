I was unaware of the process of emailing and CVs because I simply wasn't taught it. Schools seem to focus on drugs and alcohol more than allowing us students the tools we need to live in society!",

However, I haven't been taught how to write a CV, how to pay taxes, nor how to get a mortgage or a loan. These to me, are all life lessons that sorely need to be taught.",
