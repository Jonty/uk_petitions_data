        "additional_details": "Government statistics from 2011 show that 22% of road fatalities in that year involved drivers aged 17-24. A motorcycle-style age and licence grading system needs to be enforced to reduce these figures.",
        "background": "Young bikers are restricted as to how powerful a bike they can ride based on their age & licence type, yet car drivers can drive any car at any age once they've passed a manual test. This leaves fast cars in the hands of people who aren't competent to drive them, and is also unfair to bikers.",
