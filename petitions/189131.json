        "additional_details": "According to the Nottingham post, previous studies have shown that upto 250 cars a day ignore the 'congestion-busting' measure and drive through it even with a threat of recieving a \u00a360 fine. This statement proves how important this cut through is, as people know they could recieve a penalty and still proceed to go through. This route reduces around a mile and a half off journey time for people driving from Burton Joyce and Stoke Bardolph area heading into Gedling and Netherfield. ",
        "background": "Open the bus lane on Stoke Lane through to Colwick loop road to help save fuel emmissions by not having to travel as far. It will also help congestion on Burton road in peak times. It is a big pain for local residents who want to drive to Carlton Town Football Club as it doubles there journey time. ",
