        "additional_details": "There is a shameful stigma and a culture of misinformation surrounding abuse. Seeing that education is the way forward, giving our youth the chance to learn about something that touches on the life of 1 in 4 women and 1 in 6 men could be crucial to achieving equality and saving lives.",
        "background": "77% of young people claim that they do not have access to information on healthy and abusive relationships. By introducing education on abusive relationships to the National Curriculum, abuse and intimate partner violence could be prevented- saving the UK millions and reducing death rates. ",
