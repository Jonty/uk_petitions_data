        "additional_details": "We already have separate regiments for the Scots, the Irish and the Welsh so we can extend this to other communities living in the UK. Soldiers working together from the same culture have a great understanding of their common history and heritage and are further motivated to preserve and protect their honour.\r\n \r\nIt is only right that we re-enact this regiment which has such a proud history and heritage to inspire our future generations. ",
        "background": "A Sikh regiment within the British army will draw upon their reputation of fearless military prowess in much the same way as it has done for the Gurkhas. The Sikh Regiment was the most decorated in the British Empire. They were awarded more Victoria Crosses per head than any other community. ",
