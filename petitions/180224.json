        "additional_details": "The process would ensure anyone entering the UK illegally, from countries like France & Germany, would be immediately returned to that country. It would also leave us less open to terror attacks from undocumented migrants, and from Muslims that are known to security services in other countries, yet they fail to disclose that given information until an attack has occurred.",
        "background": "Following recent attacks, the latest being in Quebec, that were committed by Muslims, immigrants & refugees, it is time for the UK to impose stricter vetting processes for those entering our shores. ",
