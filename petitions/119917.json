        "additional_details": "Under 18's get dental care for free because they don't earn money. Pensioners also no longer earn money. The only money they have will eventually run out so why shouldn't they do what they like instead of what they have to?",
        "background": "I don't not think that pensioners who have spent most of their life paying into their pension, should have to pay for dental care. They have worked extremely hard for that money and they have to pay extortionate amounts for things they should be getting for free.",
