        "action": "Increase hours spent in the curriculum teaching ICT",
        "additional_details": "Almost every workplace in our country needs young people to be able to use a computer, whether that be sending or receiving emails, programming or using Microsoft Office or similar programmes. In a recent study undertaken, programming was selected as becoming the most sought-after profession in 10 years time. To fill this vital gap, we need to educate young people more effectively about computing, so they are equipped for possibly their future profession or their life ahead. Thank you.",
        "background": "In this age of computing becoming increasingly important in the workplace, ICT learning hours in school should be increased in order for young people to be knowledgeable about using the internet and programming.",
