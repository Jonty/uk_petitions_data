        "additional_details": "The voting was very close, with less than on third of the UK's population voting to leave the EU. Evidence suggests that the leaving vote was skewed heavily against younger voters i.e. those who will have to cope with any problems for the longest.\r\nA delay to initiating leaving the EU, for say, a year or two, would allow for calm reflection whilst the consequences become clearer.\r\nThis is the time when leadership might best be displayed by saying \"No, the mandate for leaving is simply not that strong, and we are not yet ready to act on it.\"",
        "background": "The EU Referendum is described as an 'Advisory' vote, so it is not mandatory for the government to act on it. We therefore urge Parliament to choose for themselves not to leave the EU at the present time. ",
