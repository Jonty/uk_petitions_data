        "action": "UK to offer free trade deals with any EU country that votes out in a referendum",
        "additional_details": "This petition will have the effect of showing the world we are standing on our own two feet and ready to trade as normal with everybody who is free to trade with us, without the shackles of corrupt trade dictatorships.\r\nIt will also send a strong message to those silly billies who want a second referendum, a vote in parliament etc, and continue, in the face of our improving prospects to still continue to run down the UK in order to satisfy their own power aspirations and personal gain.",
        "background": "With the EU starting to fall apart now is the time for the UK Government to offer the EU countries who are about to hold their own In/Out referendums the help and understanding they deserve by offering them a open trade deal with Great Britain if they vote for an exit.  ",
