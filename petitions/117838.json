        "additional_details": "Statistically Lincolnshire performs higher (on average) than any other country within EMAS, this is mainly due to the assistance from the voluntary and charitable services locally. Unfortunately the NHS Ambulance Service (EMAS) is providing the public of Lincolnshire with an inadequate service both in terms of response times and clinical ability. A local county led (Lincolnshire) Ambulance Service would provide services specifically for the needs of the public of Lincolnshire.",
        "background": "Since the amalgamation of Lincolnshire with East Midlands Ambulance Service (EMAS) waiting times for Ambulances have become increasingly worse for the public of Lincolnshire. This is mainly due to resources being targeted at population centres where its perceived performance targets can be achieved.",
