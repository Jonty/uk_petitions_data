        "action": "Stop cutting the bursaries for healthcare students",
        "additional_details": "The Government say their policy to remove bursaries will increase the number of students applying for these courses, but UCAS has revealed a 23% reduction in applications in England for nursing courses beginning in 2017.\r\n \r\nThe withdrawal of bursaries and introduction of loans will be detrimental in recruiting the healthcare professionals of the future and cause financial hardship for those who want to work in our NHS. This policy, on top of a 92% decrease in the number of EU nurses registering for the Nursing and Midwifery Council since the result of the EU referendum, will lead to an even greater crisis in health care provision.\r\n",
        "background": "The Government should reconsider the removal of bursaries for nursing, midwifery and allied health professional university courses and defer its implementation whilst proper consultation on the best way to fund healthcare students, and pilots of different options are undertaken.
