        "additional_details": "The UK pays in more to defence than any other member of NATO outside of the USA. \r\nBy further increasing our spending to 3%, almost a match to the USA, we solidify our commitment to NATO, showing America that we support the President's call and are the USA's true friend and ally in this matter.\r\nWe will show other large NATO nations that they must do more to help the defence of the alliance.\r\nhttp://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2016_01/20160129_160128-pr-2016-11-eng.pdf",
        "background": "The US accounts for 72% of total spending in NATO. \r\nPresident-elect Donald J Trump has called for the remaining members to pay their share, 2% GDP, on defence. \r\nThe UK has an opportunity to lead the way and break through the 2% of GDP, showing Europe that we must take the NATO alliance seriously",
