The committee should be free of proffessional politicians. All nominees selected by clp's then voted at party conferences. The committee has teeth a majority vote and should a jounalist or Editor allow a biased broadcast to be made without equal time to the opposite view in that broadcast then a reprimand be issued 3 reprimands automatic dismissal.

There is clearly a conflict of interests between being a right wing journalist and political editor of the BBC. This should not happen and is not appropiate behaviour of a publicly funded organisation.",
