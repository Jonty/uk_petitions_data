        "additional_details": "We must oppose this, any attempted bombing of Syria shall result in British citizens being put at a hugely costly risk, this also is beyond party politics it is a matter of security and absolutely paramount to the future of innocent people whose deaths can be avoided. We must all unite, from across the party spectrum. I don't care if you're right wing, left wing, authoritarian or libertarian you all know in your hearts and minds that bombing in Syria will mean being subjugated to more horrors. ",
        "background": "I am an admin on the biggest and fastest growing political debating platform known as \"British Politics.\" I have run campaigns before, but none are as important as this. Which is why I am extending a hand of friendship to all those who would oppose the disastrous plan of bombing Syria.",
