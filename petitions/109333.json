        "additional_details": "By 2020 this 75p per month would have risen to less than \u00a31.17 to maintain the current rate of renewables deployment.\r\n\r\nReference: DECC Report - Performance and Impact of the Feed-in Tariff Scheme: Review of Evidence:\r\n\r\nSee - Table 2 Page 7 - Impact on domestic bill\r\n\r\nhttps://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/456181/FIT_Evidence_Review.pdf\r\n\r\nInstead the alternative is Government propose to spend \u00a325-Billion on Nuclear, using either Tax Payer's money or investment from China.\r\n\r\nNuclear will also need to be subsidised and so also add burden to energy bills.\r\n\r\nRenewables make sense. \r\n",
        "background": "The Gov are proposing to cut FIT subsidies for deployment of Renewable technologies in the UK claiming they want to reduce burden on domestic energy bills. \r\nA recent DECC study calculated this burden was in fact just \u00c2\u00a39/year (75p/month) in 2014\r\nThe alternative is NUCLEAR & FRACKING.\r\n",
