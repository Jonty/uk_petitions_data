        "additional_details": "Almost 140,000 holidaymakers have been hit by the collapse of online travel agency Lowcostholidays - family trips, honeymoons and destination weddings thrown into chaos and some losing holidays worth \u00a31,000s. The administrator says those affected include 27,000 people who were already abroad when the news was announced last Friday, and a further 110,000 who had booked but not yet travelled. The Spanish regulator now says those reclaiming via it may get as little as \u00a37 per person.",
        "background": "We would like the Government & Parliament to look into how they can let a company like www.lowcostholidays.com get away with taking so many British Citizens money, right up to their administration. Plus why they used the ATOL logo outside of their terms and ATOL didn't check or let customers know.",
