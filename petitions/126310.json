They are extremely successful at closing the gap between the most disadvantaged children and their peers. They are led by specialist headteachers & employ qualified teachers & nursery nurses. 64% are in the 30% most deprived areas in England. \r\nSee the Early Education report: 'Maintained Nursery Schools: the state of play' March 2015 for more info",
