        "additional_details": "Trump's ban on refugees will disproportionately affect LGBTQ+ refugees and asylum seekers. The UK has an enviable cultural and legal stance that protects LGBTQ+ people. Helping people from this community that will face extreme danger would not only uphold our values as a nation, but send a strong message to the Trump administration that we do not accept his persecution of marginalised communities. We ask the UK government to extend a welcome and provide protection to communities seeking asylum.",
        "background": "Trump's ban on refugees in the US will have a devastating effect on LGBTQ+ people seeking refuge. It will impact LGBTQ+ asylum seekers and refugees already living in the US. We call on the UK government to uphold Britain's outstanding respect for, and protection of, LGBTQ+ people and rights. \r\n\r\n",
