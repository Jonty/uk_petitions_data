UK Petitions Data
=================

This is a complete dump of all the [UK Government and Parliament Petitions website](https://petition.parliament.uk/) data, which is published under the [OGL](https://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/doc/open-government-licence/version/3/).

This also includes a complete machine-readable dump of the old `petitions.number10.gov.uk` website that started it all.

Current State
